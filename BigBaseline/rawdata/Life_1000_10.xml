==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1996-1999)===
Tony's friends Robert and Jerry traveled to [[Arkansas]] to train with professional wrestlers [[The Moondogs]] and invited him to come along.&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; After watching several training sessions, Tony was invited into the ring. He soon began training alongside his friends, free of charge, because [[Moondog Spot]] felt that Tony "was a natural for the business."&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; Tony started wrestling in [[Indiana]] in a small bingo hall, where he first met wrestler [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]].&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; He, Robinson, and [[Mad Man Pondo]] began traveling throughout the country together.&lt;ref name="WWD10"&gt;{{cite video |people=2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson (Interviewees) |date=2010-09-27 |title=Wrestling with Disaster 10 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIvaXDWOgOM  |medium=internet production |publisher=Legit Wrestling |accessdate=2010-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video distribution company Smart Mark Video helped the trio gain national exposure.&lt;ref name="WWD10"/&gt;

===Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (1999-2007)===
Tony began working for [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South]] (IWA-MS) in 1999. He wrestled his first match against Rolling Hard, where he was introduced to the [[hardcore wrestling]] style of the company.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mr. Wrestling (interviewer), 2 Tuff Tony (interviewee) |date=2011-03-02 |title=JCW's 2 Tuff Tony on Ultraviolent Radio 3-2-2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRaIOS28ts |medium=Internet Interview |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that Tony had never wrestled in the hardcore style before, Mad Man Pondo requested to work with him in matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; The promotion's owner, [[Ian Rotten]], supported the idea and booked the two in a rivalry.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; Pondo acquainted him to the proper techniques of hardcore wrestling, and Tony later recalled that Pondo "took good care of me" in their matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt;

On April 29, 1999, Tony defeated Pondo for the [[IWA Mid-South Hardcore Championship]].&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-hc.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Hardcore Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the championship on May 14 to Pondo, but won it back the following day.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt; The following February he lost the championship, but won the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] two weeks later.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-h.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Heavyweight Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, he defeated Pondo and Delilah Starr to unify the IWA-MS Hardcore and Heavyweight Championships.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; Two weeks later, Tony lost the championship.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; He won it for a second time the following March 2, before losing it to Mitch Page a month later.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt;

In 2006, Tony and Mad Man Pondo took part in the first [[IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch#IWA Mid-South Double Death Tag Team Tournament|Double Death Tag Team Tournament]], though they weren't told which team would win the tournament.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; They defeated Children of Pain then Dysfunction and Corporal Robinson to make it to the finals. In the finals, Tony and Pondo defeated Tough Crazy Bastards to be crowned the first Double Death Tag Team Tournament champions.

Tony continued wrestling for Juggalo Championship Wrestling, including matches at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] festivals and two other videos released by the company.

Tony went on tour with JCW in 2007 to film the [[internet]] [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] show [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling#SlamTV!|SlamTV!]], where he was involved in a rivalry with [[Tracy Smothers]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-09-18|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194583|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy attacked Tony in the sixth episode, causing Tony to be knocked out of action for several weeks.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Per storyline, Smothers was arrested just days before Tony's return on the eighth episode, leaving Tony with no way to seek revenge.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Tony was attacked by [[Bull Pain]] at East Side Wars, but later defeated him in a [[Hillerich &amp; Bradsby|Louisville Slugger]] match at [[Bloodymania (2007)|Bloodymania]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-10-30|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194584/|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2008, Tony and [[Violent J]] won the [[JCW Tag Team Championship]]. However, their victory was declared void, stricken from the record, and the title was vacated.&lt;ref name="Jan262008"&gt;{{cite web |title=JCW January 26, 2008 |url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=1&amp;nr=18279 |publisher=Cagematch |accessdate=13 August 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlamTV2-1"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Slam TV Season 2 - Episode 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ph1KX5BiQ |series=SlamTV! |credits=Creator and Producer: [[Insane Clown Posse]] |location=Toledo, Ohio |airdate=2008-06-16 |season=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Main Event Feb 22"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Feb 22, 2011|series=The Main Event |url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wpress/?p=51 |credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]] |station=WFKO |airdate=2011-02-22 |minutes= 3:21:00|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512054432/http://wfuckoffradio.com/the-main-event|archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony continued his rivalry with Tracy Smothers into season two of SlamTV!

At the 2008 Hallowicked After-Party, Tony joined the group the [[Juggalo World Order]].

He debuted in 1990, wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] under the [[ring name]] "Al the Sledgehammer".&lt;ref name="iwatapings1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1softball.com/WBS/WrestlingBookingSheet291.htm |title=The Wrestling Booking Sheet - Issue #291 |first=Steve |last=Appenrodt |date=1999-08-30 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ytiwasledgehammer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7gHi_sgkAw |title=IWA Championship Wrestling - Derrick Dukes vs Al The Sledgehammer |first=Rob |last=Russen |year=1990 |accessdate=2013-08-30|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994-1996)===
Poling achieved his greatest national exposure in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Werstling]] (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed "handler" to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] on the January 18, 1994 episode of ''[[ECW Hardcore TV|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'' by defeating [[Chad Slivenski|Chad Austin]]. He joined [[Paul Heyman]]'s [[Dangerous Alliance]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]] with Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. His [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was as an enforcer of the "extreme" attitude; he was named '''911''' at ''The Night The Line was Crossed'' on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the [[chokeslam]] on others with little provocation, which made him quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#over|popular]] with the crowd as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/24/pf-729421.html|title=SLAM! Speaks: What we miss about ECW|author=SLAM Wrestling staff|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2015|date=November 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first title shot in ECW at ''When Worlds Collide'', where he challenged [[Mikey Whipwreck]] for the [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW Television Championship]] but got disqualified after chokeslamming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]].  He would then enter a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]], whom he defeated at [[Hardcore Heaven (1994)|Hardcore Heaven]]. On August 27, at the [[NWA World Title Tournament]], 911 participated in the [[ECW tournaments#NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tournament|namesake tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he defeated [[Doink the Clown]] in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed the year by defeating [[The Pitbulls]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] at [[Holiday Hell (1994)|Holiday Hell]]. Poling received the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[PWI Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.

Poling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] and [[Jim Steele (wrestler)|Jim Steele]] at ''Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams''. At the [[House Party (1996)|1996 House Party]] [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|event]], 911 teamed with [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat [[The Eliminators]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]], which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with [[Tazz|Taz]] after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===World Championship Wrestling (1996-1997)===
Poling wrestled in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone,&lt;ref name="nt19961223"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Monday Nitro|series= WCW Monday Nitro|serieslink= WCW Monday Nitro|station= TNT (TV channel)|airdate= 1996-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sledge Hammer&lt;ref name="sn19970215"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Big Al.&lt;ref name="sn19970111"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970412"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970510"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with [[Tank Abbott]] in WCW in early 2000.

===Return to ECW===
In 1998, Poling returned to ECW at [[UltraClash (1998)|UltraClash]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, [[chokeslam]]ming [[Bill Wiles]].

They were then interrupted by [[Spike Dudley]] and had an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#impromptu match|impromptu match]], which 911 lost in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|under a minute]].

===Independent circuit===
Throughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the [[New Jersey]] based [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] promotion, winning the [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship]] on two occasions. He made an appearance at [[Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling]] ''A War Renewed'' on June 29th, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of [[Tod Gordon]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], delivering a chokeslam to [[Sandman (wrestler)|Sandman]] (who had just been betrayed by his partner, [[Bill Alfonso]]). At ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'' in 2005 he chokeslammed both [[Danny Doring]] and [[Roadkill (wrestler)|Roadkill]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008.

'''9ice''' (born '''Abolore Ajifolajifaola Adegbola Akande''', on 17 January 1980){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} is a Nigerian musician. He is a south-westerner from [[Ogbomoso]] in [[Oyo State]] but he grew up in the district of [[Bariga]] in [[Lagos]].

9ice won the award for Best Hip Hop Artist at the [[MTV Africa Music Awards 2008#Best Hip-Hop|MTV Africa Music Awards]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerians sweep MTV Africa awards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7744492.stm|accessdate=13 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[The Headies 2008|third edition of the Hip Hop World Awards]] held in Nigeria, he won the [[The Headies Award for Hip Hop World Revelation of the Year|Revelation of the Year award]] and  [[The Headies Award for Best Vocal Performance (Male)|Best Male Vocal Performer]]. A month later at the first SoundCity Music Video Awards, he was nominated in the category of Best New Artist. 9ice's biggest single is titled "Gongo Aso". He is the founder of [[Alapomeji Records]].

In 2014, 9ice revealed that he was going to contest for a political office in his native Ogbomosho in Oyo state. He joined the All Progressive Congress (APC) and declared his interest to contest for a seat at the Federal House of Representatives. He lost out during the primaries. 9ice was  named as a Special Adviser to the Oyo state Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi.

==Growing up==
9ice attended Abule Okuta Primary School and [[CMS Grammar School, Lagos|CMS Grammar School]], and dropped out from his law course at the [[Lagos State University]] to concentrate on music. He grew up in a [[Polygamy|polygamous]] home of five wives and nine children. His parents found about his singing career a year after it started around 2000. Before then, 9ice wrote his own songs, beginning at age 14. As a big fan of Pasuma Wonder, he kick-started his singing career with [[Fuji music]].  He derives his inspiration from his environment, and music from the likes of [[Ebenezer Obey]], [[King Sunny Adé]], Tatalo Alamu, the late Alhaji Ayinla Omowura, and the late Alhaji Haruna Ishola.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Early career==
After recording his first demo, 9ice joined the group Mysterious Boys, with whom he did a couple of tracks before going on to form his own, now defunct, group, Abinibi. Having recorded his first demo, titled ''Risi De Alagbaja'', in 1996, and his first solo song, "Little Money" in 2000, 9ice had to wait until 2005 before gaining recognition in the [[Nigerian music]] market.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The first major break for 9ice came from his first single, "Little Money". Soon after this, he did collaborations with different Nigerian artists that  prompted the release of another hit single, "Ganja Man". ID Cabasa produced this single,  which was released with other songs in March 2006. The [[reggae]] tone and playful style of the song made it an instant hit. 9ice later founded his own record company and released all other albums under that label, Alapomeji Records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Solo album and sophomore break==
9ice's first album did well, and included the songs "Little Money", "Ganja Man", "Make Dem Talk" and "Music Daddy". ''Gongo Aso'', his second album, included songs covering success, originality, partying and women, as well as themes on the institution of marriage and gratitude. He has eight studio albums to his name which includes; Certificate (2007), Gongo Aso  (2008), Tradition (2009), Versus (2011) Bashorun Gaa (2011), Deluxe Version Versus &amp; Bashorun Gaa (2011), CNN/GRA (2014) and ID Cabasa (2016).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pulse.ng/buzz/9ice-singer-releases-8th-studio-album-titled-id-cabasa-id5792433.html&lt;/ref&gt;
He is recognized to be the first Nigerian hip-hop artist to release two albums in a year which are C.N.N (Canceling Numerous Negativity) and G.R.A (Galvanizing Right Ahead).

==Live shows==
Since late 2007 9ice has featured prominently across Nigerian campuses in the Soundcity/MTN Campus Blast tours; Lets Go There Tour With Ariya Entertainment in NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, Maryland in 2008; [[Star Mega Jam]] in 2007-2010; and London [[Troxy]] in 2008 and 2010. 9ice performed at the [[Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute]] concert (singing "Gongo Aso") in London on 27 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7475962.stm |title=Reporter's log, Mandela concert |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=1 July 2008 |date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these shows and concerts were sold-out events. He also headlined sold-out shows in the Netherlands and Malaysia in October 2010 to mark his country's 50-year anniversary of independence. In 2010, 9ice embarked on a European tour through parts of Italy, Spain and Switzerland. He also performed live in [[Cyprus]] at Lions Garden, where many  Nigerian students were in attendance.

==His style==
9ice is known for his use of the [[Yoruba language]] in his music, and he sometimes mixes Yoruba proverbs with English, broken English, Hausa and Igbo. 9ice compares himself to [[Youssou N'Dour]], who has won a couple of [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awards  with music recorded in his mother tongue, and [[Yvonne Chaka Chaka]], whose music has also embraced her language. 9ice has been quoted as saying, "English language has been imposed on us but God graciously gave Yoruba language to us."

In January 2014, 9ice announced plans to run for a political office in 2015 as a House of Representatives member representing the Ogbomoso North Constituency, Oyo state in the National Assembly. He contested for the seat under the umbrella of the APC but lost at the party primaries.

In April 2015, the “Gongo Aso” singer was appointed a special adviser to the governor of Oyo state, Abiola Ajimobi.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Amrita''' ({{lang-sa|अमृत}}, [[IAST]]: ''amṛta''), '''Amrit''' or '''Amata''' (also called Sudha, Amiy, Ami) is a word that literally means "immortality" and is often referred to in texts as [[nectar]]. "Amṛta" is etymologically related to the Greek ''[[ambrosia]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter W. Skeat]], ''Etymological English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; and carries the same meaning.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Ambrosia" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first occurrence is in the [[Rigveda]], where it is considered one of several synonyms for ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]'', the drink of the devas.

Amrit has varying significance in different [[Indian religions]]. The word ''Amrit'' is also a common first name for Sikhs and North Indian [[Hindu]]s, while its feminine form is ''Amritā''.  The traditional masculine name is ''Amritha'' with the feminine name being ''Amrithi''.

== Hinduism ==
[[File:Mohini with amrit.jpg|thumb|[[Mohini]], the female form of [[Vishnu]], holding the pot of amritha which she distributes amongst all the [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]], leaving the [[asura]]s without. [[Darasuram]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India|alt=A stone carving of a standing woman with a pot in her left hand and lotus in right.]]
The amṛta is repeatedly referred to as the drink of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], which grants them immortality. Despite this, the nectar does not actually offer true immortality: instead, by partaking it, the devas were able to attain a higher level of knowledge and power, which they had lost due to the curse of Sage [[Durvasa]].

The amṛta features in the [[samudra manthan]]a legend, which describes how the devas, because of a curse from the sage [[Durvasa]], begin to lose their immortality. Assisted by their rivals, the [[asura]]s, the devas begin to churn the ocean, releasing (among other extraordinary objects and beings) the amṛta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 66|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amṛta is sometimes said to miraculously form on, or flow from, statues of Hindu gods. The substance is consumed by worshippers and is alleged to be sweet-tasting and not at all similar to honey or sugar water.

Amṛta was the last of the fourteen treasures that emerged from the churning of the ocean and contained in a pot borne by [[Dhanvantari]], the physician of the devas.

== Sikhism ==
Amrit ({{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ}}) is the name of the holy water used in the [[baptism]] ceremony or [[Amrit Sanchar]] in [[Sikhism]]. This ceremony is observed to initiate the Sikhs into the [[Khalsa]] and requires drinking amrit. This is created by mixing a number of soluble ingredients, including sugar, and is then rolled with a [[Khanda (sword)|khanda]] with the accompaniment of scriptural recitation of five sacred verses.

Metaphorically, God's name is also referred to as a nectar:
&lt;poem&gt;ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਸਬਦੁ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਹਰਿ ਬਾਣੀ ॥ 
अम्रित सबदु अम्रित हरि बाणी ॥ 
Amrit sabad amrit har baṇi.
The [[Shabda]] is Amrit; the Lord's ''bani'' is Amrit. 
 
ਸਤਿਗੁਰਿ ਸੇਵਿਐ ਰਿਦੈ ਸਮਾਣੀ ॥ 
सतिगुरि सेविऐ रिदै समाणी ॥ 
Satgur seviai ridai samāṇi.
Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart. 
 
ਨਾਨਕ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਨਾਮੁ ਸਦਾ ਸੁਖਦਾਤਾ ਪੀ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਸਭ ਭੁਖ ਲਹਿ ਜਾਵਣਿਆ
Nānak amrit nām sadā sukhdāta pi amrit sabh bhukh lėh jāvaṇia.
O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib]], page 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

== Theravada Buddhism ==
According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], "the deathless" refers to the deathless dimension of the mind which is dwelled in permanently after [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;"All About Change", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 5 June 2010, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/change.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amata Sutta, [[the Buddha]] advises monks to stay with the four [[Satipatthana]]: "Monks, remain with your minds well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness. Don't let the deathless be lost to you."&lt;ref&gt;"Amata Sutta: Deathless" (SN 47.41), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 17 February 2012, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn47/sn47.041.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Milinda Panha|questions for Nagasena]], King Milinda asks for evidence that the Buddha once lived, wherein Nagasena describes evidence of the Dhamma in a simile:

{{quote|"Revered Nagasena, what is the nectar shop of the Buddha, the Blessed One?"

"Nectar, sire, has been pointed out by the Blessed One. With this nectar the Blessed One sprinkles the world with the [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s; when the devas and the humans have been sprinkled with this nectar, they are set free from birth, aging, disease, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. What is this nectar? It is [[Kayagatasati Sutta|mindfulness occupied with the body]]. And this too, sire, was said by the Blessed One: 'Monks, they partake of nectar (the deathless) who partake of mindfulness that is occupied with the body.' This, sire, is called the Blessed One's nectar shop."

— Miln 335&lt;ref&gt;"The Blessed One's City of Dhamma: From the Milindapañha", based on the translation by I.B. Horner. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/horner/bl130.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Vajrayana Buddhism ==
{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Ideas and practices}}
Amritha ({{bo|w=bdud rtsi|s=dütsi}}) also plays a significant role in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] as a sacramental drink which is consumed at the beginning of all important rituals such as the [[abhisheka]], [[ganachakra]], and [[Homa (ritual)|homa]]. In the Tibetan tradition, ''dütsi'' is made during [[drubchen]]s - lengthy ceremonies involving many high [[lama]]s. It usually takes the form of small, dark-brown grains that are taken with water, or dissolved in very weak solutions of alcohol and is said to improve physical and spiritual well-being.&lt;ref name="dutsi"&gt;[http://150.135.84.34/~scar/DrikungKagyu/dutsi.pdf Dutsi], A Brief Description of the Benefits of the Sacred Ambrosial Medicine, The Unsurpassable, Supreme Samaya Substance that Liberates Through Taste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundational text of [[traditional Tibetan medicine]], the Four Tantras, is also known by the name ''The Heart of Amrita'' ({{bo|w=snying po bsdus pa}}).

''The Immaculate Crystal Garland'' ({{bo|w=dri med zhal phreng}}) describes the origin of amrita in a version of the [[samudra manthan]]a legend retold in Buddhist terms. In this Vajrayana version, the monster [[Rahu]] steals the amrita and is blasted by [[Vajrapani]]'s thunderbolt. As Rahu has already drunk the amrita he cannot die, but his blood, dripping onto the surface of this earth, causes all kinds of medicinal plants to grow. At the behest of all the Buddhas, Vajrapani reassembles Rahu who eventually becomes a protector of Buddhism according to the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

''Inner Offering'' ({{bo|w=Nang chod}}, {{zh|t=内供}}) is the most symbolic Amrita offering assembly, and the ''Inner Offering Nectar Pill'' ({{bo|w=Nang chod bdud rtsi rilbu}}, {{zh|t=内供甘露丸}}) is a precious and secret medicine of Tibetan Buddhism, which are only used internally for higher ranking monks in Nyingma school. Its ingredients including Five Amrita and Five Meat, which represents five buddha, and five elements respectively. According to ''[[Tantras]] of [[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|Chakravarti]]'', and ''Tantras of [[Vajravārāhī]]'', a ceremony needs to be hold for melting and blessing the Inner Offering Nectar. Five Nectar needs to be arranged in four directions: yellow excrement in the east, green bone marrow in the north, white semen in the west and red blood in the south, blue urine is placed in the center. Four Nectar should come from [[Lama|wise monks]] and the ova should be collected from the first menstruation of a blessed woman. The Five Meats are arranged similiarly, meat of black bull in the southeast, the meat of the blue dog in the southwest, the meast of the white elephant in the northwest, the meat of the green horse in the northeast, and the meat of a red human corpse in the center. After the ceremony, these ingredients will transform into an ''one taste'' (''ekarasa'') elixir, which bestows bliss, vitality, immortality and wisdom. Actual practitioner will take a 'synthesized essence' of the Nectar Pill and combined it with black tea or alcohol, but mostly the "Nectar Pill" are derived from plants.&lt;ref&gt;The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols, Robert Beer. {{ISBN|1590301005}}, Boston, MA. :Shambhala, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhism describes Amrita ({{zh|t=甘露|p=gānlù}}) as blessed water, food, or other consumable objects often produced through merits of chanting mantras.

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

The US carries out 46% of global research and development (R&amp;D) in life sciences, making it the world leader.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Stewart|first=Shannon|last2=Springs|first2=Stacy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal expenditure on biomedical research ==
Life sciences accounted for 51% of federal research expenditure in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:R&amp;D budget by US agency, 1994–2014.svg|thumb|Research budget by US agency, 1994-2014. Source: Figure 5.4 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) are considered the government's flagship biomedical research funding organization. Between 2004 and 2014, NIH funding remained relatively flat and was not increased to keep pace with [[inflation]].  The NIH budget peaked at circa $35 billion per year from 2003 to 2005 and was around $30 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Government efforts to increase allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress withholding approval of the federal government's budget several times. Over this period, the executive’s priorities were taken forward largely thanks to collaboration between the government, industry and the non-profit sector. This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towards more targeted therapies ==
A key policy objective of the Obama administration was to develop more targeted therapies while reducing the time and cost of drug development. Developing a new drug takes well over a decade and has a failure rate of more than 95%. The most expensive failures happen in late phase clinical trials. It is thus vital to pinpoint the right biological targets (genes, proteins and other molecules) early in the process, so as to design more rational drugs and better tailored therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[21st Century Cures Act]] was signed into law on 13 December 2016, a year after the release of the [[UNESCO Science Report]]. The report had predicted that, ‘were the bill to pass into law, it would alter the way in which clinical trials are conducted by allowing new and adaptive trial designs that factor in personalized parameters, such as biomarkers and genetics. This provision has proven controversial, with doctors cautioning that overreliance on biomarkers as a measure of efficacy can be misleading, as they may not always reflect improved patient outcomes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another government scheme hopes to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, while reducing the time and cost of developing these. At the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in February 2014, NIH director Francis S. Collins stated that 'Currently, we are investing too much money and time in avenues that don't pan out, while patients and their families wait'. Over the five years to 2019, this public−private partnership is developing up to five pilot projects for three common but difficult-to-treat diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 (adult onset) diabetes and the autoimmune disorders of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The partnership involves the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), as well as 10 major biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations like the Alzheimer's Association. The industrial partners are [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] (US), [[Biogen]] (US), [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (US), [[GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd|GlaxoSmithKline]] (UK), [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (US), Lilly (US), [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] (US), [[Pfizer]] (US), [[Sanofi]] (France) and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] (Japan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laboratories share samples, such as blood or brain tissue from deceased patients, to identify biomarkers. They also participate in NIH clinical trials. One critical component is that industry partners have agreed to make the data and analyses arising from the partnership accessible to the broad biomedical community. They will not use any discoveries to develop their own drug until these findings have been made public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2013, the government announced another public−private partnership, this time to implement its [[BRAIN Initiative|Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of this project is to leverage genetic, optical and imaging technologies to map individual neurons and complex circuits in the brain, eventually leading to a more complete understanding of this organ’s structure and function. By 2015, the BRAIN Initiative had ‘obtained commitments of over US$ 300 million in resources from federal agencies ([[National Institutes of Health]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], National Science Foundation, etc.), industry (National Photonics Initiative, [[General Electric]], [[Google]], GlaxoSmithKline, etc.) and philanthropy (foundations and universities)’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Precision Medicine Initiative]] has been another government priority. Defined as delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, precision medicine tailors treatments to patients based on their unique physiology, biochemistry and genetics. In his 2016 budget request, the president asked for US$215 million to be shared by the NIH, [[National Cancer Institute]] and FDA to fund the Precision Medicine Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research spending by biopharmaceutical companies ==

In 2013, US pharmaceutical companies spent $40 billion on R&amp;D inside the US and nearly another $11 billion on R&amp;D abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies increased their investment in precision medicine by roughly 75% and a further increase of 53% is projected by 2015. Between 12% and 50% of the products in their drug development pipelines are related to personalized medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer R&amp;D tax credits to particular industries and companies. Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years.  According to a survey by the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making décisions about investing in R&amp;D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tech CFOs don't really trust R&amp;D tax credit, survey says|last=Chasan|first=Emily|date=2012|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, six US biopharmaceutical companies figured in the global Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&amp;D. The following have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included for the first time in 2013 and Amazon in 2014, which is why the online store does not figure in the Top 50 for 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in venture capital investment ==
The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Total investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook|last=|first=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|year=2014|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers to relocate their headquarters overseas to gain a tax advantage, including Medtronic and Endo International. Pfizer's own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca aborted in 2014 after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in prescription drug prices ==
One policy concern for the [[Obama administration]] has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. From January 2008 to December 2014, the price of commonly used branded drugs increased by a little over 127%, even as the price of commonly prescribed generic drugs decreased by almost 63%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, spending on prescription drugs hit $374 billion. This increase in spending was fuelled by the costly new drugs on the market for treating hepatitis C ($11 billion), rather than by the millions of newly insured Americans under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 ($1 billion). About 31% of this spending went on specialty drug therapies to treat inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, oncology, hepatitis C and HIV, etc., and 6.4% on traditional therapies to treat diabetes, high cholesterol, pain, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, depression and so on’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fuelling the 'astronomic' rise in consumer prices for prescription drugs has been a new trend in the US, the acquisition of pharmaceuticals through licensing, purchase, a merger or acquisition. In the first half of 2014, the value of mergers and acquisitions by pharmaceutical companies totalled US$317.4 billion and, in the first quarter of 2015, the drug industry accounted for a little more than 45% of all US mergers and acquisitions. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. Pfizer’s own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company [[AstraZeneca|Astrazeneca]] aborted in 2014, after [[Pfizer]] admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bringing down the cost to consumers ==
The [[Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act)|Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]] was signed into law in March 2010 to encourage the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many biologic drugs will expire in the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the act was passed in 2010, the first biosimilar was only approved in the US by the FDA in 2015: Zarxio, made by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]]. Zarxio is a biosimilar of the cancer drug Neupogen, which boosts the patient’s white blood cells to ward off infection. In September 2015, a US court ruled that the Neupogen brand manufacturer Amgen could not block Zarxio from being sold in the US. Neupogen costs about US$3 000 per chemotherapy cycle; Zarxio hit the US market on 3 September 2015 at a 15% discount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Europe, the same drug had been approved as early as 2008 and has been safely marketed there ever since. The lag in development of an approval pathway in the US has been criticized for impeding access to biological therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The true cost savings from the use of biosimilars is difficult to assess. A 2014 study by the [[Rand Institute]] estimates a range of US$13–66 billion in savings over 2014–2024, depending upon the level of competition and FDA regulatory approval patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike generics, biosimilars cannot be approved on the basis of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove bioequivalence. Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Orphan drugs ==
Orphan diseases affect fewer than 200 000 Americans each year. Since the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] of 1983, over 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration (as of 2015), 260 alone in 2013. In 2014, sales of the top 10 [[Orphan drug|orphan drugs]] in the US amounted to US$18.32 billion; by 2020, orphan drugs sales worldwide are projected to account for 19% (US$ 28.16 billion) of the total US$ 176 billion in prescription drug spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, orphan drugs cost about 19.1 times more than non-orphan drugs (on an annual basis) in 2014, at an average annual cost per patient of US$ 137 782. Some are concerned that the incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs by the FDA’s orphan drug products programme is taking the companies’ attention away from developing drugs that will benefit more of the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Medical devices ==
There are more than 6500 medical device companies in the US, more than 80% of which have fewer than 50 employees. According to the [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], the market size of the medical device industry in the US is expected to reach US$ 133 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Observers foresee the further development and emergence of wearable health monitoring devices, telediagnosis and telemonitoring, robotics, biosensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing, new ''in vitro'' diagnostic tests and mobile apps that enable users to monitor their health and related behaviour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in pharmaceutical exports and patents ==
[[File:High-tech exports from the USA as a world share, 2008–2013.svg|thumb|High-tech exports from the United States of America as a world share, 2008-2013, data from Comtrade database, taken from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 5.10]]
Until 2010, the United States of America was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals. Since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods. The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Brachymeiosis''' was a hypothesized irregularity in the [[Ascomycota#Sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction of ascomycete fungi]], a variant of [[meiosis]] following an "extra" [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) step. The hypothesized process would have transformed four [[diploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] into eight [[haploid]] ones. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi.&lt;ref name="Carlile"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=03 | year=2005 | pages=129–131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the current understanding, [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]] reproduce by forming male and female organs ([[Antheridium|antheridia]]/spermatia and [[ascogonium|ascogonia]]), transferring [[haploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic [[ascus]] containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and [[mitosis]] to form eight haploid nuclei in the [[ascospore]]s.&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dube | first=H.C. | title=Introduction To Fungi, 3E | publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Limited | year=2009 | isbn=978-81-259-1433-4 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the botanist [[Robert Almer Harper|R.A. Harper]] reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed “brachymeiosis” in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser.&lt;ref name="Swingle"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Swingle | first=D.B. | title=Fertilization in ''Ascodesmis nigricans'' Van Tiegh| journal=American Journal of Botany | date=1934 | jstor=2436104 | volume=21 |pages=519–545 | doi=10.2307/2436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including some which had been believed to undergo brachymeiosis.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hirsch | first=Hilde E. | title=No Brachymeiosis in Pyronema Confluens | journal=Mycologia | volume=42 | issue=2 | year=1950 | page=301 | doi=10.2307/3755444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Olive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive |first=L.

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has recently been discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings, because of placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)&lt;ref name="Ross2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

===Humans===
* The Dutch sprinter [[Foekje Dillema]] was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in July 1950; later investigations revealed a Y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she probably was a 46,XX/46,XY mosaic female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ballantyne | first1 = KN | last2 = Kayser | first2 = M | last3 = Grootegoed | first3 = JA | year =2011 | title = 'Sex and gender issues in competitive sports: investigation of a historical case leads to a new viewpoint' | url = | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 46| issue = 8| pages = 614–7| doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2010.082552 | pmid=21540190 | pmc=3375582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In August 2003, researchers at the [[Shanghai Second Medical University]] in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and [[rabbit]] ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, then destroyed to harvest the resulting [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html| title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy| last=Mott| first=Maryann| date=January 25, 2005| work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, scientists at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |title=Iranian scientist creates sheep with half-human organs |date=27 Mar 2007 |work=[[Press TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210217/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc.

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J.

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst.

==Plants==

===Structure===
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal '''plant chimeras''' are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5LwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;dq=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38m0Tee4O8ns0gHR0JGWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' The plastids: their chemistry, structure, growth and inheritance''], 2nd edition,1978, Elsevier/ North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-80022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0JLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Mutation+breeding+techniques+and+behavior+of+irradiated+shoot+apices+of+potato&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=18q0TYacDajg0gGp9b31CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' Mutation breeding techniques and behavior of irradiated shoot apices of potato''], 1978, Pudoc, Wageingen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft chimeras===
{{Main|Graft-chimaera}}
[[File:Taxus-mosaic1.JPG|thumb| [[Taxus]] mosaic.]]
These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different [[cultivar]]s or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and legislation==
{{See also|Bioethics}}

===Ethics===
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions.

[[File:DirkvdM natural spiral.jpg|thumb|A natural left-handed helix, made by a certain climber plant's [[tendril]]. |171x171px]]
Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==

![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

A [[symmetry transformation]] between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]] transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called '''chiral symmetry'''.

[[Wu experiment|An experiment]] on the [[weak nuclear force|weak decay]] of [[cobalt]]-60 nuclei carried out by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] and collaborators in 1957 demonstrated that [[parity violation|parity is not a symmetry]] of the universe.

==Chirality and helicity==
{{see also|Helicity (particle physics)}}
The helicity of a particle is ''right-handed'' if the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]] is the same as the direction of its motion. It is ''left-handed'' if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [[clock]], with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, tossed with its face directed forwards, has left-handed helicity.

Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]]: “left” is negative, “right” is positive.

[[Image:Right left helicity.svg|center]]
The ''chirality'' of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the particle transforms in a right- or left-handed [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Note, however, that representations such as [[Dirac spinor]]s and others, have both right- and left-handed components. In cases like this, we can define [[projection operator]]s that project out either the right or left hand components and discuss the right- and left-handed portions of the representation.&lt;/ref&gt;

For massless particles – [[photon]]s, [[gluon]]s, and (hypothetical) [[graviton]]s – chirality is the same as [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]; a given massless particle appears to spin in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.

For massive particles – such as [[electron]]s, [[quark]]s, and [[neutrino]]s – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as “apparent chirality”) will be reversed.

A ''massless'' particle moves with the [[speed of light]], so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the [[speed of light]]) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of viewpoint ([[Lorentz boost]]) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a “''relativistic invariant''” (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particles' chirality.

The discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]] implies [[neutrino#Mass|that neutrinos have mass]], so the only observed massless particle is the [[photon]]. The [[gluon]] is also expected to be massless, although the assumption that it is has not been conclusively tested. Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only one of them has been confirmed by measurement. All other observed particles have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames. It is still possible that as-yet unobserved particles, like the [[graviton]], might be massless, and hence have invariant helicity that matches their chirality, like the [[photon]].

==Chiral theories==
Only left-handed [[fermion]]s and right-handed antifermions interact with the [[weak force|weak interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Povh, Klaus Rith, Christoph Scholz, Frank Zetsche, ''Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts'', (Springer 2006) p. 145, {{ISBN|978-3-540-36683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In most circumstances, two left-handed [[fermion]]s interact more strongly than right-handed or opposite-handed [[fermions]], implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality, which violates a symmetry of the other forces of nature.

Chirality for a [[Fermionic field#Dirac fields|Dirac fermion]]  {{mvar|ψ}} is defined through the operator [[Gamma matrices|{{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], which has [[eigenvalue, eigenvector, and eigenspace|eigenvalue]]s ±1.  
Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its left- or right-handed component by acting with the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]] {{math|½(1−''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} or {{math|½(1+''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} on {{mvar|ψ}}.

The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's [[parity (physics)|parity symmetry]] violation.

A common source of confusion is due to conflating this operator with the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another.  The resolution to this false paradox is that ''the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only'', for which helicity is not frame-dependent.  By contrast, for massive particles, ''chirality is not the same as helicity'', so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples the weak force in one frame, does so in every frame.

A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a ''chiral theory'', while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a ''vector theory''.  Many pieces of the [[Standard Model]] of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to  [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly cancellation]] in chiral theories.  [[Quantum chromodynamics]] is an example of a ''vector theory'', since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.

The [[electroweak theory]], developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a ''chiral theory''. Originally, it assumed that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos were massless]], and only assumed the existence of left-handed [[neutrino]]s (along with their complementary right-handed antineutrinos). After the observation of [[neutrino oscillation]]s, which imply that [[neutrino#Mass|neutrinos are massive]] like all other [[fermion]]s, the revised [[electroweak theory|theories of the electroweak interaction]] now include both right- and left-handed [[neutrino]]s.  However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.

The exact nature of the [[neutrino]] is still unsettled and so the [[electroweak theory|electroweak theories]] that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of [[neutrino]]s in the same way as was already done for all other [[fermions]].

==Chiral symmetry==
Vector [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] with massless Dirac fermion fields  {{mvar|ψ}}  exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow e^{i\theta_L}\psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow \psi_R&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L\rightarrow \psi_L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\psi_R\rightarrow e^{i\theta_R}\psi_R.&lt;/math&gt;

With {{mvar|N}} [[Flavor (particle physics)|flavors]], we have unitary rotations instead: {{math|''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;times;U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

More generally, we write the right-handed and left-handed states as a projection operator acting on a spinor. The right-handed and left-handed projection operators are
:&lt;math&gt; P_R = \frac{1 + \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma^5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry, as the mass term in the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]],    {{math|  ''m''{{overset|&amp;mdash;|''ψ''}}''ψ''}},  breaks chiral symmetry explicitly.

[[Chiral symmetry breaking|Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking]] may also occur in some theories, as it most notably does in [[quantum chromodynamics]].

The chiral symmetry transformation can be divided into a component that treats the left-handed and the right-handed parts equally, known as '''vector symmetry''', and a component that actually treats them differently, known as '''axial symmetry'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ta-Pei Cheng and Ling-Fong Li, ''Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics'',  (Oxford 1984) {{ISBN|978-0198519614}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Current algebra]].) A scalar field model encoding chiral symmetry and its [[chiral symmetry breaking|breaking]] is the [[chiral model]].

The most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.

The general principle is often referred to by the name '''chiral symmetry'''. The rule is absolutely valid in the [[classical mechanics]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], but results from [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral [[subatomic particles]].

===Example: ''u'' and ''d'' quarks in QCD===
Consider [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) with two ''massless'' [[quarks]] {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|d}} (massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry). The Lagrangian reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u + \overline{d}\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, d + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of left-handed and right-handed spinors, it reads
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{u}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_L + \overline{u}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,u_R + \overline{d}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_L  + \overline{d}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,d_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, {{mvar|i}} is the imaginary unit and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\not}D&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac operator]].)

Defining
:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} u \\ d \end{bmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;
it can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \overline{q}_L\,i\displaystyle{\not}D \,q_L + \overline{q}_R\,i\displaystyle{\not}D\, q_R + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{gluons} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is unchanged under a rotation of ''q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix  {{mvar|L}}, and ''q&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' by any 2×2 unitary matrix {{mvar|R}}.

This symmetry of the Lagrangian is called ''flavor chiral symmetry'', and denoted as {{math|''U(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.   It decomposes into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The singlet vector symmetry, {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}},  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and corresponds to [[baryon number]] conservation.

The singlet axial group  {{math|''U(1)&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  acts as
:&lt;math&gt;
q_L \rightarrow e^{i\theta} q_L \qquad
q_R \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} q_R ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
and it does not correspond to a conserved quantity, because it is explicitly violated by a [[anomaly (physics)|quantum anomaly]].

The remaining chiral symmetry {{math|''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}} turns out to be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] by a [[quark condensate]] 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \langle \bar{q}^a_R q^b_L \rangle = v \delta^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, 
into the diagonal vector subgroup ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' known as [[isospin]]. The [[Goldstone bosons]] corresponding to the three broken generators are the three [[pions]]. 
As a consequence, the effective theory of QCD bound states like the baryons, must now include mass terms for them, ostensibly disallowed by unbroken chiral symmetry. Thus, this [[chiral symmetry breaking]] induces the bulk of hadron masses, such as those for the [[nucleon]]s &amp;mdash; in effect, the bulk of the mass of all visible matter.

In the real world, because of the nonvanishing and differing masses of the quarks,  ''SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is only an approximate symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gell-Mann | first1 = M. | last2 = Renner | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.175.2195 | title = Behavior of Current Divergences under SU_{3}×SU_{3} | journal = Physical Review | volume = 175 | issue = 5 | pages = 2195 | year = 1968 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1968PhRv..175.2195G }}&lt;/ref&gt; to begin with, and therefore the pions are not massless, but have small masses: they are [[Chiral symmetry breaking|pseudo-Goldstone boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Peskin |first1=Michael |last2=Schroeder |first2=Daniel | title = An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory | publisher = Westview Press | year = 1995 | pages = 670 | isbn = 0-201-50397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More Flavors===
For more  "light" quark species, {{mvar|N}}  [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]  in general, the corresponding chiral symmetries are ''U(N)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;×U(N)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'',  decomposing into
:&lt;math&gt;SU(N)_L \times SU(N)_R \times U(1)_V \times U(1)_A ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and exhibiting a very analogous [[chiral symmetry breaking]] pattern.

Most usually, {{mvar|N}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is taken, the ''u, d'', and ''s'' quarks taken to be light (the [[Eightfold way (physics)]]), so then approximately massless for the symmetry to be meaningful to a lowest order, while the other three quarks are sufficiently heavy to barely have a residual chiral symmetry be visible for practical purposes.

===An application in Particle Physics===
In [[theoretical physics]], the [[electroweak]] model breaks [[parity (physics)|parity]] maximally. All its [[fermion]]s are chiral [[Weyl fermion]]s, which means that the charged [[W and Z bosons|weak gauge bosons]] only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons. (Note that the neutral electroweak Z boson couples to left ''and'' right-handed fermions.)

Some theorists found this objectionable, and so conjectured a [[Grand unification theory|GUT]] extension of the [[weak force]] which has new, high energy [[W' and Z' bosons]], which now couple with right handed quarks and leptons:
:&lt;math&gt;{[SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y]\over \mathbb{Z}_2}&lt;/math&gt;
to
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (pronounced SU(2) left) is none other than the above SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, while  [[B−L]] is the [[baryon number]] minus the [[lepton number]]. The electric charge formula in this model is given by
:&lt;math&gt; Q= I_{3L}+I_{3R}+\frac{B-L}{2}&lt;/math&gt;;
where &lt;math&gt;\! I_{3L,R}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[weak isospin]] values of the fields in the theory.

There is also the [[chromodynamic]] SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The idea was to restore parity by introducing a '''left-right symmetry'''. This is a [[group extension]] of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the left-right symmetry) by
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6}&lt;/math&gt;
to the [[semidirect product]]
:&lt;math&gt;{SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}\over \mathbb{Z}_6} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

This has two [[connected space|connected component]]s where '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an [[automorphism]], which is the composition of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[outer automorphism]] of SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; with the interchange of the left and right copies of SU(2) with the reversal of U(1)&lt;sub&gt;B−L&lt;/sub&gt;. It was shown by Rabindra N. Mohapatra and [[Goran Senjanovic]] in 1975 that [[left-right symmetry]] can be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam and it also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the [[seesaw mechanism]].

In this setting, the chiral [[quark]]s
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}&lt;/math&gt;
are unified into an [[irreducible representation]] (“irrep”)
:&lt;math&gt;(3,2,1)_{1\over 3}\oplus(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[lepton]]s are also unified into an [[irreducible representation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(1,2,1)_{-1}\oplus(1,1,2)_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model
are
:&lt;math&gt;(1,3,1)_{2}\oplus(1,1,3)_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This then predicts three [[sterile neutrino]]s, which is perfectly consistent with {{As of|2005|alt=current}} [[neutrino oscillation]] data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.

Because the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left-right models predict [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s.
This left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the [[Pati–Salam model]] (1974), Mohapatra–Pati models (1975).

'''''Creatures 3''''' is the third game in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' [[artificial life|a-life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]]. In this installment, the [[Shee (Creatures)|Shee]] have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order.

There are 6 main "[[Closed ecological system|metarooms]]" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The [[Norn (Creatures)|Norn]] Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the [[Grendel]] mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the [[Ettin (Creatures)|Ettin]] mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world.

Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original ''Creatures'' Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in ''[[Creatures 2]]'', love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert.

Creatures 3 runs on the CAOS engine, making it highly moddable, but now it is retired and outdated.

'''Critterding''' is an artificial life simulator created by Bob Winckelmans and released as open source under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

== Simulation ==
Critterding is a 3D/Physics based simulator, in which critters try to survive by developing a form of locomotion, find food and reproduce. Critters are made up of two types of body parts which are linked together by joints. The head, coloured red, is where the vision and mouth is located. The body segments are used for locomotion and display the colour of the critter. On an initial run, random seed critters are generated in a food rich environment, eventually a seed critter is generated that is able to eat and reproduce before dying. The new offspring have a chance to receive a mutation to either the body or neural network, some of which will be detrimental, causing the critter to fail and die while other mutations will be beneficial allowing it and its offspring to flourish over their siblings. Once the critter population reaches a preset maximum, the population is halved and the available food in the system is slightly reduced.

== Vision ==
Critters see with a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid is able to see red, green, blue and alpha channels.

== Environment ==
Critterding supports 2 main environment types. A tray/petri dish style flatworld with walls to keep critters from falling into the void and the roundworld environment where critters and food are held on with planet like gravity. Beta 14 introduces .obj loading for fully customisable terrain, critter and food skins, skydome and dynamic lighting.

A '''dead pool''', also known as a '''death pool''', is a game of prediction which involves guessing when someone will die. Sometimes it is a bet where money is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2004-07-06-pop-candy_x.htm |title=Celebrity obsession extends beyond the grave |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Whitney |last=Matheson |agency=Pop Candy (column) |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern application ==
In the early 20th century, death pools were popular in dangerous sports such as motorsport, for example the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first edition]] of the [[Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20110527/SPORTS0107/105270322/Even-first-Indy-500-race-spectacle |title=Even the first Indy 500 race was a spectacle |publisher=Indianapolis Star |first=Phillip B |last=Wilson |date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variants ===
A typical modern dead pool might have players pick out celebrities who they think will die within the year. Most games start on January 1 and run for 12 months, although there are some variations on game length and timing.{{cn|date=January 2014}} 

In 2000, website [[Fucked Company]] claimed to be a "dot-com dead pool" which invited users to predict the next [[dot-com bubble|Internet startups]] to fail during that era's [[dot com bust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Festa|first=Paul |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-955447.html?hhTest=1 |title=Dot-com dead pool brakes for Ford |work=CNet News |date=2002-08-26|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site itself folded in 2007 after a long history as a target for [[strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation]] by companies.&lt;ref name="rowan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4064822,00.html|last=Rowan|first=David|title=The dead list|date=17 September 2000 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in contemporary society ===
The ''[[Rotten.com]] Dead Pool'', the largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.macleans.ca/canada/features/article.jsp?content=20080201_143436_5540|title = Who's in your celebrity dead pool?|first = Kathleen|last = Kennedy|publisher = Maclean|date = February 1, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140112063126/http://www.macleans.ca/canada/features/article.jsp?content=20080201_143436_5540|archivedate = 12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[NNDB]] as its source of qualified celebrities, and as arbiter of their life status. 

The concept and success strategies are also detailed in a (previously) annual guide called ''The Dead Pool,'' written by [[KQRS-FM]] radio personality Mike Gelfand and author Mike Wilkinson. KQRS-FM in [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], Minnesota also does an annual on air dead pool contest, where show hosts and listeners will attempt to pick which celebrity will die in that calendar year.

In his AP news article "Some say death pools are in poor taste"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061229/NEWS/612290302 |title=Some say death pools are in poor taste |publisher=Herald Tribune |first=Matt |last=Sedensky |date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which brought national attention to ''The Old Blue Eyes Celebrity Death Watch''), author Matt Sedensky writes, "Players scour newspapers and Web sites for news on celebrities' health; they rely on tips from insiders; and they consider a public figure's lifestyle, absence of recent appearances and rumors of illness".

==In popular culture==
A dead pool is a key plot element of the 1988 final installment of the ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' film series, ''[[The Dead Pool]]''. Harry investigates the players, when several people listed in a game of dead pool die in suspicious circumstances.

The [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool]] takes his name after escaping from [[Ajax (comics)|Ajax]] and [[List of Weapon X members|Dr. Killebrew]], who formed their own dead pool based on which of their experimental subjects would die first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truffaut-Wong|first1=Olivia|title=How Did 'Deadpool' Get His Name? The Answer Is Way More Obvious Than You'd Think|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/140676-how-did-deadpool-get-his-name-the-answer-is-way-more-obvious-than-youd-think|website=Bustle|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', the character takes his name from a dead pool of mercenaries, himself included, who are regular patrons at his favorite bar.

In the [[MTV]] show ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', the main plotline of [[Teen Wolf (season 4)|Season 4]] revolves around a dead pool specifically targeting the supernaturals of [[Beacon Hills]], which is set up by a mysterious character named The Benefactor.

The '''death-positive movement''' is a [[Social movement|social]] and [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]] movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in [[End-of-life care|end of life care]] options available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkdeath.com/death-positive-movement/|title=What is the Death Positive Movement?|date=2015-06-09|work=TalkDeath|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The word death positivity was popularized{{Dubious|date=March 2018}} by [[Caitlin Doughty]] as a play on the term [[Sex-positive movement|sex positivity]]. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/resources/death-positive-movement|title=Death Positive Movement - The Order of the Good Death|work=The Order of the Good Death|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Order of the Good Death]] website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/death-positive|title=Death Positive|last=|first=|date=|website=The Order of the Good Death|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/27/caitlin-doughty-death-positivity|title=Welcome the reaper: Caitlin Doughty and the 'death-positivity' movement|last=Kelly|first=Kim|date=2017-10-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/death-positivity-movement/slide/2|title=5 Stunning Pieces Of Art That Prove Death Doesn't Have To Be Sad|date=2018-02-08|work=Women's Health|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death anxiety''' is [[anxiety]] caused by thoughts of [[death]]. One source defines death anxiety as a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to [[being|'be']]".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url= http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title= How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors= Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal= Open Nurs J. |year= 2013 |volume= 7 |pages= 14–21 |doi= 10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid= 23400515 |pmc= 3565229 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate= 2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as '''thanatophobia''' (fear of death), death anxiety is distinguished from [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of dead or dying people and/or things (i.e., fear of others who are dead or dying, not of one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is anxiety caused by death-recent  [[Mental status examination#Thought content|thought-content]],&lt;ref&gt;H.

Death anxiety can cause extreme timidness with a person's attitude towards discussing [[organ donation]] and anything to do with death.&lt;ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Robert Langs]] distinguishes three types of death anxiety:&lt;ref name=escp&gt;http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predatory death anxiety ===
Predatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Langs, R. Three Forms of Death Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most basic and oldest&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p615&lt;/ref&gt; form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first [[unicellular organism]]s’ set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self-protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger.&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p616&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p617&lt;/ref&gt; These traumas may be physical, psychological, or both.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt; Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a [[fight-or-flight response]]: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt;

=== Predation or predator death anxiety ===
Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald.Hilgendorf. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950021 Death imagery and death anxiety.] Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential death anxiety ===
Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p10&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="langs"/&gt; Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p11&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p13&lt;/ref&gt; In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"/&gt; Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p14&lt;/ref&gt; These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"/&gt;

== Theories==

===Thanatophobia===

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald&gt;http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===

Developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as "[[ego integrity]]". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{main|Terror management theory}}
[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Emanuele. (2011). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x/abstract Ideology, Fear of Death, and Death Anxiety] 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and adjustment hypotheses===
{{main|Death and adjustment hypotheses}}
[[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] postulated the [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Being, time and Dasein===

[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning management theory===

[[Paul T. P. Wong]]'s work on the meaning management theory&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2008). Meaning-management theory and death acceptance. In A. Tomer, G. T. Eliason, &amp; P. T. P. Wong (Eds.), ''Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes'' (pp. 65-87). New York, NY: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic.&lt;ref name=concepts/&gt; His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Gesser, G., Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Reker, G. T. (1987-88). Death attitudes across the life span. The development and validation of the Death Attitude Profile (DAP). ''Omega, 2'', 113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death (DAP-R). In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed.), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.

===Other theories===

Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p570"&gt;Langs." Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570&lt;/ref&gt; The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. "Psychology" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the ''regret theory'' which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"&gt;Langs. [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/prev.90.4.565.23914?journalCode=prev Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety.] The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p575&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt; The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;  Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;

===Personal meanings of death===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D.

If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cicirelli |first=Victor G. |date=November 1998 |title=Personal meanings of death in relation to fear of death |journal=[[Death Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=713–733 |doi=10.1080/074811898201236 |pmid=10346699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiosity's effect===

The thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.

A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = L. | last2 = Wahab | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Ratnasingan | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1080/13674676.2011.652606 | title = Religiosity and fear of death: A three‐nation comparison | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 179 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Wen, Y. (2010). Religiosity and death anxiety. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 6(2), 31-37. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/867401301&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety,&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. The Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 12 (4), 525-535. Retrieved from http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/13591045/v12i0004/525_duafodiyc&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt; There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525–535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;

A study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 12 (4) pg 525-535&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between adult attachment and death anxiety ==
There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexes ==
The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.  Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.&lt;ref name="Harrawood, L. K. 2008"&gt;Harrawood, L. K., White, L. J., &amp; Benshoff, J. J. (2008). Death Anxiety in a National Sample of United States Funeral Directors and Its Relationship with Death Exposure, Age, and Sex. Omega: Journal of Death &amp; Dying, 58(2), 129-146. {{DOI|10.2190/OM.58.2.c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew.Dawson."Death anexiety:State or Trait" Journal od Clinical Psychology.1979.pg158&lt;/ref&gt; Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"&gt;Donald.Charles. "Death Anxiety and Mental Ability" Essence: Issues in the Study of Ageing, Dying and Death. 1979.p85&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"&gt;Langs. "Death Anxiety and the Emotion-processing Mind" Psychoanalytic Psychology .2004.p43&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt; Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt;

==Age ==
It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent.  However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek &amp; Trenner, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skill|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring death anxiety ==

There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"&gt;Tomer.Eliason."Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety" Death Stuides.1996.p353&lt;/ref&gt; Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;
The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
A '''digital organism''' is a [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[computer program]] that [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutates]] and [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolves]].  Digital [[organism]]s are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian [[evolution]], and to test or verify specific hypotheses or [[mathematical model]]s of evolution.  The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of [[artificial life]].

== History ==
Digital organisms can be traced back to the game [[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]], developed in 1961 at Bell Labs, in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from [[Execution (computing)|executing]] .&lt;ref&gt;Aleph-Null, "Computer Recreations", Software: Practice and Experience, vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–96, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A similar implementation that followed this was the game [[Core War]]. In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning [[strategy|strategies]] was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all [[resource (computer science)|computational resources]].  Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated "memory" in which the game took place.  This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), "enslaved processes" (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves.

[[Steen Rasmussen]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the [[programming language]] in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program.

The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was [[Thomas S. Ray]] with his [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way.

Later, [[Chris Adami]], Titus Brown, and [[Charles Ofria]] started developing their [[Avida]] system,&lt;ref&gt;http://avida.devosoft.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same [[address space]] and could potentially overwrite or otherwise interfere with each other. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists.  Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lenski]] of [[Michigan State University]] has used Avida extensively in his work.  Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (USA).

In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called ''Amoeba'' that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition.

The '''Dorian Gray syndrome''' ('''DGS''') denotes a cultural and societal [[phenomenon]] characterized by a man's extreme [[pride]] in his personal appearance and the fitness of his physique, which is accompanied by difficulties in coping with the requirements of psychological maturation and with the [[aging]] of his body.

The DGS is characterized by a triad of symptoms that overlap, and so combine [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] signs of [[dysmorphophobia]], [[narcissistic]] character traits, and the immaturity of arrested development, which often are found in [[paraphilias]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Gieler et al. eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve ephemeral youth, the man afflicted with DGS tends to consume cosmetic products and services, hair-restoration procedures, anti-impotence drugs, and [[cosmetic surgery]]; hence, he might resist the [[psychosomatic]] and [[psychodynamic]] explanations of the [[syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 47 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Dorian Gray syndrome" refers to the protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), an exceptionally handsome man whose [[hedonism]] and [[Narcissism|excessive self-love]] proved detrimental to the personal, social, and emotional aspects of his life, and who sought to escape the ravages of time and his own decadent lifestyle by having a supernatural portrait of himself age in his place.

==History==
[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The portraitist Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton observe the beauty recorded in the picture of Dorian Gray.]]
The DGS was first described in ''The Dorian Gray Syndrome: Psychodynamic Need for Hair growth Restorers and other "fountains of youth"'' (2001), in a symposium about the unrealistic male pursuit of bodily [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]] — by means of lifestyle-enhancing drugs, aesthetic surgery, and psychotropic medicines — and its consequences for his mental health as a social being.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig 2000, Brosig ''et al.'' 2001, Euler 2003 ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The culturally descriptive name of the syndrome refers to the eponymous protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), by Oscar Wilde, the story of a very handsome young man who much admires and envies the just-completed portrait of himself, and wishes that it would grow old, rather than he. In order to resist the physical corruptions of time and nature, and unable and unwilling to mature, Dorian Gray "gives his soul away", and his wish is granted.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil portrait and the narrative of the novel transgress and cite [[narcissistic]] mirror motives; as such, eternal beauty, aging, and maturation are represented with the psychological dyad of "the person and the mirror". The personal character of the man Dorian Gray is the background for the clinical description of the Dorian Gray [[syndrome]] that afflicts the patient.

==Causes==
The Dorian Gray syndrome arises from the concurring and overlapping clinical concepts of the [[narcissistic personality]], [[dysmorphophobia]], and [[Paraphilias|paraphilia]]. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamically]], the man afflicted with DGS presents an interplay among his narcissistic tendencies ("timeless beauty"), his arrested development (inability to psychologically mature), and his use of "medical lifestyle" products and services — hair restoration, drugs (for [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], weight-loss, and mood modification), laser dermatology, and plastic surgery — in order to remain young.

Although the DGS patient displays diagnostic features of said mental disorders, the syndrome describes a common, underlying psychodynamics of mental illness, which is characterized by [[narcissistic defences]] against time-dependent maturation, expressed by actively seeking the timeless beauty of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boese, ''Hippo Eats Dwarf'' (2010) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The article ''Das Dorian Gray syndrom'' (2005) reported that approximately 3.0 per cent of the population of Germany present features of the Dorian Gray syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig, B., Euler, S., Brähler, E., Gieler, U. (2005) "Das Dorian Gray Syndrom", in Trüeb, R. A. (Hg.): Smart aging. Darmstadt, Steinkopff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for Dorian Gray syndrome are:
* Signs of [[dysmorphophobia]]
* Arrested development (inability to mature)
* Using at least two different medical-lifestyle products and services:
** Hair-growth restoration (e.g. [[Antiandrogen|finasteride]])
** Antiadiposita to lose weight (e.g. [[orlistat]])
** [[Erectile Dysfunction|Anti-impotence drugs]]  (e.g. [[sildenafil]])
** Anti-depressant drugs (e.g. [[fluoxetine]])
** [[Cosmetology|Cosmetic]] [[dermatology]] (e.g. laser resurfacing)
** [[Cosmetic surgery]] (e.g. a face-lift, [[liposuction]])

==Sequelae==
Episodes of [[major depressive disorder]] and of [[suicidal]] [[crisis]] occur in the man afflicted with Dorian Gray syndrome when the [[defense mechanism]] activities, the pursuit of eternal youth, fail to indefinitely preserve his handsome face and sculpted physique; usually, anti-depressant drugs and psychotherapy are prescribed and applied to counter his feelings of failure.&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, if the man misunderstands the self-defensive character of "acting out" the DGS, and continues pursuing the timeless beauty of male youth, without being aware of the psychodynamics of narcissism, then he, as a psychiatric patient, establishes a cycle of chronic [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]]. In extreme cases of DGS, the man seeks self-destruction, by means either of [[Medication|drugs]] or with plastic surgery, or both, in order to fill the narcissistic emptiness that is the Dorian Gray syndrome.

==Analogous applications==
* In sport, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to ageing baseball players who retain their competitive edge (athleticism) with drugs that are illegal in professional sport.&lt;ref&gt;V. A Belton, ''Baseball is America'' (2010) p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In architecture, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to the rehabilitation of a building to a pristine condition greater than when the building was new.&lt;ref&gt;M. Glendinning, ''The Conservation Movement'' (2013) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

====Related philosophical issues====

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact.... Moral judgments ... must be ''a priori'' judgments."&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Oct 29, 2010 |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|quote=Philosophers who distinguish ''freedom of action'' and ''freedom of will'' do so because our success in carrying out our ends depends in part on factors wholly beyond our control. Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Free Will: Essential Readings from the Contemporary Debates |author1=Paul Russell |author2=Oisin Deery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLyi7nmzr28C&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=I. The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion.

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]]. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere, thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will.&lt;ref name=Scepkowski&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1534582303260119 | last1 = Scepkowski | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Cronin-Golomb | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = The alien hand: cases, categorizations, and anatomical correlates | url = | journal = Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 261–77 | pmid = 15006289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bundick&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.68.1.83 | last1 = Bundick | first1 = T. | last2 = Spinella | first2 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Subjective experience, involuntary movement, and posterior alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 83–85 | pmid = 10601408 | pmc = 1760620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.''

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren.

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William.

Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], a '''hermaphrodite''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɜr|ˈ|m|æ|f|r|ə|d|aɪ|t}}) is an organism that has complete or partial [[reproductive organs]] and produces [[gametes]] normally associated with both male and female [[sexes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermaphrodite Merriam-Webster Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807134545/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermaphrodite |date=2011-08-07 }} Retrieved 28 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] groups of animals (mostly [[invertebrates]]) do not have separate sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphroditism| title=hermaphroditism| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]| accessdate=9 April 2013| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308104232/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphroditism| archivedate=8 March 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of [[sexual reproduction]] in which either partner can act as the "female" or "male." For example, the great majority of [[tunicata|tunicates]], [[pulmonate]] snails, [[opisthobranch]] [[snails]], [[earthworms]] and [[slug]]s are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other [[vertebrates]]. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.

Historically, the term ''hermaphrodite'' has also been used to describe [[ambiguous genitalia]] and [[gonadal mosaicism]] in individuals of [[gonochoristic]] species, especially human beings. The word ''[[intersex]]'' has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word ''hermaphrodite'' is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,&lt;ref name=Dreger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreger|first1=Alice Domurat|title=Intersex in the age of ethics|date=1999|publisher=Univ.

A rough estimate of the number of hermaphroditic animal species is 65,000.&lt;ref name="pmid17089966"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jarne P, Auld JR |title=Animals mix it up too: the distribution of self-fertilization among hermaphroditic animals |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1816–24 | date=September 2006 |pmid=17089966 |doi= 10.1554/06-246.1|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1653/024.097.0223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the estimated total number of animal species is 8.6 million, the percentage of animal species that are hermaphroditic is about 0.7%. Arthropods are the [[phylum]] with the largest number of species.  Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self-fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals is similar to that of plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants.&lt;ref name="pmid17089966" /&gt;

According to [[Ovid]], he fused with the [[nymph]] [[Salmacis]] resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of male and female sexes;&lt;ref name="Ovid"&gt;[[s:Metamorphoses/Book IV#The Story of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus|Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV: The story of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis.]]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the earlier [[Diodorus Siculus]], he was born with a physical body combining male and female sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#6.5|title=LacusCurtius • Diodorus Siculus — Book&amp;nbsp;IV Chapters&amp;nbsp;1‑7|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''hermaphrodite'' entered the [[English lexicon]] as early as the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st edn, s.v.

Sequential hermaphrodites ([[dichogamy]]) occur in [[species]] in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=barrows&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal behavior desk reference: a dictionary of animal behavior, ecology, and evolution |last=Barrows |first=Edward M.|authorlink= |edition=2nd |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |location= Boca Raton, Fla|isbn=978-0-8493-2005-7|oclc=299866547 |page= 317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female genitalia.

Ghiselin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghiselin|first=Michael T.|title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1969|volume=44|pages=189–208|doi=10.1086/406066|pmid=4901396|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex.

Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories:
* '''Protandry''': Where an organism is born as a male, and then changes sex to a female.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
** Example: The [[clownfish]] (genus ''[[Amphiprion]]'') are colorful reef fish found living in [[symbiosis]] with [[sea anemone]]s. Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].
* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.
*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt;
**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660–1668.|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]]. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the [[broodstock]] are extremely valuable individuals.

===Simultaneous hermaphrodites===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gnathostomulid]] --&gt;
&lt;!--"Simultaneous hermaphrodite" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|[[Turbellaria]]ns mating by [[penis fencing]]. Each has two penises on the undersides of their heads which they use to inject sperm.]][[File:Mating earthworms.jpg|Mating Earthworms|thumb|[[Earthworm]]s are simultaneous hermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs.]]
A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time.&lt;ref name=barrows/&gt; [[Self-fertilization]] often occurs.
* [[Reproductive system of gastropods]]: [[Pulmonate]] [[land snail]]s and land [[slug]]s are perhaps the best-known kind of simultaneous hermaphrodite, and are the most widespread of terrestrial animals possessing this sexual polymorphism. Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via [[spermatophore]], which can then be stored in the [[spermatheca]]. After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.
*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.
* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.

* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.
* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.
* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="pmid16005289"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barrière A, Félix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

* The mangrove killifish (''[[Mangrove rivulus|Kryptolebias marmoratus]]'') is a species of fish that lives along the east coast of North, Central and South America. These fish are simultaneous hermaphrodites. ''K. marmoratus'' produces eggs and sperm by meiosis and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization. Each individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish's body.&lt;ref&gt;Sakakura, Y., Soyano, K., Noakes, D.L.G. &amp; Hagiwara, A.

===Pseudohermaphroditism===
{{main|Pseudohermaphroditism}}
When [[spotted hyena]]s were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The [[Spotted hyena#Female genitalia|apparent penis in female spotted hyenas]] is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html|title=The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119124756/http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html|archivedate=2012-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/716.php|title=Hyena Graphic|website=EurekAlert!|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310230213/http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/716.php|archivedate=2011-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until [[sexual maturity]], when they may become pregnant.

Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], outwardly appear completely female or male, frequently without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis.

Some humans were historically termed [[true hermaphroditism|true hermaphrodites]] if their [[gonad]]al tissue contained both testicular and ovarian tissue, or [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphrodites]] if their external appearance ([[phenotype]]) differed from sex expected from internal gonads. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice D.|last2=Chase|first2=Cheryl|last3=Sousa|first3=Aron|last4=Gruppuso|first4=Phillip A.|last5=Frader|first5=Joel|date=18 August 2005|title="Changing the Nomenclature/Taxonomy for Intersex: A Scientific and Clinical Rationale."|url=http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=27 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154642/http://www.aissg.org/PDFs/Dreger-Nomenclature-2005.PDF|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics.

Intersex is in some caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes. One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s). Thus, [[testicular]] and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Hermaphrodite''' is used in [[botany]] to describe a [[flower]] that has both [[stamen|staminate]] (male, pollen-producing) and [[carpel]]late (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual—such plants are called [[monoecious]]. Monoecy is especially common in [[Pinophyta|conifers]], but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Molnar|first=Sebastian|title= Plant Reproductive Systems|url= http://www.geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|date= 17 February 2004|work= Evolution and the Origins of Life|publisher= Geocities.com|accessdate=12 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022174814/http://geocities.com/we_evolve/Plants/breeding_sys.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition also occurs in some algae.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, L. 1931 ''A Handbook of the British Seaweeds.''

'''''How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life''''' is a 2012 popular [[economics]] book by [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]] and Edward Skidelsky. It was published initially by [[Other Press]] and later by [[Penguin Books]].

The book asks why Westerners work so many hours per week and lead lives that revolve around money, business and financial decisions in defiance of [[John Maynard Keynes]]' 1930 assertion&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University]] http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that there would come a time (around 2015) when [[capitalism]] would be able to provide for all our needs and the work week would drop to 10 or even 5 hours.

The book (and Edward Skidelsky's writing generally&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/23/consumerism-good-life-economic-system&lt;/ref&gt;) looks into the idea of [[Eudaimonia|the good life]] and how capitalism may have been the key to it, but we have now lost sense of the good life as a priority.

The solutions offered to this problem are to "curb insatiability" and to consider a form of [[basic income]] for society.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Escapologist]] http://newescapologist.co.uk/2012/12/06/how-much-is-enough/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"The over-all thrust of their polemic is a welcome call to reinvigorate society's ethical aspect and bring about the good life for everyone." —''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Yorker]] http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2012/08/13/120813crbn_brieflynoted1&lt;/ref&gt;

"How Much Is Enough? is a delightful book. It addresses a Big Question without the jargon and obfuscation that pollutes so much philosophy. The prose is lucid, and all the relevant issues are raised and addressed." —''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444450004578002083763099910&lt;/ref&gt;

"The authors turn to historical fiction, philosophy, and political theory, drawing on Faust, Marx's critique of capitalism, and Aristotle's uses of wealth. Their conclusion that concepts like respect, friendship, and community are more likely to contribute to satisfaction and overall happiness than wealth makes for a fascinating, if cerebral, read."  —''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59051-507-5&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Skidelskys move seamlessly from the abstract to the concrete; from philosophy to public policy." —''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Independent https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-the-week-how-much-is-enough-the-love-of-money-and-the-case-for-the-good-life-by-robert-skidelsky--edward-skidelsky-7917722.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', disagreed with both the book's concept of leisure and its proposition that more leisure time would lead to overall personal betterment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Working 9 to 12 ‘How Much Is Enough?’ by Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/how-much-is-enough-by-robert-skidelsky-and-edward-skidelsky.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=NY Times|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''human condition''' is "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of [[human]] existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality".&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:human condition|human condition]]" entry at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very broad topic which has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

As a [[terminology|literary term]], "the human condition" is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects such as the [[meaning of life]] or [[morality|moral concerns]].&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://learn.lexiconic.net/humancondition.htm The human condition in literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some perspectives==

Each [[major religious groups|major religion]] has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, [[Buddhism]] [[Four Noble Truths|teaches]] that life is a perpetual cycle of [[dukkha|suffering]], death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] teaches that humans are born in a [[original sin|sinful condition]] and are [[Christian views on hell|doomed]] in the [[afterlife]] unless they receive [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in which [[Plato]] explored the question "what is justice?" and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of [[society]] as a whole, prompting him to devise a [[utopia]]. Two thousand years later [[René Descartes]] declared "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of [[reason]], to be the primary determiner of [[truth]]; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA511 ''History of Western Philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt; One such modern school, [[existentialism]], attempts to reconcile an individual's sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be [[absurdism|absurd]].

Many works of literature provide perspective on the human condition.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt; One famous example is [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] monologue "[[All the world's a stage]]" that pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and the notion of [[identity crisis]]. It also has various methods, e.g. the [[logotherapy]] developed by [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] to discover and affirm human meaning. Another method, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], has become a widespread treatment for [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driessen Ellen |author2=Hollon Steven D | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Mood Disorders: Efficacy, Moderators and Mediators | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 537–55 | doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.005 | pmid=20599132 | pmc=2933381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the biological [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]] has been significant. The theory posits that the human [[species]] is related to all others, living and extinct, and that [[natural selection]] is the primary survival factor. This has provided a basis for new beliefs, e.g. [[social Darwinism]], and for new [[technology]], e.g. [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladki A, Kaczanowski S, Szczesny P, Zielenkiewicz P |title=The evolutionary rate of antibacterial drug targets |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=14 |pages=36 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23374913 |url= |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-36 |pmc=3598507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==

Notable uses of the term "the human condition" include  [[André Malraux]]'s novel ''[[Man's Fate]]'', [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La Condition Humaine]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]]'s [[The Human Condition (book)|political philosophy]], and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s [[The Human Condition (film series)|film trilogy]].

[[File:Cuerpo Incorrupto de La Siervita de Dios.jpg|thumb|400px|The body of [[Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado]], Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena found to be incorrupt by the Catholic Church ([[Tenerife]], [[Spain]]).]]
'''Incorruptibility''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies (specifically [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|beati]]) to avoid the normal process of [[decomposition]] after death as a sign of their holiness. Bodies that undergo little or no decomposition, or delayed decomposition, are sometimes referred to as ''incorrupt'' or ''incorruptible''.

Incorruptibility is thought to occur even in the presence of factors which normally hasten decomposition, as in the cases of saints [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Julie Billiart]] and [[Francis Xavier]].&lt;ref name="Quigley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Quigley| first = Christine| title =The Corpse: A History| publisher = McFarland| year = 2005| page = 254| isbn =978-0786424498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholicism==
In [[Roman Catholicism]], if a body is judged as incorruptible after death, this is generally seen as a sign that the individual is a [[saint]]. [[Canon law]] allows inspection of the body so that relics can be taken and sent to Rome. The relics must be sealed with wax and the body must be replaced after inspection. These ritual inspections are performed very rarely and can only be performed by a bishop respecting canon law. A pontifical commission can authorize inspection of the relics and demand a written report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/print49948.htm The Re-Vesting of the Relics of St. John of Shanghai &amp; San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; After solemn inspection of the relics, it can be decided that the body is presented in an open reliquary and displayed for veneration. Catholic law allows saints to be buried under the altar, so Mass can be celebrated above the corpse.

The relics of Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]] were inspected multiple times, and reports by the church tribunal confirmed that the body was preserved. The opening of the reliquary was attended by multiple canons, the mayor and the bishop in 1919, and repeated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicpilgrims.com/lourdes/bb_bernadette_body.htm|title=The Body of Saint Bernadette|author=|date=|website=www.catholicpilgrims.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every saint, however, is expected to have an incorruptible corpse. Although incorruptibility is recognized as supernatural, it is no longer counted as a miracle in the recognition of a saint.&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;Archived at [https://archive.is/20010610014402/http://www.discover.com/june_01/featsaints.html The Incorruptibles], ''The bodies of many medieval Catholic saints and martyrs have resisted decay for centuries— just the sort of mystery that begs for scientific inquiry'', By [[Heather Pringle]], ''Discover'' Vol. 22 No. 6 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Embalmed]] bodies were not recognized as incorruptibles. For example, although the body of [[Pope John XXIII]] remained in a remarkably intact state after its exhumation, Church officials remarked that the body had been embalmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandri |first=Luigi |title=Blessed John XXIII's Remains Are Now On View At St Peter's |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |website=Christianity Today |accessdate=11 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIPsDkFx?url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |archivedate=11 February 2014 |date=1 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally there was a lack of oxygen in his sealed triple coffin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Incorruptibility is seen as distinct from the good preservation of a body, or from [[Mummy|mummification]]. Incorruptible bodies are often said to have the [[odour of sanctity]], exuding a sweet or [[Flower|floral]], pleasant aroma.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
[[File:Anthony, John, and Eustathios in Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius-2.jpg|upright|thumb|Relics of [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]] at the [[Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius]], Lithuania.]]
To the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], a distinction is made between natural mummification and what is believed to be supernatural incorruptibility. While incorruptibility is not generally deemed to be a prerequisite for sainthood, there are a great number of eastern Orthodox saints whose bodies have been found to be incorrupt and are in much veneration among the faithful. These include:
* [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]]
* [[Saint Alexander of Svir]] – the incorrupt relics of the saint were removed from the Svir Monastery by the Bolsheviks on December 20, 1918, after several unsuccessful attempts to confiscate them. Finally, the holy relics were sent to Petrograd's Military Medical Academy. There they remained for nearly eighty years. A second uncovering of St Alexander's relics took place in December 1997, before their return to the Svir Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorthodoxword.com/back%20articles/OW%20PDFs/236/A%20Brief%20Life%20of%20St%20Alexander%20of%20Svir.pdf The Marvelous Wonderworker of All Russia, Holy Venerable Alexander of Svir.

In 1927, the cathedral itself was demolished. In the late 1980s, the relics were discovered in [[Leningrad]]'s Museum of Religion and Atheism, and on 16 September 1991, they were solemnly returned to the new Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Belgorod, in the presence of [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nm/duga/sec041.htm ST.

[[Image:Langtons Loop.png|frame|right|Langton's Loop, in the starting configuration.]]

'''Langton's loops''' are a particular "species" of [[artificial life]] in a [[cellular automaton]] created in 1984 by [[Christopher Langton]]. They consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information, which flows continuously around the loop and out along an "arm" (or [[pseudopod]]), which will become the daughter loop. The "genes" instruct it to make three left turns, completing the loop, which then disconnects from its parent.

== History ==

In 1952 [[John von Neumann]] created the first cellular automaton (CA) with the goal of creating a self-replicating machine.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.'' |author=von Neumann, John |author2=Burks, Arthur W. |date=1966 |publisher=www.walenz.org |format=Scanned book online |accessdate=2008-02-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |archivedate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automaton was necessarily very complex due to its computation- and construction-universality. In 1968 [[Edgar F. Codd]] reduced the number of states from 29 in [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] to 8 in [[Codd's cellular automaton|his]].&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Christopher Langton did away with the universality condition, he was able to significantly reduce the automaton's complexity. Its self-replicating loops are based on one of the simplest elements in Codd's automaton, the periodic emitter.

== Specification ==

Langton's Loops run in a CA that has 8 states, and uses the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. The [[State transition table|transition table]] can be found here: [http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheRules#Self-replicating_loops].

As with [[Codd's cellular automaton|Codd's CA]], Langton's Loops consist of sheathed wires. The signals travel passively along the wires until they reach the open ends, when the command they carry is executed.

[[Image:Langtons Loop Colony.png|thumb|right|A colony of loops. The ones in the centre are "dead".]]

=== Colonies ===

Because of a particular property of the loops' "pseudopodia", they are unable to reproduce into the space occupied by another loop. Thus, once a loop is surrounded, it is incapable of reproducing, resulting in a [[coral]]-like colony with a thin layer of reproducing organisms surrounding a core of inactive "dead" organisms. Unless provided unbounded space, the colony's size will be limited. The maximum population will be [[asymptote|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left \lfloor \frac{A}{121} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is the total area of the space in cells.

=== Encoding of the genome ===

The loops' genetic code is stored as a series of nonzero-zero state pairs. The standard loop's genome is illustrated in the picture at the top, and may be stated as a series of numbered states starting from the T-junction and running clockwise: 70-70-70-70-70-70-40-40. The '70' command advances the end of the wire by one cell, while the '40-40' sequence causes the left turn. State 3 is used as a temporary marker for several stages.

While the roles of states 0,1,2,3,4 and 7 are similar to Codd's CA, the remaining states 5 and 6 are used instead to mediate the loop replication process. After the loop has completed, state 5 travels counter-clockwise along the sheath of the parent loop to the next corner, causing the next arm to be produced in a different direction.  State 6 temporarily joins the genome of the daughter loop and initialises the growing arm at the next corner it reaches.

The genome is used a total of six times: once to extend the pseudopod to the desired location, four times to complete the loop, and again to [[DNA replication|transfer]] the genome into the daughter loop. Clearly, this is dependent on the fourfold [[rotational symmetry]] of the loop; without it, the loop would be incapable of containing the information required to describe it. The same use of symmetry for genome compression is used in many biological [[viruses]], such as the [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] [[adenovirus]].

'''Mika Aaltonen''' (born 16 November 1965) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] former [[association football|footballer]]. His position was an attacking central midfielder. He also played for the [[Finland national football team|Finnish national team]].

During his career (1982–1994) he played in [[Finland]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]] for [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]], [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.]] and [[Tampereen Pallo-Veikot]]. He finished his career at a relatively young age because of a persistent ankle injury, and because of this, he ended up concentrating more on his studies. Aaltonen studied throughout his playing career, and after he retired from football, he earned a doctorate degree in economics.

Aaltonen is best remembered for a superb goal scored against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]] in [[UEFA Cup]] in 1987 during a match between [[Turun Palloseura]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] stadium in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/sport/4638-the-miracle-of-san-siro.pdf | title = Helsinki Times}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal more or less earned him a transfer to Inter shortly afterwards.

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
===Robbery Attack===
On 25 October 2017, Mr 2Kay was reportedly robbed by four armed men in his hotel room at [[Eko Hotels and Suites]] at [[Victoria Island, Lagos]] after performing at [[2Baba]]’s Buckwyld and Breathless Concert, which took place at the convention centre of Eko Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singer,.Mr. 2Kay battered, robbed at gunpoint - Vanguard News|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/10/singer-mr-2Kay-battered-robbed-gunpoint/|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Vanguard News|publisher=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2Kay was left with injuries sustain from the robbery, also totally bound, arms, legs and mouth while the robbers left with his valuables which include, clothes, jewelry, phones, perfumes, and money. 1 week after robbery Mr 2Kay released a new single "Pray for Me" which was scheduled for a late November release alongside with his forthcoming album which is currently on hold due to the incident his label, [[Grafton Entertainment|Grafton Records]] has to push the album release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr. 2Kay - Pray For Me [New Music] {{!}} BellaNaija|url=https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/11/new-music-mr-2Kay-pray/|website=[[BellaNaija]]|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November 2017, Mr 2Kay reportedly filed a 500 millionaire  lawsuit against the management of [[Eko Hotels and Suites]] where the incident happened in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ROBBERY ATTACK: Mr 2Kay slams N500m lawsuit on Eko Hotel|url=https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/robbery-attack-mr-2Kay-slams-n500m-lawsuit-eko-hotel/|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Ripples Nigeria|publisher=Ripples Nigeria|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

As of this writing, a physics engine called [[Sibernetic]] has been built for the project and models of the neural [[connectome]] and a muscle cell have been created in [[NeuroML]] format. A 3D model of the worm anatomy can be accessed through the web via the OpenWorm browser. The OpenWorm project is also contributing to develop Geppetto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geppetto.org Geppetto]&lt;/ref&gt; a web-based multi-algorithm, multi-scale simulation platform engineered to support the simulation of the whole organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/30/openworm-is-going-to-be-a-digital-organism-in-your-browser/ |title=Openworm is going to be a digital organism in your browser |date=30 April 2014 |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |work=VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

'''Phenomenological life''' ({{lang-fr|vie phénoménologique}}) is life considered from a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and rigorously [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] point of view. The relevant philosophical project is called "'''radical  phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie radicale de la vie'') or "'''material phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie matérielle de la vie'').

== Definition ==

The philosopher [[Michel Henry]] defines life from a phenomenological point of view as that which possesses the faculty and the power "of feeling and experiencing oneself in each point of its being".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15, 23 et 80&lt;/ref&gt;

For Michel Henry, life is essentially subjective force and [[affectivity]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, cover page&lt;/ref&gt; — it consists of a pure subjective experience of oneself which perpetually oscillates between [[suffering]] and [[joy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; A "subjective force" is not an impersonal, blind and insensitive [[force]] like the objective forces we meet in nature, but a living and sensible force experienced from within and resulting from an inner desire and a subjective effort of the will to satisfy it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 138 et 218&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this phenomenological approach to life, in ''Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)''&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body, which is in principle insensible.

The word "phenomenological" refers to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which is the study of phenomena and a philosophical method which fundamentally concerns the study of phenomena as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; What Henry calls "absolute phenomenological life" is the subjective life of individuals reduced to its pure inner manifestation, as we perpetually live it and feel it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 46-70&lt;/ref&gt; It is life as it reveals itself and appears inwardly, its self-revelation: life is both what reveals and what is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

Life is by nature invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of a look; it reveals itself in itself without gap or distance. The fact of seeing does in effect presuppose the existence of a distance and of a separation between what is seen and the one who sees, between the object that is perceived and the subject who perceives it. A feeling, for example, can never be seen from the exterior, it never appears in the "horizon of visibility" of the world; it feels itself and experiences itself from within in the radical immanence of life. Love cannot see itself, any more than hatred; feelings are felt in the secrecy of our hearts, where no look can penetrate. 

Life is constituted of sensitivity and affectivity — it is the unity of their manifestation, affectivity being however the essence of sensibility (as Henry shows in ''The Essence of Manifestation'') which means that every sensation is affective by nature. Phenomenological life is the foundation of all our subjective experiences (like the subjective experience of a sorrow, of seeing a color or the pleasure of drinking fresh water in summer) and of each of our subjective powers (the subjective power of moving the hand or the eyes, for example).

In ''Incarnation, a philosophy of the flesh'', Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body which is as a matter of principle insensitive.

== Phenomenological vs. biological ==

This phenomenological definition of life is founded, then, in the concrete subjective experience we have of life in our own existence. It thus corresponds to human life. In ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Michel Henry writes about the other forms of life studied by biology and from which [[Heidegger]] derives his own philosophical conception of life: "Is it not paradoxical for anyone who wants to know what life is to go and ask protozoa or, in the best case, honeybees? As if our only relation with life was a wholly external and fragile relation with beings about whom we know nothing – or so very little! As if we ourselves were not living beings!"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'' (§ 3, p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition, however, fails to include living organisms that cannot experience themselves, such as plant life — unless one can find evidence of the existence of a certain kind of sensibility in them, as Professor A. Tronchet appears to suggest in his book ''La sensibilité des plantes (Plant Sensibility)'': "The protoplasm of plant cells, like that of animal cells, is endowed with irritability, i.e. a particular form of sensibility, thanks to which it is capable of being affected by excitations originating externally or internally".&lt;ref&gt;A. Tronchet, La sensibilité des plantes, Masson, 1977, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Truth of Life ==

Michel Henry explains in ''C’est Moi la Vérité. Pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity)'' what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls "the Truth of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth, which originates in Greek thought and which he calls "the truth of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 21-31&lt;/ref&gt; But what is truth? Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; 

The truth of the world designates an external and objective truth, a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us, i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows:&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 25-31.&lt;/ref&gt; when we look at an apple, it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way, when we look at a person's face, it is not the person in herself that we see, but only an image of her face, her visible appearance in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; According to this way of conceiving truth, life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised (for example) by the need to feed oneself or one's aptitude for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 58-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian thought==

In Christianity, Life is reduced to its internal reality, which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Considered in its phenomenological reality, Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations, small pleasures or great hurts, to experience desires and feelings, to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort, or even to think.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves, with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze, but only in us: we coincide with each of these abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation, and what it manifests is itself, in its feeling self-revelation&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 36-37 et 73&lt;/ref&gt; — it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is ''absolutely'' subjective — that is, it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain, for example, is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the ''absolute'' subjectivity of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true, it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation, and Life is what Christianity calls God.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another, but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities, and which illuminates the least of our impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary, it is that which is most essential for man, as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God, rather than losing himself in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}}
In [[ethics]] and other branches of [[philosophy]], [[suicide]] poses difficult questions, answered differently by various philosophers. The French essayist, novelist, and playwright [[Albert Camus]] (1913–1960) began his philosophical essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' with the famous line "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide" ({{lang-fr|Il n'y a qu'un problème philosophique vraiment sérieux : c'est le suicide}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus |first=Albert |translator-last=O'Brien |translator-first=Justin |date=1942 |title=The Myth of Sisyphus |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |page= |isbn=978-0-141-18200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of suicide==
There are arguments in favor of allowing an individual to choose between life and suicide. Those in favor of suicide as a personal choice reject the thought that suicide is always or usually irrational, but is instead a solution to real problems; a line of last resort that can legitimately be taken when the alternative is considered worse. They believe that no being should be made to suffer unnecessarily, and suicide provides an escape from suffering.

===Idealism===
{{See also|Idealism}}
[[Herodotus]] wrote: "When life is so burdensome, death has become for man a sought-after refuge". Schopenhauer affirmed: "They tell us that suicide is the greatest act of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person."

Schopenhauer's main work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', occasionally uses the act in its examples. He denied that suicide was immoral and saw it as one's right to take one's life. In an allegory, he compared ending one's life, when subject to great suffering, to waking up from sleep when experiencing a terrible nightmare. However, most suicides were seen as an act of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], as it takes place when one denies life's pains, and is thus different from ascetic renunciation of the will, which denies life's pleasures.

According to Schopenhauer, moral freedom—the highest ethical aim—is to be obtained only by a denial of the will to live. Far from being a denial, suicide is an emphatic assertion of this will. For it is in fleeing from the pleasures, not from the sufferings of life, that this denial consists. When a man destroys his existence as an individual, he is not by any means destroying his will to live. On the contrary, he would like to live if he could do so with satisfaction to himself; if he could assert his will against the power of circumstance; but circumstance is too strong for him.

===Liberalism=== &lt;!--should this be Libertarianism?--&gt;
[[Liberalism]] asserts that a person's life belongs only to them, and no other person has the right to force their own ideals that life must be lived. Rather, only the individual involved can make such a decision, and whatever decision they make should be respected.

Philosopher and psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] goes further, arguing that suicide is the most basic right of all. If freedom is [[self-ownership]]—ownership over one's own life and body—then the right to end that life is the most basic of all. If others can force you to live, you do not own yourself and belong to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide as a Moral Issue|author=Thomas Szasz|url=http://www.szasz.com/iol2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Améry]], in his book ''On Suicide: a Discourse on Voluntary Death'' (originally published in German in 1976), provides a moving insight into the suicidal mind. He argues forcefully and almost romantically that suicide represents the ultimate freedom of humanity, justifying the act with phrases such as "we only arrive at ourselves in a freely chosen death" and lamenting "ridiculously everyday life and its alienation". {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Améry killed himself in 1978.

Philosophical thinking in the 19th and 20th century has led, in some cases, beyond thinking in terms of pro-choice, to the point that suicide is no longer a last resort, or even something that one must justify, but something that one must justify {{em|not}} doing. Many forms of [[Existentialism|existentialist]] thinking essentially begin with the premise that life is objectively meaningless, and proceed to the question of why one should not just kill oneself; they then answer this question by suggesting that the individual has the power to give personal meaning to life.

===Stoicism===
Although [[George Lyman Kittredge]] states that "the Stoics held that suicide is cowardly and wrong," the most famous [[Stoicism|stoics]]—[[Seneca the Younger]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]]—maintain that death by one's own hand is always an option and frequently more honorable than a life of protracted misery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide and Brutus' Philosophy in Julius Caesar|author=Mark Sacharoff|publisher=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=33|number=1|date=Jan–Mar 1972|pages=115–122|jstor=2709060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics accepted that [[suicide]] was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pages 153–4. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency ({{lang-la|constantia}}) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease,&lt;ref name="marietta153"/&gt; but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.&lt;ref name="irvine200"&gt;William Braxton Irvine, (2009), ''A guide to the good life: the ancient art of Stoic joy'', page 200. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
{{see also|Suicide in China}}
[[Confucianism]] holds that failure to follow certain values is worse than death; hence, suicide can be morally permissible, and even praiseworthy, if it is done for the sake of those values. The Confucian emphasis on loyalty, self-sacrifice, and honour has tended to encourage [[altruistic suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stress and Suicide in Japan|journal=Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review|author1=Iga, Mamoura|author2=KS Adam (abstract)|publisher=Transcultural Psychiatry|year=1980|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/4/243.pdf|volume=17|issue=4|pages=243–244|doi=10.1177/136346158001700405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]] wrote, "For gentlemen of purpose and men of [[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]] while it is inconceivable that they should seek to stay alive at the expense of ren, it may happen that they have to accept death in order to have ren accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;Analects, trans. D.C. Lau, second edition, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1992), XV:9D&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencius]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Mencius, trans. D.C. Lau, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1984), VI A:10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Fish is what I want; bear's palm is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take bear's palm than fish. Life is what I want; [[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]] is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take yi than life. On the one hand, though life is what I want, there is something I want more than life. That is why I do not cling to life at all cost. On the other hand, though death is what I loathe, there is something I loathe more than death. That is why there are dangers I do not avoid ... Yet there are ways of remaining alive and ways of avoiding death to which a person will not resort. In other words, there are things a person wants more than life and there are also things he or she loathes more than death.}}

==Arguments against suicide==
Common philosophical opinion of suicide since modernization reflected a spread in cultural beliefs of western societies that suicide is immoral and unethical. One popular argument is that many of the reasons for committing [[suicide]]—such as [[Clinical depression|depression]], emotional pain, or economic hardship—are transitory and can be ameliorated by therapy and through making changes to some aspects of one's life. A common [[adage]] in the discourse surrounding [[suicide prevention]] sums up this view: "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." However, the argument against this is that while emotional pain may seem transitory to most people, and in many cases it is, in other cases it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to resolve, even through counseling or lifestyle change, depending upon the severity of the affliction and the person's ability to cope with their pain. Examples of this are incurable disease or lifelong mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Craig. Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. Ashgate, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absurdism===
The [[French Algeria]]n absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] saw the goal of [[absurdism]] in establishing whether suicide is a necessary response to a world which appears to be mute both on the question of God's existence (and thus what such an existence might answer) and for our search for meaning and purpose in the world. For Camus, suicide was the rejection of freedom. He thinks that fleeing from the absurdity of reality into [[illusion]]s, [[religion]], or [[death]] is not the way out. Instead of fleeing the [[Albert Camus#Camus' ideas on the Absurd|absurd]] meaninglessness of life, we should embrace life passionately.

Existentialist [[Sartre]] describes the position of Meursault, the protagonist of Camus' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' who is condemned to death, in the following way:

{{Quote|"The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions ... and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the "divine irresponsibility" of the condemned man."&lt;ref&gt;Sartre analysis of Mersault, in Literary and Philosophical Essays, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christian-inspired philosophy===
{{See also|Christian philosophy}}
[[G. K. Chesterton]] calls suicide "the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence". He argues that a person who kills himself, as far as he is concerned, destroys the entire world (apparently exactly repeating [[Maimonides]]' view).

===Liberalism===
[[John Stuart Mill]] argued, in his influential essay "[[On Liberty]]", that since the {{lang|la|[[sine qua non]]}} of liberty is the power of the individual to make choices, any choice that one might make that would deprive one of the ability to make further choices should be prevented. &lt;!-- As it stands, that assertion is worthless, since {{em|every}} choice one makes deprives one of {{em|some}} further choices; perhaps the writer means to say "all further choices", as is consistent with the next sentence. --&gt;Thus, for Mill, selling oneself into [[slavery]] should be prevented in order to avoid precluding the ability to make further choices. Concerning these matters, Mill writes in "On Liberty"

{{Quote|Not only persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other civilized countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty. His voluntary choice is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. But by selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he forgoes any future use of it, beyond that single act. He therefore defeats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principle of freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is not freedom, to be allowed to alienate his freedom.}}

It could be argued that suicide prevents further choices in the same way slavery does. However, it can also be argued that there are significant differences in not having any further involvement in decisions about your life and not having any further life to make decisions about. Suicide essentially removes the condition of being alive, not the condition of making choices about your life. 

Mill believes the individual to be the best guardian of their own interests. He uses the example of a man about to cross a broken bridge: we can forcibly stop that person and warn him of the danger, but ultimately should not prevent him from crossing the bridge—for only ''he'' knows the worth of his life balanced against the danger of crossing the bridge.

Too much should not be read into "disposing of his own lot in life" in the passage as this is not necessarily talking about anything other than slavery. Indeed, it would be odd if Mill had intended it to be about suicide but not explored the issue fully.

===Deontology===
From a [[deontological]] perspective, [[Immanuel Kant]] argues against suicide in ''Fundamental Principles of The Metaphysic of Morals''. In accordance with the second formulation of his [[categorical imperative]], Kant argues that, "He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself." Kant's theory looks at the act only, and not at its outcomes and consequences, and claims that one is ethically required to consider whether one would be willing to ''universalise'' the act: to claim ''everyone'' should behave that way. Kant argues that choosing to commit suicide entails considering oneself as a means to an end, which he rejects: a person, he says, must ''not'' be used "merely as means, but must in all actions always be considered as an end in himself." Therefore, it is unethical to commit suicide to satisfy oneself.

===Social contract===
The [[social contract]], according to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], is such that every man has "a right to risk his own life in order to preserve it."

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] reject the right of individuals to take their own life. Hobbes claims in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that natural law forbids every man "to do, that which is destructive of his life, or take away the means of preserving the same." Breaking this natural law is irrational and immoral. Hobbes also states that it is intuitively rational for men to want felicity and to fear death most.

==Neutral and situational stances==
===Honor===
Japan has a form of suicide called [[seppuku]], which is considered an honorable way to redeem oneself for transgressions or personal defeats. It was widely accepted in the days of the Samurai and even before that. It was generally seen as a privilege granted only to the samurai class; civilian criminals would thus not have this 'honor' and be executed. This reflects a view of suicide as brave and correct rather than cowardly and wrong.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Utilitarianism===
[[Utilitarianism]] can be used as a justification for, or an argument against, suicide. Though the death of a depressed person ends their suffering, the person's family and friends may grieve.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Other arguments===
[[David Hume]] left an essay on suicide to be published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/suicide.htm|title=''Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul: The Complete 1783 Edition''|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of it is concerned with the claim that suicide is an affront to God. Hume argues that suicide is no more a rebellion against God than is saving the life of someone who would otherwise die, or changing the position of anything in one's surroundings. He spends much less time dismissing arguments that it is an affront to one's duty to others or to oneself. Hume claims that suicide can be compared to retiring from society and becoming a total recluse, which is not normally considered to be immoral, although the comparison would not seem to justify a suicide that leaves in its wake children or dependents who are thereby rendered vulnerable. As for duty to self, Hume takes it to be obvious that there can be times when suicide is desirable, though he also thinks it ridiculous that anyone would consider suicide unless they first considered every other option.&lt;!-- I am not sure that my edit has captured the gist of Hume's position; an editor familiar with H.'s essay will need to review this. --&gt;

Those who support the [[right to die]] argue that suicide is acceptable under certain circumstances, such as incurable disease and old age. The idea is that although life is, in general, good, people who face irreversible suffering should not be forced to continue suffering.

[[Leonard Peikoff]] states in his book ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'':

{{Quote|Suicide is justified when man's life, owing to circumstances outside of a person's control, is no longer possible; an example might be a person with a painful terminal illness, or a prisoner in a concentration camp who sees no chance of escape. In cases such as these, suicide is not necessarily a philosophic rejection of life or of reality. On the contrary, it may very well be their tragic reaffirmation. Self-destruction in such contexts may amount to the tortured cry: "Man's life means so much to me that I will not settle for anything less. I will not accept a living death as a substitute."}}

Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has criticized "arbitrary" ethical systems that allow patients to refuse care when they are physically ill, while denying the mentally ill the right to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, JM. A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill? A Swiss Case Opens a New Debate, The Hastings Center Report. 2007;37(3):21–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wesley J. Smith]], Death on Demand: The assisted-suicide movement sheds its fig leaf, ''The Weekly Standard'', June 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11746">In biology, '''polyspermy''' describes an [[Ovum|egg]] that has been [[Fertilisation|fertilized]] by more than one [[Spermatozoon|sperm]].  [[Ploidy|Diploid]] organisms normally contain two copies of each [[chromosome]], one from each parent.  The cell resulting from polyspermy, on the other hand, contains three or more copies of each chromosome—one from the egg and one each from multiple sperm.  Usually, the result is an inviable [[zygote]]. This may occur because sperm are too efficient at reaching and fertilizing eggs due to the selective pressures of [[sperm competition]]. Such a situation is often deleterious to the female: in other words, the [[male-male competition]] among sperm spills over to create [[sexual conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnqvist, G. &amp; Rowe, L.

==Chicken and zebra finch eggs require multiple sperm==
In the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1818/20151682 |title=Polyspermy in birds: sperm numbers and embryo survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; as reported in the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/bird-eggs-are-fertilized-by-more-than-one-sperm.html |title=Bird Eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield, and one of the study’s authors, reported that eggs of zebra finches and chickens require multiple sperm, from 10 to hundreds of sperm, to penetrate the egg to ensure successful fertilization and growth of the bird embryo.

== Physiological polyspermy ==
Physiological polyspermy happens when the egg normally accepts more than one sperm but only one of the multiple sperm will actually fuse its nucleus with the nucleus of the egg. Physiological polyspermy is present in some species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Some species utilize physiological polyspermy as the proper mechanism for developing their offspring. Some of these animals include birds, [[ctenophora]], reptiles and amphibians, just to name a few. Some vertebrates that are both [[amniote]] or anamniote. For example, [[urodele amphibians]], [[cartilaginous fish]], birds and reptiles, undergo physiological polyspermy because of the [[internal fertilization]] of their yolky eggs. Sperm triggers [[egg activation]] by the induction of free calcium ion concentration in the cytoplasm of the egg. This induction plays a very critical role in both physiological polyspermy and monomeric polyspermy species. The rise in calcium causes activation of the egg. The egg will then be altered on both a biochemical and morphological level.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y. (2012). Egg activation in physiological polyspermy. Reproduction, 144(1), 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals as well as sea urchins, the sudden rise in calcium concentration occurs because of the influx of calcium ions within the egg. These calcium ions are responsible for the [[cortical granule]] reaction, and are also stored in the egg's endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology. 6th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2000. Gamete Fusion and the Prevention of Polyspermy. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10033/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physiological Polyspermy.png|thumb|During Physiological Polyspermy, the egg accepts multiple sperms but only allows one sperm to fuse its nucleus with the egg's nucleus.]] 

Unlike physiological polyspermy, monospermic fertilization deals with the analysis of the egg calcium waves, as this is the typical reproduction process in all species. Species that undergo physiological polyspermy have [[polypoidy]]-preventing mechanisms that act inside the egg. This is quite different from the normal polyspermy block on the outside of the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, N. A. T. H. A. L. I. E., &amp; Charbonneau, M. I. C. H. E. L. (1992). Intracellular free Ca2+ changes during physiological polyspermy in amphibian eggs. Development, 114(3), 617-624.&lt;/ref&gt; However, polyspermy is impossible in human reproduction. The decline in the numbers of sperm that swim to the oviduct is one of two ways that prevents polyspermy in humans. The other mechanism is the blocking of sperm in the fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;Mio, Y., Iwata, K., Yumoto, K., Kai, Y., Sargant, H. C., Mizoguchi, C., … Nishikori, K. (2012). Possible mechanism of polyspermy block in human oocytes observed by time-lapse cinematography. Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, 29(9), 951–956. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-012-9815-x&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Developmental Biology Interactive, if an egg becomes fertilized by multiple sperm, the embryo will then gain various paternal centrioles. When this happens, there is a struggle for extra chromosomes. This competition causes disarrayment in [[cleavage furrow]] formation and the consequence is death of the [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast block of polyspermy==
The eggs of [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms are [[adaptation|adapted]] to avoid this situation.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. G. 1996. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female Control: Sexual Selection by Cryptic Female Choice]''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses are particularly well characterized in the [[sea urchin]], which responds to the acceptance of one sperm by inhibiting the successful penetration of the egg by subsequent sperm.  Similar defenses exist in other [[eukaryotes]].

The prevention of polyspermy in sea urchins depends on a change in the electrical [[charge (physics)|charge]] across the surface of the egg, which is caused by the fusion of the first sperm with the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, LA.. 1976. Fast block to polyspermy in sea urchin eggs is electrically mediated. ''Nature" '''261''':68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfertilized sea urchin eggs have a negative charge inside, but the charge becomes positive upon fertilization.  When sea urchin sperm encounter an egg with a positive charge, sperm-egg fusion is blocked.  Thus, after the first sperm contacts the egg and causes the change, subsequent sperms are prevented from fusing.  This "electrical polyspermy block" is thought to result because a positively charged molecule in the sperm surface [[membrane (biology)|membrane]] is repelled by the positive charge at the egg surface.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y., Jaffe, L.A. 1989. Evidence that the voltage-dependent component in the fertilization process is contributed by the sperm. ''Developmental Biology''. '''134''':446-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical polyspermy blocks operate in many animal species, including [[frog]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[marine worm]]s, but not in the several [[mammal]]s that have been studied ([[hamster]], [[rabbit]], [[mouse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, L. A.,  M. Gould. 1985. Polyspermy-preventing mechanisms. In C. B. Metz &amp; A. Monroy (editors) Biology of Fertilization. Academic, New York. pp. 223-250.&lt;/ref&gt;  In species without an electrical block, polyspermy is usually prevented by secretion of materials that establish a mechanical barrier to polyspermy.  Animals such as sea urchins have a two-step polyspermy prevention [[evolutionary game theory|strategy]], with the fast, but transient, electrical block superseded after the first minute or so by a more slowly developing permanent mechanical block.  It is thought that electrical blocks evolved in those species where a very fast block to polyspermy is needed, due to the presence of many sperm arriving simultaneously at the egg surface, as occurs in animals such as sea urchins.  In sea urchins, fertilization occurs externally in the ocean, such that hundreds of sperm can encounter the egg within several seconds.

==Slow block of polyspermy==
In mammals, in which fertilization occurs internally, fewer sperm reach the fertilization site in the [[oviduct]]. This may be the result of the female genital tract being adapted to minimize the number of sperm reaching the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, A. W. H. 1953. Distribution of sperms in the genital tract of the female rabbit after coitus. ''Australian Journal of Biological Sciences'' '''6''':693-705.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, polyspermy preventing mechanisms are essential in mammals; a secretion reaction, the "[[cortical reaction]]" modifies the extracellular coat of the egg (the [[zona pellucida]]), and additional mechanisms that are not well understood modify the egg's plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, A.J, Evans, J.P. 2006. Mammalian membrane block to polyspermy: new insights into how mammalian eggs prevent fertilisation by multiple sperm. "Reprod Fertil Dev." '''18''':53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The zona pellucida is modified by serine proteases that are released from the cortical granules. The proteases destroy the protein link between the cell membrane and the vitelline envelope, remove any receptors that other sperm have bound to, and help to form the fertilization envelope from the cortical granules.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|title=Developmental Biology, 10th ed.|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers|location=Sunderland, MA USA|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cortical reaction occurs due to calcium oscillations inside the oocyte. What triggers such oscillations is PLC-zeta, a phospholipase unique to sperm that is very sensitive to calcium concentrations. When the first spermatozoa gets inside the oocyte, it brings in PLC-zeta, that is activated by oocyte's basal calcium concentrations, initiates formation of IP3 and causes calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, generating the oscillations in calcium concentration that will activate the oocyte and block polyspermy.&lt;ref&gt;Miao, YL &amp; Williams CJ. 2012. Calcium signaling in mammalian egg activation and embryo development: the influence of subcellular localization. Molecular Reproduction &amp; Development 79:742-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary advantage==
Female defenses select for ever more aggressive male sperm however, leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]]. On the one hand, polyspermy creates inviable zygotes and lowers female fitness, but on the other, defenses may prevent fertilization altogether. This leads to a delicate compromise between the two, and has been suggested as one possible cause for the relatively high [[infertility]] rates seen in mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, E. H., G. Arnqvist, T. E. Pitcher. 2002. The evolution of infertility: Does hatching rate in birds coevolve with female polyandry? ''Journal of Evolutionary Biology''. '''15''':702-709.&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, polyspermy is allowed to happen resulting in more than one sperm entering the egg creating viable offspring without detrimental effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snook|first=Rhonda R.|last2=Hosken|first2=David J.|last3=Karr|first3=Timothy L.|date=2011-12-01|title=The biology and evolution of polyspermy: insights from cellular and functional studies of sperm and centrosomal behavior in the fertilized egg|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/142/6/779|journal=Reproduction|language=en|volume=142|issue=6|pages=779–792|doi=10.1530/REP-11-0255|issn=1470-1626|pmid=21964827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion of Humanity''' (from French ''Religion de l'Humanité'' or ''[[w:fr:église positiviste|église positiviste]]'') is a [[secular religion]] created by [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in [[France]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://membres.lycos.fr/clotilde/temple.htm
|title = Où peut-on visiter un temple positiviste ? (Where Are Positivist Shrines to be Seen?)
|accessdate = 2007-10-30
|language = French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of [[ethical movement|ethical societies]] and "ethical churches", which led to the development of Ethical culture, [[religious humanism|congregational humanist]], and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] organisations.

==Origins==
Comte developed the ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with [[Clotilde de Vaux]], whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.&lt;ref name = "soci"&gt;Rollin Chambliss, ''Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte'', Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the "[[positivist calendar]]", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.

==Tenets==
According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was "a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity", referred to as the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being). "This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Cosmic Space)".&lt;ref name = "dave"&gt;Davies, Tony. ''Humanism'', The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 {{ISBN|0-415-11052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Système de politique positive'' (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: 
*'''altruism''', leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others.
*'''order''': Comte thought that after the [[French Revolution]], society needed restoration of order.
*'''progress''': the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies.

In ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven [[sacrament]]s:
*'''Introduction'''; (nomination and sponsoring)
*'''Admission'''; (end of education)
*'''Destination'''; (choice of a career)
*'''Marriage''';
*'''Retirement'''; (age 63),
*'''Separation'''; (social extreme unction),
*'''Incorporation'''; (absorption into history) - 3 years after death.

==Liturgy and priesthood==
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre - Posse de Erlon Jacques de Oliveira 02.JPG|thumb|Erlon Jacques de Oliveira, Temple guardian in Porto Alegre|upright=1.2]]
The Religion of Humanity was described by [[Thomas Huxley]] as "Catholicism minus Christianity".&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt; In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were ''required'' to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was "a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts." The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like [[bard]]s in ancient societies.  

This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt;

==Influence==
Davies argues that Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) - "was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx".&lt;ref name = "dave"/&gt;

The ''system'' was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', it influenced the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and [[Harriet Martineau]], for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").

Profound criticism came from [[John Stuart Mill]] who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See the central passage of Mill's ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'': John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte’s Religion of Humanity ([http://positivists.org/blog/archives/3719])&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathising with the need for a [[secular religion]], and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, in A Ryan, ‘’J S Mill’’ (London 1974) p. 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Religion of Humanity in Brazil===
Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and [[Raimundo Teixeira Mendes]] organized the "Positivist Church of Brazil." In 1897 the "Temple of Humanity" was created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BA1k09JHUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22religion+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=08euTo6046&amp;sig=PmQR3toJCZX2aCaXe8oUv7D5lvs&amp;hl=en Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SltigewTmMwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22temple+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eWbqnsEKzY&amp;sig=H6m000aZeQIU8j6YvezXlN5ejbQ&amp;hl=en#PPA113,M1 The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. [[Cândido Rondon]]'s conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83-84]&lt;/ref&gt; Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national [[flag of Brazil]] bears the "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;[http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 Bandeiras e significados] Historianet.

== Other examples ==
There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India [[Baba Faqir Chand]] established [[Manavta Mandir]] (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by [[David C. Lane]] in a book ''The Unknowing Sage''. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists [[George Holyoake]] (coiner of the term "[[secularism]]") and [[Richard Congreve]].

The mechanisms of '''reproductive isolation''' are a collection of [[evolution]]ary mechanisms, [[ethology|behaviors]] and [[physiology|physiological processes]] critical for [[speciation]]. They prevent members of different [[species]] from producing [[offspring]], or ensure that any offspring are sterile. These barriers maintain the integrity of a species by reducing [[gene flow]] between related species.&lt;ref name="T.Baker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baker | first1=H G | year=1959 | title=Reproductive methods as factors in speciation in flowering plants | url=| journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp quant Biol | volume=24 | issue=| pages=177–191 | doi=10.1101/sqb.1959.024.01.019 | pmid=13796002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.1038/hdy.1986.135 |author1=Barton N. |author2=Bengtsson B.

The mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been classified in a number of ways. Zoologist [[Ernst Mayr]] classified the mechanisms of reproductive isolation in two broad categories: pre-zygotic for those that act before [[fertilization]] (or before [[mating]] in the case of [[animal]]s) and post-zygotic for those that act after it.&lt;ref name="Mayr"&gt;Mayr, E. 1963. ''Animal species and evolution''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms are [[genetics|genetically]] controlled and can appear in species whose geographic distributions overlap ([[sympatric speciation]]) or are separate ([[allopatric speciation]]).

== Pre-zygotic isolation ==
Pre-zygotic isolation mechanisms are the most economic in terms of the [[natural selection]] of a population, as resources are not wasted on the production of a descendant that is weak, non-viable or sterile. These mechanisms include physiological or systemic barriers to fertilization.

=== Temporal or habitat isolation ===
[[File:Reproductive Isolation on California Salamander population.png|thumb|The Central Valley in California prevents two the salamander population from interacting with each other which is a habitat isolation. After many generations the two salamander gene pools will become mutated caused by natural selection. The mutation will change the DNA sequence of the two populations enough that the salamander populations can no longer successfully breed between each other making the populations of salamander become classified as different species.]]
Any of the factors that prevent potentially fertile individuals from meeting will reproductively isolate the members of distinct species.  The types of barriers that can cause this isolation include: different [[habitat]]s, physical barriers, and a difference in the time of [[sexual maturity]] or flowering.&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine, L. 1979. Biología del gen. Ed. Omega, Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-282-0551-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wiens | first1=J | year=2004 | title=Speciation and Ecology Revisited: Phylogenetic Niche Conservatism and the Origin of Species | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=58 | issue=| pages=193–197 | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the ecological or habitat differences that impede the meeting of potential pairs occurs in two fish species of the family ''[[Gasterosteidae]]'' (sticklebacks). One species lives all year round in fresh [[water]], mainly in small streams.  The other species lives in the sea during winter, but in spring and summer individuals migrate to river estuaries to reproduce. The members of the two populations are reproductively isolated due to their adaptations to distinct salt concentrations.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;
An example of reproductive isolation due to differences in the mating season are found in the toad species ''[[Bufo americanus]]'' and ''[[Bufo fowleri]]''. The members of these species can be successfully crossed in the laboratory producing healthy, fertile hybrids. However, mating does not occur in the wild even though the geographical distribution of the two species overlaps. The reason for the absence of [[inter-species mating]] is that ''B. americanus'' mates in early summer and ''B. fowleri'' in late summer.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;
Certain plant species, such as ''[[Tradescantia canaliculata]]'' and ''[[Tradescantia subaspera|T. subaspera]]'', are sympatric throughout their geographic distribution, yet they are reproductively isolated as they flower at different times of the year. In addition, one species grows in sunny areas and the other in deeply shaded areas.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens"/&gt;

=== Behavioral isolation ===
The different [[mating|mating rituals]] of animal species creates extremely powerful reproductive barriers, termed sexual or behavior isolation, that isolate apparently similar species in the majority of the groups of the animal kingdom. In [[dioecious]] species, males and females have to search for a partner, be in proximity to each other, carry out the complex mating rituals and finally copulate or release their gametes into the environment in order to breed.&lt;ref name=Wu1995&gt;{{citation

[[File:New Zealand cicada song.ogg|thumb|right|170px|The songs of birds, insects and many other animals are part of a ritual to attract potential partners of their own species. The song presents specific patterns recognizable only by members of the same species, and therefore represents a mechanism of reproductive isolation. This recording is the song of a species of [[cicada]], recorded in [[New Zealand]].]]

Mating dances, the songs of males to attract females or the mutual grooming of pairs, are all examples of typical courtship behavior that allows both recognition and reproductive isolation. This is because each of the stages of courtship depend on the behavior of the partner.  The male will only move onto the second stage of the exhibition if the female shows certain responses in her behavior.  He will only pass onto the third stage when she displays a second key behavior. The behaviors of both interlink, are synchronized in time and lead finally to copulation or the liberation of gametes into the environment.  No animal that is not physiologically suitable for fertilization can complete this demanding chain of behavior.  In fact, the smallest difference in the courting patterns of two species is enough to prevent mating (for example, a specific song pattern acts as an isolation mechanism in distinct species of grasshopper of the genus ''[[Chorthippus]]''&lt;ref name=Perdeck1958&gt;{{citation | last=Perdeck | first= A.C. | year=1958 | title=The Isolating Value of Specific Song Patterns in Two Sibling Species of Grasshoppers (''Chorthippus brunneus'' Thunb. and ''C. biguttulus'' L.) | journal=Behaviour | volume=12 | issue=1–2 | pages=1–75 | doi=10.1163/156853957X00074 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/beh/1958/00000012/F0020001/art00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Even where there are minimal morphological differences between species, differences in behavior can be enough to prevent mating. For example, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and ''[[Drosophila simulans|D. simulans]]'' which are considered twin species due to their morphological similarity, do not mate even if they are kept together in a laboratory.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;Casares, P. 2008. ''Genética de poblaciones y evolutiva''.  Capítulo 17.  Genética del aislamiento reproductivo. Universidad de Oviedo, España. [http://directo.uniovi.es/catalogo/FichaAsignatura.asp?asignatura=14036]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Drosophila ananassae]]'' and ''D. pallidosa'' are twin species from [[Melanesia]]. In the wild they rarely produce hybrids, although in the laboratory it is possible to produce fertile offspring. Studies of their sexual behavior show that the males court the females of both species but the females show a marked preference for mating with males of their own species. A different regulator region has been found on Chromosome II of both species that affects the selection behavior of the females.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

[[Pheromones]] play an important role in the sexual isolation of insect species.&lt;ref name=Coyne1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Coyne | first1=J.A. | last2=Crittenden | first2=A.P. | last3=Mah | first3=K. | year=1994 | title=Genetics of a pheromonal difference contributing to reproductive isolation in ''Drosophila'' | journal=Science | volume=265 | issue=5177 | pages=1461–1464 | doi=10.1126/science.8073292 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/265/5177/1461 | pmid=8073292
|bibcode=1994Sci...265.1461C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds serve to identify individuals of the same species and of the same or different sex. Evaporated molecules of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]] pheromones can serve as a wide-reaching chemical signal. In other cases, pheromones may be detected only at a short distance or by contact.

In species of the ''melanogaster'' group of ''Drosophila'', the pheromones of the females are mixtures of different compounds, there is a clear dimorphism in the type and/or quantity of compounds present for each sex. In addition, there are differences in the quantity and quality of constituent compounds between related species, it is assumed that the pheromones serve to distinguish between individuals of each species. An example of the role of pheromones in sexual isolation is found in 'corn borers' in the genus ''[[Ostrinia]]''. There are two twin species in Europe that occasionally cross. The females of both species produce pheromones that contain a volatile compound which has two [[isomer]]s, E and Z; 99% of the compound produced by the females of one species is in the E isomer form, while the females of the other produce 99% isomer Z. The production of the compound is controlled by just one [[locus (genetics)|locus]] and the [[Hybrid (biology)|interspecific hybrid]] produces an equal mix of the two isomers.  The males, for their part, almost exclusively detect the isomer emitted by the females of their species, such that the hybridization although possible is scarce.  The perception of the males is controlled by one [[gene]], distinct from the one for the production of isomers, the [[heterozygous]] males show a moderate response to the odour of either type.  In this case, just 2 'loci' produce the effect of ethological isolation between species that are genetically very similar.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

Sexual isolation between two species can be asymmetrical.  This can happen when the mating that produces descendants only allows one of the two species to function as the female progenitor and the other as the male, while the reciprocal cross does not occur.  For instance, half of the [[wolf|wolves]] tested in the [[Great Lakes]] area of [[United States|America]] show [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences of [[coyote]]s, while mitochondrial DNA from wolves is never found in coyote populations. This probably reflects an asymmetry in inter-species mating due to the difference in size of the two species as male wolves take advantage of their greater size in order to mate with female coyotes, while female wolves and male coyotes do not mate.&lt;ref name="LEHMAN"&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2409486 | author=LEHMAN N | last2=Eisenhawer | year=1991 | first2=A. | last3=Hansen | first3=K. | last4=David Mech | first4=L. | last5=Peterson | first5=R.

=== Mechanical isolation ===
[[File:Flores.gif|thumb|The [[flower]]s of many species of ''[[Angiosperm]]'' have evolved to attract and reward a single or a few pollinator species (insects, birds, mammals). Their wide diversity of form, colour, fragrance and presence of nectar is, in many cases, the result of [[coevolution]] with the pollinator species. This dependency on its pollinator species also acts as a reproductive isolation barrier.]]

Mating pairs may not be able to couple successfully if their genitals are not compatible. The relationship between the reproductive isolation of species and the form of their genital organs was signaled for the first time in 1844 by the French [[entomologist]] [[Léon Jean Marie Dufour|Léon Dufour]]. Insects' rigid carapaces act in a manner analogous to a lock and key, as they will only allow mating between individuals with complementary structures, that is, males and females of the same species (termed ''co-specifics'').

Evolution has led to the development of genital organs with increasingly complex and divergent characteristics, which will cause mechanical isolation between species.  Certain characteristics of the genital organs will often have converted them into mechanisms of isolation.  However, numerous studies show that organs that are anatomically very different can be functionally compatible, indicating that other factors also determine the form of these complicated structures.&lt;ref name="patc"&gt;[http://www.cienciahoy.org.ar/hoy32/gemelas.htm Costa, F. 1996. Especies gemelas. Ciencia hoy 6:32 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531183034/http://www.cienciahoy.org.ar/hoy32/gemelas.htm |date=31 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical isolation also occurs in plants and this is related to the adaptation and [[coevolution]] of each species in the attraction of a certain type of pollinator (where [[pollination]] is [[Zoophily|zoophilic]]) through a collection of [[morphology (biology)|morphophysiological]] characteristics of the flowers (called [[Pollination syndrome|floral syndromes]]), in such a way that the transport of [[pollen]] to other species does not occur.&lt;ref name=Grant1994&gt;{{citation | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.1.3 | last=Grant | first= V. | year=1994 | title=Modes and Origins of Mechanical and Ethological Isolation in Angiosperms | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=91 | issue=1 | pages=3–10 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/1/3.pdf

=== Gametic isolation ===
The synchronous [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] of many species of coral in marine [[reefs]] means that inter-species hybridization can take place as the gametes of hundreds of individuals of tens of species are liberated into the same water at the same time. Approximately a third of all the possible crosses between species are compatible, in the sense that the gametes will fuse and lead to individual hybrids. This hybridization apparently plays a fundamental role in the evolution of coral species.&lt;ref name="RAWSON "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Willis | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Babcock | first2 = R.

It has been observed that in [[sea urchin]]s of the genus ''[[Strongylocentrotus]]'' the concentration of [[spermatocyte]]s that allow 100% fertilization of the ovules of the same species is only able to fertilize 1.5% of the ovules of other species. This inability to produce hybrid offspring, despite the fact that the gametes are found at the same time and in the same place, is due to a phenomenon known as ''gamete incompatibility'', which is often found between marine invertebrates, and whose physiological causes are not fully understood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = P.

In some ''[[Drosophila]]'' crosses, the swelling of the female's [[vagina]] has been noted following insemination.  This has the effect of consequently preventing the fertilization of the ovule by sperm of a different species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Patterson, J.T. &amp; Stone, W.S. 1952. Evolution in the genus ''Drosophila''. Macmillan, Nueva York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|As just described it doesn't follow: it would prevent subsequent insemination by any species, including the female's; and not to prevent initial pre-swelling insemination by a different species.|date=October 2017}}

In plants the pollen grains of a species can germinate in the [[gynoecium|stigma]] and grow in the [[gynoecium|style]] of other species.  However, the growth of the pollen tubes may be detained at some point between the stigma and the ovules, in such a way that fertilization does not take place.  This mechanism of reproductive isolation is common in the [[angiosperm]]s and is called ''cross-incompatibility'' or ''incongruence''.&lt;ref name="Sala"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sala | first1=C.A. | year=1993 | title=Incompatibilidad cruzada entre cinco especies tuberosas de ''Solanum'' (Solanaceae) | url=| journal=Darwiniana | volume=32 | issue=| pages=15–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hogenboom1975&gt;{{citation | last1=Hogenboom | first1=N.G. | last2=Mather | first2=K. | year=1975 | title=Incompatibility and Incongruity: Two Different Mechanisms for the Non-Functioning of Intimate Partner Relationships | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=188 | issue=1092 | pages=361–375 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1975.0025 | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/J34304U409014847.pdf | bibcode=1975RSPSB.188..361H }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A relationship exists between self-incompatibility and the phenomenon of cross-incompatibility. In general crosses between individuals of a self-compatible species (SC) with individuals of a self-incompatible (SI) species give hybrid offspring.  On the other hand, a reciprocal cross (SI x SC) will not produce offspring, because the pollen tubes will not reach the ovules. This is known as ''unilateral incompatibility'', which also occurs when two SC or two SI species are crossed.&lt;ref name="Hadley "&gt;Hadley , H.H. &amp; Openshaw, S.J. 1980.

[[File:Reef0484.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[coral reefs]], ''gamete incompatibility'' prevents the formation of numerous inter-species hybrids.]]

== Post-zygotic isolation ==
A number of mechanisms which act after fertilization preventing successful inter-population crossing are discussed below.

=== Zygote mortality and non-viability of hybrids ===
A type of incompatibility that is found as often in plants as in animals occurs when the egg or [[ovule]] is fertilized but the [[zygote]] does not develop, or it develops and the resulting individual has a reduced viability.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt; This is the case for crosses between species of the [[frog]] genus, where widely differing results are observed depending of the species involved. In some crosses there is no segmentation of the zygote (or it may be that the hybrid is extremely non-viable and changes occur from the first [[mitosis]]). In others, normal segmentation occurs in the [[blastula]] but [[gastrulation]] fails. Finally, in other crosses, the initial stages are normal but errors occur in the final phases of [[embryo development]]. This indicates differentiation of the embryo development genes (or gene complexes) in these species and these differences determine the non-viability of the hybrids.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, J.A: 1949. Patterns of evolution in the genus ''Rana''. En: ''Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution''. Gepsen, G., Mayr, E. &amp; Simpson, G. (eds). Princeton University Press, pag.: 315-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results are observed in mosquitos of the genus ''[[Culex]]'', but the differences are seen between [[reciprocal cross]]es, from which it is concluded that the same effect occurs in the interaction between the genes of the [[cell nucleus]] (inherited from both parents) as occurs in the genes of the [[cytoplasmic organelles]] which are inherited solely from the female progenitor through the cytoplasm of the ovule.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

In Angiosperms, the successful development of the embryo depends on the normal functioning of its [[endosperm]].&lt;ref name=Brink1947&gt;{{citation | last1=Brink | first1=R.A. | last2=Cooper | first2=D.C. | year=1947 | title=The endosperm in seed development | journal=The Botanical Review | volume=13 | issue=9 | pages=479–541 | doi=10.1007/BF02861549 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/961M60U76M48R041.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of endosperm development and its subsequent abortion has been observed in many [[interploidy cross|interploidal crosses]] (that is, those between populations with a particular degree of intra or interspecific [[ploidy]]),&lt;ref name="Brink1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodell1961&gt;{{citation | last1=Woodell | first1=S.R.J. | last2=Valentine | first2=D.H. | year=1961 | title=Ix.

=== Hybrid sterility ===
[[File:Maultier grau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mule]]s are hybrids with interspecific sterility.]]
A hybrid has normal viability but is typically deficient in terms of reproduction or is sterile. This is demonstrated by the [[mule]] and in many other well known hybrids. In all of these cases sterility is due to the interaction between the genes of the two species involved; to chromosomal imbalances due to the different number of chromosomes in the parent species; or to nucleus-cytoplasmic interactions such as in the case of ''Culex'' described above.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

[[Hinny|Hinnies]] and mules are [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s resulting from a cross between a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]] or between a mare and a donkey, respectively. These animals are nearly always sterile due to the difference in the number of chromosomes between the two parent species. Both horses and donkeys belong to the genus ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', but ''Equus caballus'' has 64&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, while ''Equus asinus'' only has 62. A cross will produce offspring (mule or hinny) with 63&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, that will not form pairs, which means that they do not divide in a balanced manner during [[meiosis]]. In the wild, the horses and donkeys ignore each other and do not cross. In order to obtain mules or hinnies it is necessary to train the progenitors to accept copulation between the species or create them through [[artificial insemination]].

The sterility of many interspecific hybrids in [[angiosperms]] has been widely recognised and studied.&lt;ref name=Stebbins1958&gt;{{citation | last=Stebbins | first= G.L. | year=1958 | title=The inviability, weakness, and sterility of interspecific hybrids | journal=Adv Genet | volume=9 | pages=147–215 | doi=10.1016/S0065-2660(08)60162-5 | pmid=13520442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Interspecific sterility of hybrids in plants has multiple possible causes. These may be genetic, related to the genomes, or the interaction between nuclear and cytoplasmic factors, as will be discussed in the corresponding section. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in plants, hybridization is a stimulus for the creation of new species – the contrary to the situation in animals.&lt;ref name=Anderson1954&gt;{{citation | last1=Anderson | first1=E. | last2=Stebbins | first2=G.L. | year=1954 | title=Hybridization as an Evolutionary Stimulus | journal=Evolution | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=378–388 | doi=10.2307/2405784 | jstor=2405784}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the hybrid may be sterile, it can continue to multiply in the wild by [[asexual reproduction]], whether [[vegetative propagation]] or [[apomixis]] or the production of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stebbins, G.L. | first1=G. L. | year=1941 | title=Apomixis in the Angiosperms | journal=The Botanical Review | volume=7 | issue=10 | pages=507–542 | doi=10.1007/BF02872410 | jstor=4353257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell1996&gt;{{citation | last1=Campbell | first1=C.S. | last2=Wright | first2=W.A. | year=1996 | title=Apomixis, hybridization, and taxonomic complexity in eastern north American Amelanchier (Rosaceae) | journal=Folia Geobotanica | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=345–354 | doi=10.1007/BF02815379 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N38612VR74403183.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, interspecific hybridization can be associated with [[Polyploidy|polyploidia]] and, in this way, the origin of new species that are called [[allopolyploid]]s. ''[[Rosa canina]]'', for example, is the result of multiple hybridizations.&lt;ref name=Ritz2005&gt;{{citation | last1=Ritz | first1=C.

== Multiple mechanisms ==
In general, the barriers that separate species do not consist of just one mechanism.  The twin species of  ''Drosophila'', ''D. pseudoobscura'' and ''D. persimilis'', are isolated from each other by habitat (''persimilis'' generally lives in colder regions at higher altitudes), by the timing of the mating season (''persimilis'' is generally more active in the morning and ''pseuoobscura'' at night) and by behavior during mating (the females of both species prefer the males of their respective species). In this way, although the distribution of these species overlaps in wide areas of the west of the [[United States of America]], these isolation mechanisms are sufficient to keep the species separated. Such that, only a few fertile females have been found amongst the other species among the thousands that have been analyzed. However, when hybrids are produced between both species, the [[gene flow]] between the two will continue to be impeded as the hybrid males are sterile. Also, and in contrast with the great vigor shown by the sterile males, the descendants of the backcrosses of the hybrid females with the parent species are weak and notoriously non-viable. This last mechanism restricts even more the genetic interchange between the two species of fly in the wild.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

== Hybrid sex: Haldane's rule ==
[[Haldane's rule]] states that when one of the two sexes is absent in interspecific hybrids between two specific species, then the sex that is not produced, is rare or is sterile is the [[heterozygous]] (or heterogametic) sex.&lt;ref name="Haldane "&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Haldane | first1=JBS | year=1922 | title=Sex ratio and unisexual sterility in hybrid animals | url=| journal=J Genet | volume=12 | issue=| pages=101–109 | doi=10.1007/bf02983075}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, at least, there is growing evidence to suggest that this is due to high rates of mutation of the genes determining masculinity in the [[Y chromosome]].&lt;ref name="Haldane "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Short"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Short | first1=R. V. | year=1997 | title=An Introduction to Mammalian Interspecific Hybrids | url=| journal=Journal of Heredity | volume=88 | issue=| pages=355–357 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a023117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu1993&gt;{{citation | last1=Wu | first1=C.I. | last2=Davis | first2=A.W. | year=1993 | title=Evolution of Postmating Reproductive Isolation: the Composite Nature of Haldane\'s Rule and Its Genetic Bases | journal=American Naturalist | volume=142 | pmid=19425975 | issue=2 | pages=187–212 | doi=10.1086/285534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Haldane's rule simply reflects the fact that the male sex is more sensitive than the female when the sex-determining genes are included in a hybrid genome. But there are also organisms in which the heterozygous sex is the female: [[bird]]s and [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and the law is followed in these organisms. Therefore, it is not a problem related to sexual development, nor with the sex chromosomes. Haldane proposed that the stability of hybrid individual development requires the full gene complement of each parent species, so that the hybrid of the heterozygous sex is unbalanced (i.e. missing at least one chromosome from each of the parental species). For example, the hybrid male obtained by crossing  ''D. melanogaster'' females with  '' D. simulans'' males, which is non-viable, lacks the X chromosome of '' D. simulans''.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

== Genetics ==

=== Pre-copulatory mechanisms in animals ===
The genetics of [[ethological]] isolation barriers will be discussed first. Pre-copulatory isolation occurs when the genes necessary for the sexual reproduction of one species differ from the equivalent genes of another species, such that if a male of species A and a female of species B are placed together they are unable to copulate. Study of the genetics involved in this reproductive barrier tries to identify the genes that govern distinct sexual behaviors in the two species. The males of  ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and those of  ''D. simulans'' conduct an elaborate courtship with their respective females, which are different for each species, but the differences between the species are more quantitative than qualitative.  In fact the ''simulans'' males are able to hybridize with the  ''melanogaster'' females. Although there are lines of the latter species that can easily cross there are others that are hardly able to. Using this difference, it is possible to assess the minimum number of genes involved in pre-copulatory isolation between the ''melanogaster'' and ''simulans'' species and their chromosomal location.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

In experiments, flies of the ''D. melanogaster'' line, which hybridizes readily with ''simulans'',  were crossed with another line that it does not hybridize with, or rarely.  The females of the segregated populations obtained by this cross were placed next to ''simulans'' males and the percentage of hybridization was recorded, which is a measure of the degree of reproductive isolation. It was concluded from this experiment that 3 of the 8 chromosomes of the [[haploid]] complement of  ''D. melanogaster '' carry at least one gene that affects isolation, such that substituting one chromosome from a line of low isolation with another of high isolation reduces the hybridization frequency. In addition, interactions between chromosomes are detected so that certain combinations of the chromosomes have a multiplying effect.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;
Cross incompatibility or incongruence in plants is also determined by major genes that are not associated at the [[self-incompatibility]] ''S locus''.&lt;ref name=Mutschler1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Mutschler | first1=M.A. | last2=Liedl | first2=B.E. | year=1994 | title=9.

=== Post-copulation or fertilization mechanisms in animals ===
Reproductive isolation between species appears, in certain cases, a long time after fertilization and the formation of the zygote, as happens – for example – in the twin species ''[[Drosophila pavani]]'' and ''[[Drosophila gaucha|D. gaucha]]''. The hybrids between both species are not sterile, in the sense that they produce viable gametes, ovules and spermatozoa. However, they cannot produce offspring as the sperm of the hybrid male do not survive in the semen receptors of the females, be they hybrids or from the parent lines. In the same way, the sperm of the males of the two parent species do not survive in the reproductive tract of the hybrid female.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt; This type of post-copulatory isolation appears as the most efficient system for maintaining reproductive isolation in many species.&lt;ref name=Templeton1981&gt;{{citation | last=Templeton | first= A.R. | year=1981 | title=Mechanisms of Speciation-A Population Genetic Approach | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=23–48 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.000323 | url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.es.12.110181.000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a zygote into an adult is a complex and delicate process of interactions between genes and the environment that must be carried out precisely, and if there is any alteration in the usual process, caused by the absence of a necessary gene or the presence of a different one, it can arrest the normal development causing the non-viability of the hybrid or its sterility. It should be borne in mind that half of the chromosomes and genes of a hybrid are from one species and the other half come from the other. If the two species are genetically different, there is little possibility that the genes from both will act harmoniously in the hybrid. From this perspective, only a few genes would be required in order to bring about post copulatory isolation, as opposed to the situation described previously for pre-copulatory isolation.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Wu | first1=C. | last2=Palopoli | first2=M.F. | year=1994 | title=Genetics of Postmating Reproductive Isolation in Animals | journal=Annual Review of Genetics | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=283–308 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many species where pre-copulatory reproductive isolation does not exist, hybrids are produced but they are of only one sex. This is the case for the hybridization between females of ''Drosophila simulans'' and ''Drosophila melanogaster'' males: the hybridized females die early in their development so that only males are seen among the offspring. However, populations of ''D. simulans'' have been recorded with genes that permit the development of adult hybrid females, that is, the viability of the females is "rescued". It is assumed that the normal activity of these [[speciation]] genes is to "inhibit" the expression of the genes that allow the growth of the hybrid. There will also be regulator genes.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

A number of these genes have been found in the ''melanogaster'' species group. The first to be discovered was "Lhr" (Lethal hybrid rescue) located in Chromosome II of ''D. simulans''. This [[dominant allele]] allows the development of hybrid females from the cross between ''simulans'' females and ''melanogaster'' males.&lt;ref name=Watanabe1979&gt;{{citation | last=Watanabe | first= T.K. | year=1979 | title=A Gene That Rescues the Lethal Hybrids Between ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' | journal= The Japanese journal of genetics| volume=54 | issue=5 | pages=325–331 | url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/ggs1921/54.325?from=Google | doi=10.1266/jjg.54.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different gene, also located on Chromosome II of ''D. simulans'' is "Shfr" that also allows the development of female hybrids, its activity being dependent on the temperature at which [[Drosophila embryogenesis|development]] occurs.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2000&gt;{{citation | last1=Carracedo | first1=Maria C. | last2=Asenjo | first2=Ana | last3=Casares | first3=Pelayo | year=2000 | title=Location of Shfr, a new gene that rescues hybrid female viability in crosses between ''Drosophila simulans'' females and ''D. melanogaster'' males | journal=Heredity | volume=84 | issue=6 | pages=630–638 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00658.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar genes have been located in distinct populations of species of this group. In short, only a few genes are needed for an effective post copulatory isolation barrier mediated through the non-viability of the hybrids.

As important as identifying an isolation gene is knowing its function. The ''Hmr'' gene, linked to the X chromosome and implicated in the viability of male hybrids between ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'', is a gene from the [[proto-oncogene]] family ''[[MYB (gene)|myb]]'', that codes for a transcriptional regulator. Two variants of this gene function perfectly well in each separate species, but in the hybrid they do not function correctly, possibly due to the different genetic background of each species. Examination of the allele sequence of the two species shows that change of direction substitutions are more abundant than [[synonymous substitution]]s, suggesting that this gene has been subject to intense natural selection.&lt;ref name=Hutter1990&gt;{{citation | last1=Hutter | first1=P. | last2=Roote | first2=J. | last3=Ashburner | first3=M. | year=1990 | title=A Genetic Basis for the Inviability of Hybrids Between Sibling Species of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Genetics | volume=124 | issue=4 | pages=909–920 | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/124/4/909.pdf | pmid=2108905 | pmc=1203982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]-Muller model proposes that reproductive incompatibilities between species are caused by the interaction of the genes of the respective species. It has been demonstrated recently that ''Lhr'' has functionally diverged in ''D. simulans'' and will interact with ''Hmr'' which, in turn, has functionally diverged in ''D. melanogaster'' to cause the lethality of the male hybrids. ''Lhr'' is located in a heterochromatic region of the genome and its sequence has diverged between these two species in a manner consistent with the mechanisms of positive selection.&lt;ref name=Brideau2006&gt;{{citation | last1=Brideau | first1=Nicholas J. | last2=Flores | first2=Heather A. | last3=Wang | first3=Jun | last4=Maheshwari | first4=Shamoni | last5=Wang | first5=Xu | last6=Barbash | first6=Daniel A. | year=2006 | title=Two Dobzhansky-Muller Genes Interact to Cause Hybrid Lethality in ''Drosophila'' | journal=Science | volume=314 | issue=5803 | pages=1292–1295 | doi=10.1126/science.1133953 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5803/1292 | pmid=17124320|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1292B }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important unanswered question is whether the genes detected correspond to old genes that initiated the speciation favoring hybrid non-viability, or are modern genes that have appeared post-speciation by mutation, that are not shared by the different populations and that suppress the effect of the primitive non-viability genes. The ''OdsH'' (abbreviation of ''Odysseus'') gene causes partial sterility in the hybrid between ''Drosophila simulans'' and a related species, ''D. mauritiana'', which is only encountered on [[Mauritius]], and is of recent origin. This gene shows [[monophyly]] in both species and also has been subject to natural selection. It is thought that it is a gene that intervenes in the initial stages of speciation, while other genes that differentiate the two species show [[polyphyly]]. ''Odsh'' originated by duplication in the genome of ''Drosophila'' and has evolved at very high rates in ''D. mauritania'', while its [[paralogue]], ''unc-4'', is nearly identical between the species of the group ''melanogaster''.&lt;ref name=Ting2004&gt;{{citation | last1=Ting | first1=Chau-Ti | last2=Tsaur | first2=Shun-Chern | last3=Sun | first3=Sha | last4=Browne | first4=William E. | last5=Chen | first5=Yung-Chia | last6=Patel | first6=Nipam H. | last7=Wu | first7=Chung-I | year=2004 | title=Gene duplication and speciation in ''Drosophila'': Evidence from the ''Odysseus'' locus | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=101 | issue=33 | pages=12232–12235 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0401975101 | pmc=514461 | pmid=15304653|bibcode=2004PNAS..10112232T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nei1998&gt;{{citation | last1=Nei | first1=Masatoshi | last2=Zhang | first2=Jianzhi | year=1998 | title=EVOLUTION: Molecular Origin of Species | journal=Science | volume=282 | issue=5393 | pages=1428–1429 | doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1428 | url=http://www.bio.psu.edu/people/faculty/nei/lab/1998-nei-zhang2.pdf | pmid=9867649 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905135808/http://www.bio.psu.edu/People/Faculty/Nei/Lab/1998-nei-zhang2.pdf | archivedate=5 September 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sun2004&gt;{{citation | last1=Sun | first1=Sha | last2=Ting | first2=Chau-Ti | last3=Wu | first3=Chung-I | year=2004 | title=The Normal Function of a Speciation Gene, ''Odysseus'', and Its Hybrid Sterility Effect | journal=Science | volume=305 | issue=5680 | pages=81–83 | doi=10.1126/science.1093904 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/305/5680/81 | pmid=15232104 |bibcode=2004Sci...305...81S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting2000&gt;{{citation | last1=Ting | first1=Chau-Ti | last2=Tsaur | first2=Shun-Chern | last3=Wu | first3=Chung-I | year=2000 | title=The phylogeny of closely related species as revealed by the genealogy of a speciation gene, ''Odysseus'' | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=97 | issue=10 | pages=5313–5316 | doi=10.1073/pnas.090541597 | pmc=25825 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/97/10/5313.pdf | pmid=10779562|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.5313T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seemingly, all these cases illustrate the manner in which speciation mechanisms originated in nature, therefore they are collectively known as "speciation genes", or possibly, gene sequences with a normal function within the populations of a species that diverge rapidly in response to positive selection thereby forming reproductive isolation barriers with other species.

The ''Nup96'' gene is another example of the evolution of the genes implicated in post-copulatory isolation. It regulates the production of one of the approximately 30 proteins required to form a [[nuclear pore]]. In each of the ''simulans'' groups of ''Drosophila'' the protein from this gene interacts with the protein from another, as yet undiscovered, gene on the X chromosome in order to form a functioning pore. However, in a hybrid the pore that is formed is defective and causes sterility. The differences in the sequences of ''Nup96'' have been subject to adaptive selection, similar to the other examples of  ''speciation genes'' described above.&lt;ref name=Presgraves2003&gt;{{citation | last1=Presgraves | first1=D.C. | last2=Balagopalan | first2=L. | last3=Abmayr | first3=S.M. | last4=Orr | first4=H.A. | year=2003 | title=Adaptive evolution drives divergence of a hybrid inviability gene between two species of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Nature | pmid=12802326 | volume=423 | issue=6941 | pages=715–719 | doi=10.1038/nature01679 | url=http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf | bibcode=2003Natur.423..715P | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801084253/http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf | archivedate=1 August 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbash2007&gt;{{citation| last=Barbash | first= Daniel A. | year=2007 | title=''Nup96''-Dependent Hybrid Lethality Occurs in a Subset of Species from the ''simulans'' Clade of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Genetics | volume=176 | issue=1 | pages=543–52 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.072827 | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/176/1/543| pmc=1893067 | pmid=17409061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-copulatory isolation can also arise between chromosomally differentiated populations due to [[chromosomal translocation]]s and [[chromosomal inversion|inversion]]s.&lt;ref name=Noor2001&gt;{{citation | doi=10.1073/pnas.221274498 | last1=Noor | first1=M.A.F. | last2=Grams | first2=K.L. | last3=Bertucci | first3=L.A. | last4=Reiland | first4=J. | year=2001 | title=Chromosomal inversions and the reproductive isolation of species | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=98 | issue=21

This will result in the production of unequal gametes containing unequal numbers of chromosomes with a reduced fertility. In certain cases, complete translocations exist that involve more than two chromosomes, so that the meiosis of the hybrids is irregular and their fertility is zero or nearly zero.&lt;ref name=Rieseberg2001&gt;{{citation | last=Rieseberg | first=L.H. | year=2001 | title=Chromosomal rearrangements and speciation | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=16 | issue=7 | pages=351–358 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02187-5 | url=http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731100955/http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf | archivedate=31 July 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inversions can also give rise to abnormal gametes in heterozygous individuals but this effect has little importance compared to translocations.&lt;ref name="Noor2001" /&gt; An example of chromosomal changes causing sterility in hybrids comes from the study of ''[[Drosophila nasuta]]'' and ''[[Drosophila albomicans|D. albomicans]]'' which are twin species from the Indo-Pacific region. There is no sexual isolation between them and the [[F1 hybrid]] is fertile. However, the F2 hybrids are relatively infertile and leave few descendants which have a skewed ratio of the sexes. The reason is that the X chromosome of ''albomicans'' is translocated and linked to an [[autosome]] which causes abnormal meiosis in hybrids. [[Robertsonian translocation]]s are variations in the numbers of chromosomes that arise from either: the fusion of two [[centromere|acrocentric]] chromosomes into a single chromosome with two arms, causing a reduction in the haploid number, or conversely; or the fission of one chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes, in this case increasing the haploid number. The hybrids of two populations with differing numbers of chromosomes can experience a certain loss of fertility, and therefore a poor adaptation, because of irregular meiosis.

=== In plants ===
{{further|Reproductive coevolution in Ficus}}

A large variety of mechanisms have been demonstrated to reinforce reproductive isolation between closely related plant species that either historically lived or currently live in [[sympatry]]. This phenomenon is driven by strong selection against hybrids, typically resulting from instances in which hybrids suffer reduced fitness. Such negative fitness consequences have been proposed to be the result of negative [[epistasis]] in hybrid genomes and can also result from the effects of [[hybrid sterility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Taylor | first1=S. | last2=Arnold | first2=M. | last3=Martin | first3=M. | year=2009 | title=The genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in Louisiana irises: Hybrid fitness in nature | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=63 | issue=10| pages=2581–2594 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00742.x | pmid=19549289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, selection gives rise to population-specific isolating mechanisms to prevent either fertilization by interspecific gametes or the development of hybrid embryos.

Because many sexually reproducing species of plants are exposed to a variety of interspecific [[gametes]], natural selection has given rise to a variety of mechanisms to prevent the production of hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kephart | first1=S. | last2=Heiser | first2=C. | year=1980 | title=Reproductive isolation in Asclepias: Lock and Key Hypothesis Reconsidered | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=34 | issue=4| pages=738–746 | doi=10.2307/2408028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms can act at different stages in the developmental process and are typically divided into two categories, pre-fertilization and post-fertilization, indicating at which point the barrier acts to prevent either zygote formation or development. In the case of [[angiosperms]] and other pollinated species, pre-fertilization mechanisms can be further subdivided into two more categories, pre-pollination and post-pollination, the difference between the two being whether or not a pollen tube is formed. (Typically when pollen encounters a receptive stigma, a series of changes occur which ultimately lead to the growth of a pollen tube down the style, allowing for the formation of the zygote.) Empirical investigation has demonstrated that these barriers act at many different developmental stages and species can have none, one, or many barriers to hybridization with interspecifics.

=== Examples of pre-fertilization mechanisms ===&lt;!--poor choice of section organisation--&gt;

A well-documented example of a pre-fertilization isolating mechanism comes from study of Louisiana iris species.  These iris species were fertilized with interspecific and conspecific pollen loads and it was demonstrated by measure of hybrid progeny success that differences in pollen-tube growth between interspecific and conspecific pollen led to a lower fertilization rate by interspecific pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carney | first1=S. | last2=Hodges | first2=S. | year=1996 | title=Effects of Differential Pollen-tube Growth on Hybridization in Louisiana Irises | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=50 | issue=5| pages=1871–1878 | doi=10.2307/2410745}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates how a specific point in the reproductive process is manipulated by a particular isolating mechanism to prevent hybrids.

Another well-documented example of a pre-fertilization isolating mechanism in plants comes from study of the 2 wind-pollinated birch species. Study of these species led to the discovery that mixed conspecific and interspecific pollen loads still result in 98% conspecific fertilization rates, highlighting the effectiveness of such barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Williams | first1=J. | last2=Friedman | first2=W. | last3=Arnold | first3=M. | year=1999 | title=Developmental selection within the angiosperm style: Using gamete DNA to visualize interspecific pollen competition | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=96 | issue=| pages=9201–9206 | doi=10.1073/pnas.96.16.9201| pmc=17757 | bibcode=1999PNAS...96.9201W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, pollen tube incompatibility and slower generative mitosis have been implicated in the post-pollination isolation mechanism.

=== Examples of post-fertilization mechanisms ===&lt;!--poor choice of section organisation--&gt;

Crosses between diploid and tetraploid species of Paspalum provide evidence of a post-fertilization mechanism preventing hybrid formation when pollen from tetraploid species was used to fertilize a female of a diploid species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Norrmann | first1=G. | last2=Bovo | first2=O. | year=2007 | title=Post-zygotic seed abortion in sexual diploid apomitic tetraploid intra-specific Paspalum crosses | url=| journal=Australian Journal of Botany | volume=42 | issue=4| pages=449–456 | doi=10.1071/bt9940449}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were signs of fertilization and even endosperm formation but subsequently this endosperm collapsed. This demonstrates evidence of an early post-fertilization isolating mechanism, in which the hybrid early embryo is detected and selectively aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kinoshita | first1=T | year=2007 | title=Reproductive barrier and genomic imprinting in the endosperm of flowering plants | url=| journal=Genes &amp; Genetic Systems | volume=82 | issue=3| pages=177–86 | doi=10.1266/ggs.82.177}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can also occur later during development in which developed, hybrid seeds are selectively aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Emms | first1=S. | last2=Hodges | first2=S. | last3=Arnold | first3=M. | year=1996 | title=Pollen-tube competition; siring success and consistent asymmetric hybridization in Louisiana iries | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=50 | issue=6| pages=2201–2201 | doi=10.2307/2410691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of hybrid necrosis ===
Plant hybrids often suffer from an autoimmune syndrome known as hybrid necrosis. In the hybrids, specific gene products contributed by one of the parents may be inappropriately recognized as foreign and pathogenic, and thus trigger pervasive cell death throughout the plant.&lt;ref name="pmid17404584"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Bomblies K, Weigel D | title=Hybrid necrosis: autoimmunity as a potential gene-flow barrier in plant species | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=5 | pages=382–393 | year=2007 | pmid=17404584 | doi=10.1038/nrg2082| issn=| postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case, a pathogen receptor, encoded by the most variable gene family in plants, was identified as being responsible for hybrid necrosis.&lt;ref name="pmid17803357"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Bomblies K, Lempe J, Epple P, Warthmann N, Lanz C, Dangl JL, Weigel D | title=Autoimmune response as a mechanism for a Dobzhansky-Muller-type incompatibility syndrome in plants | journal=PLoS Biol. | volume=5 | issue=9 | pages=e23 | year=2007 | pmid=17803357 | pmc=1964774 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050236| issn=| postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromosomal rearrangements in yeast ===
In brewers' yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s are a major mechanism to reproductively isolate different strains. Hou et al.&lt;ref name="Hou2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid=24814147 | year=2014 | last1=Hou | first1=J. | title=Chromosomal Rearrangements as a Major Mechanism in the Onset of Reproductive Isolation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal=Current Biology| volume=24| issue=10| pages=1153–9| last2=Friedrich| first2=A.| last3=De Montigny| first3=J.| last4=Schacherer| first4=J.| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reproductive isolation acts postzygotically and could be attributed to chromosomal rearrangements. These authors crossed 60 natural isolates sampled from diverse niches with the reference strain S288c and identified 16 cases of reproductive isolation with reduced offspring viabilities, and identified reciprocal chromosomal translocations in a large fraction of isolates.&lt;ref name="Hou2014" /&gt;

=== Incompatibility caused by microorganisms ===
In addition to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of [[microorganism]]s in the cytoplasm of certain species. The presence of these organisms in a species and their absence in another causes the non-viability of the corresponding hybrid. For example, in the [[semi-species]] of the group ''D. paulistorum'' the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, this is due to the presence of a ''[[Wolbachia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001214| pmid=21151959| pmc=2996333|title = Infectious Speciation Revisited: Impact of Symbiont-Depletion on Female Fitness and Mating Behavior of Drosophila paulistorum| journal=PLOS Pathogens| volume=6| issue=12| pages=e1001214|year = 2010|last1 = Miller|first1 = Wolfgang J.| last2=Ehrman| first2=Lee| last3=Schneider| first3=Daniela}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cytoplasm which alters [[spermatogenesis]] leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of ''D. simulans'' have been studied that show hybrid sterility according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism ''[[Wolbachia]]'' and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific [[antibiotic]] to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this [[symbiosis|symbiont]]. It has been suggested that, in some cases, the speciation process has taken place because of the incompatibility caused by this bacteria. Two [[wasp]] species ''[[Nasonia giraulti]]'' and ''N. longicornis'' carry two different strains of ''Wolbachia''. Crosses between an infected population and one free from infection produces a nearly total reproductive isolation between the semi-species. However, if both species are free from the bacteria or both are treated with antibiotics there is no reproductive barrier.&lt;ref name=Breeuwer1990&gt;{{citation | last1=Breeuwer | first1=J.A.J. | last2=Werren | first2=J.H. | year=1990 | title=Microorganisms associated with chromosome destruction and reproductive isolation between two insect species | journal=Nature | pmid=2377229 | volume=346 | issue=6284 | pages=558–560 | doi=10.1038/346558a0 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v346/n6284/abs/346558a0.html

In 1950 [[K. F. Koopman]] reported results from experiments designed to examine the hypothesis that [[artificial selection|selection]] can increase reproductive isolation between populations. He used ''D. pseudoobscura'' and ''D. persimilis'' in these experiments. When the flies of these species are kept at 16&amp;nbsp;°C approximately a third of the matings are interspecific. In the experiment equal numbers of males and females of both species were placed in containers suitable for their survival and reproduction. The progeny of each generation were examined in order to determine if there were any interspecific hybrids. These hybrids were then eliminated. An equal number of males and females of the resulting progeny were then chosen to act as progenitors of the next generation. As the hybrids were destroyed in each generation the flies that solely mated with members of their own species produced more surviving descendants than the flies that mated solely with individuals of the other species. In the adjacent table it can be seen that for each generation the number of hybrids continuously decreased up to the tenth generation when hardly any interspecific hybrids were produced.&lt;ref name=Koop&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2405390 | author=Koopman K.F. | year=1950 | title=Natural selection for reproductive isolation between ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosophila persimilis''| journal=Evolution | volume=4 | issue=2| pages=135–148 | postscript=. | jstor=2405390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident that selection against the hybrids was very effective in increasing reproductive isolation between these species. From the third generation, the proportions of the hybrids were less than 5%. This confirmed that selection acts to reinforce the reproductive isolation of two genetically divergent populations if the hybrids formed by these species are less well adapted than their parents.

These discoveries allowed certain assumptions to be made regarding the origin of reproductive isolation mechanisms in nature. Namely, if selection reinforces the degree of reproductive isolation that exists between two species due to the poor adaptive value of the hybrids, it is expected that the populations of two species located in the same area will show a greater reproductive isolation than populations that are geographically separated (see [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]]). This mechanism for "reinforcing" hybridization barriers in sympatric populations is also known as the "[[Wallace effect]]", as it was first proposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] at the end of the 19th century, and it has been experimentally demonstrated in both plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ollerton|first=J|title=Flowering time and the Wallace Effect|url=http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|work=Heredity, August 2005|accessdate=2007-05-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605063504/http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer1981&gt;{{citation | last1=Sawyer | first1=S. | last2=Hartl | first2=D. | year=1981 | title=On the evolution of behavioral reproductive isolation: the Wallace effect | journal=Theor.

The sexual isolation between ''[[Drosophila miranda]]'' and ''D. pseudoobscura'', for example, is more or less pronounced according to the geographic origin of the flies being studied. Flies from regions where the distribution of the species is superimposed show a greater sexual isolation than exists between populations originating in distant regions.

[[File:Drosophila speciation.svg|thumb|right|550px|Reproductive isolation can be caused by allopatric speciation. A population of ''Drosophila'' was divided into sub populations selected to adapt to different food types. After some generations the two sub populations were mixed again. Subsequent matings occurred between individuals belonging to the same adapted group.&lt;ref name=Dodd/&gt;]]

On the other hand, interspecific hybridization barriers can also arise as a result of the adaptive divergence that accompanies [[allopatric speciation]]. This mechanism has been experimentally proved by an experiment carried out by [[Diane Dodd]] on ''D. pseudoobscura''. A single population of flies was divided into two, with one of the populations fed with [[starch]]-based food and the other with [[maltose]]-based food.  This meant that each sub population was adapted to each food type over a number of generations. After the populations had diverged over many generations, the groups were again mixed; it was observed that the flies would mate only with others from their adapted population. This indicates that the mechanisms of reproductive isolation can arise even though the interspecific hybrids are not selected against.&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodd | first1 = D.M.B. | year = 1989 | title = Reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptive divergence in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' | url = http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evolution | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 1308–1311 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100331155909/http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf | archivedate = 31 March 2010 | df = dmy-all | doi=10.2307/2409365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semelparity''' and '''iteroparity''' are two classes of possible reproductive strategies available to living organisms.  A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single reproductive episode before death, and iteroparous if it is characterized by multiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime.  Some [[Botany|botanists]] use the parallel terms [[monocarpy]] and [[polycarpy]]. (See also [[plietesials]].)

In truly semelparous species, death after reproduction is part of an overall strategy that includes putting all available resources into maximizing reproduction, at the expense of future life (see "[[#Trade-offs|Trade-offs]]", below). In any iteroparous population there will be some individuals who die between their first and second reproductive episodes, but unless this is part of a syndrome of programmed death after reproduction, this would not be called semelparity.

This distinction is also related to the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants.  An annual is a plant that completes its life cycle in a single season, and is usually semelparous. Perennials live for more than one season and are usually (but not always) iteroparous.&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, Nicholas J. (2008). ''A Primer of Ecology.'' Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-87893-318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semelparity and iteroparity are not, strictly speaking, alternative strategies, but extremes along a continuum of possible modes of reproduction. Many organisms considered to be semelparous can, under certain conditions, separate their single bout of reproduction into two or more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facultative Second Oviposition as an Adaptation to Egg Loss in a Semelparous Crab Spider|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x/abstract|journal = Ethology|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 1439-0310|pages = 1126–1138|volume = 111|issue = 12|doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x|first = Kyoko|last = Futami|first2 = Shin-ichi|last2 = Akimoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing reproductive effort within a semelparous reproductive episode|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/8/1323|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 25156981|pages = 1323–1331|volume = 101|issue = 8|doi = 10.3732/ajb.1400283|first = P.

[[File:Oncorhynchus nerka 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] is an example of a semelparous organism]]The word semelparity was coined by evolutionary biologist Lamont Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lamont C.|title=The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 1954|volume=29|issue=2|pages=103–137|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2817654?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102442342007|accessdate=June 22, 2013|doi=10.1086/400074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the Latin ''semel'' 'once, a single time' and ''pario'' 'to beget'. This differs from&amp;nbsp;iteroparity&amp;nbsp;in that iteroparous species are able to have multiple reproductive cycles and therefore can mate more than once in their lifetime. Semelparity is also known as "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large as well as fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Ricklefs and Gary Leon Miller (1999). ''Ecology.'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-7167-2829-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A classic example of a semelparous organism is Pacific salmon (''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' spp.), which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and dying. Other semelparous animals include many insects, including some species of butterflies, cicadas, and [[mayfly|mayflies]], many [[arachnids]], and some molluscs such as some species of [[squid]] and [[octopus]].

Semelparity also occurs in [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[capelin]], but is very rare in vertebrates other than bony fish. In [[amphibian]]s, it is known only among some ''[[Hyla]]'' frogs including the [[Hyla|gladiator frog]];&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Matle; ''Sexual Selection''; p. 242. {{ISBN|0691000573}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reptiles only a few lizards such as [[Labord's chameleon]] of southwestern [[Madagascar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2449350 | pmid=18591659 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0802468105 | volume=105 | title=A unique life history among tetrapods: an annual chameleon living mostly as an egg | year=2008 | journal=Proc.

This form of lifestyle is consistent with&amp;nbsp;[[R/K selection theory|r-selected]]&amp;nbsp;strategies as many offspring are produced and there is low parental input, as one or both parents die after mating. All of the male’s energy is diverting into mating and the immune system is repressed. High levels of&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]s&amp;nbsp;are sustained over long periods of time. This triggers immune and inflammatory system failure and&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhage]], which eventually leads to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oakwood|first=Meri|last2=Bradley|first2=Adrian J.|last3=Cockburn|first3=Andrew|date=2001-02-22|title=Semelparity in a large marsupial|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1465/407|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=268|issue=1465|pages=407–411|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1369|issn=0962-8452|pmid=11270438|pmc=1088621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iteroparity===

[[File:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb| An iteroparous organism is one that can undergo many reproductive events throughout its lifetime. The [[pig]] is an example of an iteroparous organism]]The term iteroparity comes from the Latin ''itero'', to repeat, and ''pario'', to beget.  An example of an iteroparous organism is a human—though people may choose to have only one child (or even none), humans are biologically capable of having offspring many times over the course of their lives.

Iteroparous vertebrates include all birds, most reptiles, virtually all mammals, and most fish. Among invertebrates, most mollusca and many insects (for example, mosquitoes and cockroaches) are iteroparous.  Most perennial plants are iteroparous.

==Models==

===Trade-offs===
It is a biological precept that within its lifetime an organism has a limited amount of energy/resources available to it, and must always partition it among various functions such as collecting food and finding a mate.  Of relevance here is the trade-off between [[fecundity]], growth, and survivorship in its [[life history theory|life history]] strategy. These trade-offs come into play in the evolution of iteroparity and semelparity.  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that semelparous species produce more offspring in their single fatal reproductive episode than do closely related iteroparous species in any one of theirs.  However, the opportunity to reproduce more than once in a lifetime, and possibly with greater care for the development of offspring produced, can offset this strictly numerical benefit.

===Models based on non-linear trade-offs===

[[File:reproductive effort iteroparous.svg|thumb|right|Iteroparous reproductive effort]]
One class of models that tries to explain the differential evolution of semelparity and iteroparity examines the shape of the trade-off between offspring produced and offspring forgone.  In [[economic]] terms, offspring produced is equivalent to a [[cost-benefit analysis|benefit]] function, while offspring forgone is comparable to a [[cost]] function.  The reproductive effort of an organism—the proportion of energy that it puts into reproducing, as opposed to growth or survivorship—occurs at the point where the distance between offspring produced and offspring forgone is the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moorcroft, "Life History Strategies" (lecture, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 9 February 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying graph shows the offspring-produced and offspring-forgone curves for an iteroparous organism:  
[[File:reproductive effort semelparous.jpg|thumb|right|Semelparous reproductive effort]]

In the first graph, the [[marginal cost]] of offspring produced is decreasing (each additional offspring is less "expensive" than the average of all previous offspring) and the marginal cost of offspring forgone is increasing.  In this situation, the organism only devotes a portion of its resources to reproduction, and uses the rest of its resources on growth and survivorship so that it can reproduce again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Roff, Derek A. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Springer {{ISBN|0-412-02391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also possible (second graph) for the marginal cost of offspring produced to ''increase'', and for the marginal cost of offspring forgone to decrease.  When this is the case, it is favorable for the organism to reproduce a single time. The organism devotes all of its resources to that one episode of reproduction, so it then dies. This mathematical/graphical model has found only limited quantitative support from nature.

===Bet-hedging models===
A second set of models examines the possibility that iteroparity is a [[Bet-hedging (biology)|hedge]] against unpredictable juvenile survivorship (avoiding putting all one's eggs in one basket).  Again, mathematical models have not found empirical support from real-world systems.  In fact, many semelparous species live in habitats characterized by high (not low) environmental unpredictability, such as deserts and early successional habitats.

===Cole's paradox and demographic models===

The models that have the strongest support from living systems are demographic. In Lamont Cole's classic 1954 paper, he came to the conclusion that: {{Quote|For an annual species, the absolute gain in intrinsic population growth which could be achieved by changing to the perennial reproductive habit would be exactly equivalent to adding one individual to the average litter size.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont C. Cole. "The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 29, no. 2 (June 1954): 103-137&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For example, imagine two species—an iteroparous species that has annual litters averaging three offspring each, and a semelparous species that has one litter of four, and then dies.  These two species have the same rate of population growth, which suggests that even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. This is known as Cole's paradox.

In his analysis, Cole assumed that there was no mortality of individuals of the iteroparous species, even seedlings. Twenty years later, Charnov and Schaffer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charnov | first1 = E.L. | last2 = Schaffer | first2 = W.M. | year = 1973 | title = Life history consequences of natural selection: Cole's result revisited | url = http://repository.unm.edu/bitstream/1928/1696/2/AN1973.pdf| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 791–793 | doi=10.1086/282877}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reasonable differences in adult and juvenile mortality yield much more reasonable costs of semelparity, essentially solving Cole's paradox.  An even more general demographic model was produced by Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1981 | title = A general model of comparative fecundity for semelparous and iteroparous life histories | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 27–36 | doi=10.1086/283798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These demographic models have been more successful than the other models when tested with real-world systems. It has been shown that semelparous species have higher expected adult mortality, making it more economical to put all reproductive effort into the first (and therefore final) reproductive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1990 | title = The evolution of semelparity in Mount Kenya lobelias | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 157–171 | doi=10.1007/bf02270913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesica | first1 = P. | last2 = Young | first2 = T.P. | year = 2005 | title = Demographic model explains life history evolution in Arabis fecunda | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 471–477 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00972.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Dasyuridae ====

===== Small Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Phascogale calura close.jpg|thumb|''Phascogale calura'']]
Semelparous species of [[Dasyuridae]] are typically small and carnivorous, with the exception of the northern quoll (''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]''), which is large. Species with this reproductive strategy include members of the genus&amp;nbsp;''[[Antechinus]],&amp;nbsp;[[Brush-tailed phascogale|Phascogale tapoatafa]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''[[Red-tailed phascogale|Phascogale culura]]''. The males of all three groups exhibit similar characteristics that classify them as semelparous. First, all of the males of each species disappear immediately after the mating season. Also, males that are captured and isolated from others live for 2 to 3 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Patricia|date=1966-01-01|title=Reproduction in Antechinus spp. and other Dasyurid marsupials|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282331976_Reproduction_in_Antechinus_spp_and_other_Dasyurid_marsupials|journal=Symposia of the Zoological Society of London|volume=15|pages=281–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these captured males are allowed to mate, they die immediately after the mating season, like those in the wild. Their behavior also changes drastically before and after the mating season. Before mating, males are extremely aggressive and will fight with other males if placed close together. Males that are captured before they are allowed to mate remain aggressive through the winter months. After the mating season, if allowed to mate, males become extremely lethargic and never regain their aggressiveness even if they survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other changes that occur post-mating include fur degradation and testicular degeneration. During adolescence, male fur is thick and becomes dull and thin after mating, but regains its original condition if the individual manages to survive past the mating season. The fur on the scrotum completely falls off and does not grow back, even if the male survives months after the first mating season. As the marsupial ages, its testicles grow until they reach a peak size and weight at the beginning of the mating season. After the individual mates, the weight and size of the testes and scrotum decrease. They remain small and do not produce&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]&amp;nbsp;later in life, if maintained in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1966 Woolley study on&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus spp.''&amp;nbsp;noticed that males were only able to be maintained past mating in the laboratory and no senile males were found in the wild, suggesting that all males die shortly after mating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Corticosteroid concentration and increased male mortality =====

[[File:Antechinus stuartii.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus stuartii'']]
Studies on&amp;nbsp;''[[Brown antechinus|Antechinus stuartii]]''&amp;nbsp;reveal that male mortality is highly correlated to stress and&amp;nbsp;[[Adrenocortical hormone|andrenocortica]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l activity. The study measured the&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]&amp;nbsp;concentration in males in the wild, males injected with cortisol, males injected with saline, and females in the wild. While both males and females exhibit high levels of corticosteroid concentration in the wild, this proves fatal only to males due to females having a higher maximum high affinity corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A.J.|last2=McDonald|first2=I.R.|last3=Lee|first3=A.K.|title=Stress and mortality in a small marsupial (Antechinus stuartii, Macleay)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=188–200|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, free corticosteroid in the&amp;nbsp;[[Blood plasma|plasma]]&amp;nbsp;of male&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''&amp;nbsp;rises sharply, while it remains constant in females. High levels of free corticosteroid, resulting from mating in wild males and injected cortisol in laboratory males, resulted in&amp;nbsp;[[Peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhaging]], and&amp;nbsp;[[liver abscess]]es, all of which increased mortality. These side effects were not found in the males that were injected with saline,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; strengthening the hypothesis that high free corticosteroids results in higher morality in male&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids''. A similar study on&amp;nbsp;''Phascogale calura''&amp;nbsp;showed that similar&amp;nbsp;[[endocrine system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;changes happen in&amp;nbsp;''P. calura''&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A. J.|date=July 1987|title=Stress and mortality in the red-tailed phascogale, Phascogale calura (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=85–100|issn=0016-6480|pmid=3623073|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(87)90208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports stress-induced mortality as a characteristic of small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;semelparity.

===== Large Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Dasyurus hallucatus -Queensland-8.jpg|thumb|''Dasyurus hallucatus'']]
''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]'', or the northern quoll, is a large&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;and exhibits increased male mortality after the mating season. Unlike smaller&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids'', male die-off in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;is not due to endocrine system changes and there was no&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatogenesis|spermatogenic failure]]&amp;nbsp;after the mating season ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If male&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;survive past their first mating season, they may be able to engage in a second mating season. While the individuals in a 2001 study mostly died from vehicles or predation, researchers found evidence of physiological degradation in males, similar to the physiological degradation in small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids.''&amp;nbsp;This includes fur loss, parasite infestations, and weight loss. As the mating period went on, males became increasingly&amp;nbsp;[[Anemia|anemic]], but the anemia was not due to&amp;nbsp;[[ulcer]]ation&amp;nbsp;or gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lack of elevated cortisol levels during mating periods in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;means that there is no current universal explanation for the mechanism behind increased male mortality in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae.''&amp;nbsp;Post-reproductive [[senescence]]&amp;nbsp;has also been proposed as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, A. "Living slow and dying young: senescence in marsupials."&amp;nbsp;''Marsupial Biology: Recent Research, New Perspectives. University of New South Wales Press, Sydney''&amp;nbsp;(1997): 163-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In opossums ====

===== Grey slender mouse opossum (''Marmosa incana'') =====
[[File:Flickr - ggallice - Mouse opossum.jpg|thumb|''Mouse opossum'']]
The [[Marmosa|mouse opossum]] exhibits a semelparous reproductive strategy in males and females. Males disappear from their&amp;nbsp;[[Endemism|endemic area]]&amp;nbsp;after the reproductive season (February–May). Males found months later (June–August) are of lighter body weight and the molar teeth are less worn down, suggesting these males belong to a different generation. There is a drop off in the female population, but during the months of July and August, evidence of a gap between generations like the male gap. There is also lower body weight and less molar wear observed in females found after August. This is further supported by the evidence that females that reproduce are not observed the following year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lucia, Maria. "Annual age structure and reproductive patterns in Marmosa incana (Lund, 1841)(Didelphidae, Marsupialia)." (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This species has been compared to a similarly related species&amp;nbsp;''[[Robinson's mouse opossum|Marmosa robinsoni]]''&amp;nbsp;and like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana''&amp;nbsp;in order to answer what would happen if a female that has reproduced were to survive to the next mating season.&amp;nbsp;''M. robinsoni''&amp;nbsp;has a&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|monoestrus]]&amp;nbsp;reproductive cycle, like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana'', and females are no longer fertile after 17 months so it is unlikely that females that survive past the drop off in female populations would be able to reproduce a second time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Catita (Gracilinanus microtarsus) - Leonardo Merçon.jpg|thumb|''Gracilinanus microtarsus'']]
Other mouse opossums

''[[Brazilian gracile opossum|Gracilinanus microtarsus]]'', or the Brazilian gracile opossum, is considered to be partially semelparous because male mortality increases significantly after the mating season, but some males survive to mate again in the next reproductive cycle. The males also exhibit similar physiological degradation demonstrated in&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus''and other semelparous&amp;nbsp;[[marsupial]]s&amp;nbsp;such as fur loss and increase of infection from parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Eduardo G.|last2=Bonato|first2=Vinícius|last3=da-Silva|first3=Cibele Q.|last4=Reis|first4=Dos|last5=F|first5=Sérgio|date=2006-10-17|title=Partial Semelparity in the Neotropical Didelphid Marsupial Gracilinanus microtarsus|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/5/915/900694|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=87|issue=5|pages=915–920|doi=10.1644/05-mamm-a-403r1.1|issn=0022-2372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semelparity in fish ===

==== Pacific salmon ====
Highly elevated cortisol levels mediate the post-spawning death of semelparous ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' Pacific salmon by causing tissue degeneration, suppressing the immune system, and impairing various homeostatic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5|title=SALMONIDS AND ANNUAL FISHES: DEATH AFTER SEX|last=Dickhoff|first=Walton W.|pages=253–266|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After swimming for such a long distance, salmon expend all of their energy on reproduction. One of the key factors in salmon rapid [[senescence]] is that these fish do not feed during reproduction so body weight is extremely reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morbey|first=Yolanda E.|last2=Brassil|first2=Chad E.|last3=Hendry|first3=Andrew P.|title=Rapid Senescence in Pacific Salmon|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1086/491720|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=166|issue=5|pages=556–568|doi=10.1086/491720|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physiological degradation, pacific salmon become more lethargic as mating goes on, which makes some individuals more susceptible to predation because they have less energy to avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gende|first=Scott M.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas P.|last3=Hilborn|first3=Ray|last4=Hendry|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Dickerson|first5=Bobette|date=2004-03-01|title=Brown bears selectively kill salmon with higher energy content but only in habitats that facilitate choice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x/abstract|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=104|issue=3|pages=518–528|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x|issn=1600-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also increases mortality rates of adults post-mating.

=== Semelparity in insects ===
[[File:Gypsy Moth (35955436354).jpg|thumb|Gypsy Moth]]
Traditionally,&amp;nbsp;semelparity was usually defined within the time frame of a year. Critics of this criterion note that this scale is inappropriate in discussing patterns of insect reproduction because many insects breed more than once within one annual period, but generation times of less than one year. Under the traditional definition, insects are considered semelparous as a consequence of time scale rather than the distribution of reproductive effort over their adult life span.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Robert S.|last2=Stamp|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Halverson|first3=Timothy G.|date=1982|title=Iteroparity and Semelparity in Insects|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=120|issue=2|pages=264–268|doi=10.1086/283987|jstor=2461222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve this inconsistency, Fritz ''et. al'' define semelparous insects as "Insects that lay a single [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch of eggs]] in their lifetime and deposit them at one place are clearly semelparous or big bang reproducers. Their entire reproductive effort is committed at one time and they die shortly after [[Oviparity|oviposition]]".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Semelparous insects are found in [[Lepidoptera]], [[Mayfly|Ephemeroptera]], [[Earwig|Dermaptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Strepsiptera]], [[Caddisfly|Trichoptera]], and [[Homoptera]].

==== Examples in Lepidoptera ====
Females of certain families of Lepidoptera, like the [[Lymantria dispar|Gypsy Moth]] of ''[[Bagworm moth|Psychidae]],'' have reduced mobility or [[Aptery|apterous]] so the insects' dispersal is in the larval stage, as opposed to in the adult stage. In iteroparous insects, major dispersal occurs in the adult stage. All semelparous Lepidopterans share similar characteristics: Larva only feed in restricted periods of the year because of the nutritional state of their host plants (as a result, they are [[univoltine]]), initial food supply is predictably abundant, and larval host plants are abundant and adjacent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Death most commonly occurs by starvation. In the case of the gypsy moth, adults do not possess an active digestive system and cannot feed, but can drink moisture. Mating occurs fairly rapidly after adults emerge from their [[pupa]]l form and, without a way to digest food, the adult moths die after about a week.&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary advantages to semelparity ==

=== Current evolutionary advantages hypothesis ===
[[File:Agile Antechinus (Antechinus agilis) showing offspring inside.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus agilis'' showing offspring inside pouch]]
The evolution for semelparity in both sexes has occurred many times in plants, invertebrates, and fish. It is rare in mammals because mammals have obligate maternal care due to&amp;nbsp;[[internal fertilization]]&amp;nbsp;and incubation of offspring and nursing young after birth, which requires high maternal survival rate after fertilization and offspring&amp;nbsp;[[weaning]]. Also, female mammals have relatively low reproductive rate compared to invertebrates or fish because they invest a lot of energy in maternal care. However, male reproductive rate is much less constrained in mammals because only females bear young. Males that die after one mating season can still produce a large number of offspring if he invests all of his energy in intense matings with many females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Diana O.|last2=Dickman|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Jones|first3=Menna E.|last4=Blomberg|first4=Simon P.|date=2013-10-29|title=Sperm competition drives the evolution of suicidal reproduction in mammals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17910|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=44|pages=17910–17914|doi=10.1073/pnas.1310691110|issn=0027-8424|pmid=24101455|pmc=3816400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in mammals ====
Scientists have hypothesized that natural selection has allowed semelparity to evolved in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''Didelphidae''&amp;nbsp;because of certain ecological constraints. Female mammals ancestral to this these groups may have shortened their mating period to coincide with peak prey abundance. Because this window is so small, the females of these species exhibit a reproduction pattern where the&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|estrous]]&amp;nbsp;of all females occurs simultaneously. Selection would then favor aggressive males due to increased competition between males for access to females. Since the mating period is so short, it is more beneficial for males to expend all their energy on mating, even more so if they are unlikely to survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Anthony K.|date=1979|title=A Mammalian Example of Semelparity|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113|issue=1|pages=151–155|doi=10.1086/283372|jstor=2459950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in fish ====
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|Dead salmon after spawning]]
Reproduction is costly for [[Fish migration|anadromous]] [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] because their life history requires transition from saltwater to freshwater streams and long migrations, which can be physiologically taxing. The transition between cold oceanic water to warm freshwater and steep elevation changes in Northern Paciﬁc rivers could explain the evolution of semelparity because it would be extremely difficult to return to the ocean. A noticeable difference between semelparous fish and iteroparous salmonids is that egg size varies between the two types of reproductive strategies. Studies show that egg size is also affected by migration and body size. Egg number, however shows little variation between semelparous and iteroparous populations or between resident and anadromous populations for females of the same body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/ele.12607/abstract|doi=10.1111/ele.12607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current hypothesis behind this reason is that iteroparous species reduce the size of their eggs in order to improve the mother's chances survival, since she invests less energy in gamete formation. Semelparous species do not expect to live past one mating season, so females invest a lot more energy in gamete formation resulting in large eggs. Anadromous salmonids may also have evolved semelparity to boost the nutrition density of the [[Spawn (biology)|spawning grounds]]. The most productive Pacific salmon spawning grounds contain the most carcasses of spawned adults. The dead bodies of the adult salmon decompose and provide nitrogen and phosphorus for [[algae]] to grow in the nutrient-poor water. [[Zooplankton]] then feed on the algae, and newly-hatched salmon feed on the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7|title=Freshwaters of Alaska|last=Kline|first=Thomas C.|last2=Goering|first2=John J.|last3=Piorkowski|first3=Robert J.|date=1997|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781461268666|series=Ecological Studies|pages=179–204|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in insects ====
[[File:Earwig guarding eggs.jpg|thumb|Earwig guarding eggs]]
An interesting trait has evolved in semelparous insects, especially in those that have evolved from [[Parasitism|parasitic]] ancestors, like in all subsocial and [[Eusocial insect|eusocial]] [[Aculeata|aculeate]] [[Hymenoptera]]. This is because larvae are morphologically specialized for development within a host's innards and thus are entirely helpless outside of that environment. Females would need to invest a lot of energy in protecting their eggs and hatched offspring. They do this through such behaviors as egg guarding. Mothers that actively defend offspring, for example, risk injury or death by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TALLAMY|first=DOUGLAS W.|last2=BROWN|first2=WILLIAM P.|title=Semelparity and the evolution of maternal care in insects|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=727–730|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not beneficial in an iteroparous species because the female risks dying and not reaching her full reproductive potential by not being able to reproduce in all reproductive periods in her lifetime. Since semelparous insects only live for one reproductive cycle, they can afford to expend energy on maternal care because those offspring are her only offspring. An iteroparous insect does not need to expend energy on the eggs of one mating period because it is likely that she will mate again. There is ongoing research in maternal care in semelparous insects from lineages not descended from parasites to further understand this relationship between semelparity and maternal care.

'''Shangri-La''' is a fictional place described in the 1933 [[novel]] ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] – a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of [[the Orient]].

In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.&lt;ref name="National Park brochure"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra
|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park &amp; Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).

==Etymology==
The phrase "Shangri-La" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|ཞང་}}'',"Shang" – a district of [[Ü-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Das – Tibetan English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;" + ''{{lang|bo|རི}}'', pronounced "ri", "Mountain" = "Shang Mountain" + ''{{lang|bo|ལ}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, "Shang Mountain Pass".

While the name Shangri-La is of relatively recent origin, the concept previously existed.
* Some scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jewish sources describe a city named [[Luz]], "in which the angel of death has no permission to enter for a thousand years: its citizens have the ability to live forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/between-luz-and-beit-el-power-transformational-moments
|title=Between Luz And Beit El: The Power of Transformational Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same description is given for a location named ''Kushta'' - based on the [[Aramaic]] word for truth. In this city, the only reason for death was if a person told an untruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Academic scholars have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Peter (1989).

In China, the poet [[Tao Yuanming]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420&amp;nbsp;CE) described a kind of Shangri-La in his work ''[[The Peach Blossom Spring|The Tale of the Peach Blossom Spring]]'' ({{zh|t=桃花源記|p=Táohuā Yuán Jì}}). The story goes that there was a fisherman from [[Wuling]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}}, who came across a beautiful peach grove, and he discovered happy and content people who lived completely cut off from the troubles in the outside world since the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–207&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="Peach Colony"&gt;{{cite web

[[Shambhala]] is a core concept in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that describes a realm of harmony between man and nature that is also connected with the Kalachakra or "wheel of time". The Shambhala ideal is described in detail in the [[Shambhala Sutra]], a historical text written by the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth Panchen Lama (1737–1780)]] which describes some of the Shambhala locations as being in [[Ngari]], the western prefecture of [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition&gt;[[Laurence Brahm|Brahm, Laurence]]. (2004). ''Shambhala Sutrah'' (film expedition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore from the [[Altai Mountains]] describe [[Gora Belukha|Mount Belukha]] as a gateway to [[Shambhala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/mysteries-kingdom-shambhala-001529|title=Mysteries of the Kingdom of Shambhala|first=|last=aprilholloway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kun Lun Mountains]] (崑崙山) offer another possible place for valleys like the Shangri-La, since Hilton specifically described the “Kuen-Lun” mountains as its likely location in the book, however, Hilton is not known to have visited or studied the area.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Parts of the [[Kun Lun Mountains|Kun Lun]] lie within [[Ngari]], mentioned in the [[Shambhala]] Sutra.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"/&gt;

===Possible sources for Hilton===
In a ''New York Times'' interview in 1936, Hilton states that he used "Tibetan material" from the [[British Museum]], particularly the travelogue of two French priests, [[Evariste Regis Huc]] and [[Joseph Gabet]], to provide the Tibetan cultural and Buddhist spiritual inspiration for Shangri-La.&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;Michael McRae. (2002). ''The Siege of Shangri-La: The Quest for Tibet's Sacred Hidden Paradise''. New York: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;B.R. Crisler. (1936). Film gossip of the week. ''The New York Times'', 26&amp;nbsp;July 1936, section&amp;nbsp;9, page&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Huc and Gabet travelled a roundtrip between Beijing and Lhasa in 1844–1846 on a route more than {{convert|250|km}} north of Yunnan. Their famous travelogue, first published in French in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc. (1850). ''Souvenirs d'un&amp;nbsp;voyage dans la&amp;nbsp;Tartarie, le&amp;nbsp;Thibet et la&amp;nbsp;Chine pendant les&amp;nbsp;annees 1844, 1845, et 1846''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; went through many editions in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Mille. (1953). A selective survey of literature on Tibet. ''American Political Science Review'', 47&amp;nbsp;(4): 1135–1151.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular "condensed translation" was published in England in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc &amp; Joseph Gabet. (1928). ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China, 1844–1846''. Edited and translated by William Hazlitt. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time that Hilton would have been gathering inspiration for – or perhaps writing – ''Lost Horizon''.

===Current claimants===
Today various places, such as parts of southern [[Kham]] in northwestern [[Yunnan]] province, including the tourist destinations of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and Zhongdian, claim the title. In modern China, [[Zhongdian]] county was renamed Xiānggélǐlā (香格里拉, Shangri-La in Chinese) in 2001, to attract tourists.

Hilton visited the [[Hunza Valley]] in northern [[Pakistan]], close to the Chinese border, a few years before ''Lost Horizon'' was published; hence it is a popularly believed inspiration for Hilton's physical description of Shangri-La.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shangri-la Valley |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-29 |publisher=Adventure Tours Pakistan |url=http://www.atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083212/http://atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel; also, in an ironic reversal on the story, due to increased exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation, inhabitants of the high-altitude parts of the valley appear to age quickly.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, because the Hunza Valley does not have [[Tibetan culture]] and lacks Buddhist religion, it could not have been the inspiration for the cultural context for Hilton's [[Lost Horizon|story]].

Places like [[Sichuan]] and [[Tibet]] also claim the real Shangri-La was in its{{where|date=January 2014}} territory. In 2001, [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] put forward a proposal that the three regions optimise all Shangri-La tourism resources and promote them as one. After failed attempts to establish a China Shangri-la Ecological Tourism Zone in 2002 and 2003, government representatives of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region signed a declaration of co-operation in 2004. Also in 2001, [[Zhongdian]] County in northwestern [[Yunnan]] officially renamed itself [[Shangri-La County]].

===Recent searches and documentaries===
American explorers [[Ted Vaill]] and [[Peter Klika]] visited the [[Muli Tibetan Autonomous County|Muli]] area of southern [[Sichuan Province]] in 1999, and claimed that the Muli [[monastery]] in this remote region was the model for James Hilton's Shangri-La, which they thought Hilton learned about from articles on this area in several ''National Geographic'' magazine articles in the late 1920s and early 1930s written by Austrian-American explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/1402958/Could-this-be-the-way-to-Shangri-La.html "Could This Be the Way to Shangri-La?"] by Timothy Carroll (29&amp;nbsp;July 2002). ''Electronic Telegraph''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaill completed a film based on their research, "Finding Shangri-La", which debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column where he reveals his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La and, if it is any place, it is more than 250&amp;nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.&lt;ref name="McRae"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Between 2002–2004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;

On 2&amp;nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, "Life in Shangri-La", in which Yan said that "Shangri-La" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops, local farmers as they harvest crops, and sampled their cuisine.

Television presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.
The Travel Channel recently aired an episode of Expedition Unknown that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas in search of Shangri-La. His findings are not necessarily proof that Shangri-La is or was real. However, the sky caves that are found do represent some interesting facts.

[[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" contains the following lyrics: "Like Shangri-La beneath the summer moon / I will return again / As the dust that floats finds you / We're movin' through Kashmir."

"Shangri-La" is a song written by Ray Davies of The Kinks. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]''. The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.

Shangri-La also appears in the Oasis song "Idler's Dream", B-side to ''[[The Hindu Times]]''. The lyrics appear as: 
"And as I close my eyes,
And the sky turns red
I realise just what you are.
You're an idler's dream,
and you're singing Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la."

"Going to Shangri-La" is a song from Atlanta Rhythm Section

“This is Shangri-La” is a song on the album [[Apple (album)|''Apple'']] by [[Mother Love Bone]]. 

"Shangri-La" is a track on Billy Idol's 1993 album ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]''.

[[The Wraith: Shangri-La|''The Wraith: Shangri-La'']] is an album by the rap duo the [[Insane Clown Posse]].

"Helsinki–Shangri-La" is a 2010 single of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rapper]] [[Paleface (Finnish musician)|Paleface]].

"Shangri-La" is the final track on the album ''[[A New World Record]]'' by [[ELO]].

Electro-Acoustic Harpist and multi-instrumentalist, Gary Edward Drum, released his composition: "ENTERING SHANGRI-LA" on his 2013 album: ''The Utopia Within''.&lt;ref&gt;The Utopia Within by Gary Drum, July 8, 2013, Harpa Magica Unlimited&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 15 May 2017, Korean boyband [[VIXX]] released their song "Shangri-La" together with their 4th mini album, which has the same name.

The AC/DC song "Sin City" on the 1978 ''Powerage'' album, Shangri-la is mentioned with the lyrics "Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangrila"

Shangri-La is mentioned in the song “[[Dr. Feelgood (song)|Dr. Feelgood]]” by [[Mötley Crüe]], from the album of the same name. Shangri-La is included in the lyric “He’ll tell you he’s the king of these Barrio streets, movin’ up to Shangri-La”.

[[Stevie Nicks]]’ solo album ''[[Trouble in Shangri-La]]'' was released on May 1, 2001. Cover art features an oriental setting showing Nicks with her back to the camera looking out over an ocean.

English rock band [[Arctic Monkeys]] mentioned Shangri-La in the song "[[Suck It and See]]", from their fourth studio album, released on 6 June 2011 by Domino Recording Company. The lyrics appear as: 
"Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh"

==Usage==
Shangri-La is often used in a similar context to "[[Garden of Eden]]," to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive that is much sought. For a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's "Shangri-La." It also might be used to represent perfection that is sought by man in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of somewhat similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''''Shòu''''' ({{zh|s=寿|t=壽|p={{audio|Zh-shòu.ogg|shòu|help=no}}}}) is the Chinese word/character for "longevity".

== Use ==
Three of the most important goals in life in Chinese traditional thought are the propitious blessings of happiness (''fú'' 福), professional success or prosperity (''lù'' 禄), and longevity (''shòu'' 寿). These are visually represented by the three "star gods" of the same names ([[Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']]), commonly depicted as three male figurines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duda |first=Margaret |title=Traditional Chinese  Toggles |publisher=EDM |year=2011 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (each wearing a distinctive garment and holding an object that enables them to be differentiated), or the Chinese ideographs/characters themselves, or various homophones or objects with relevant attributes. ''Shòu'' is instantly recognizable. "He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate ''fu'' happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity."&lt;ref name=werner431&gt;{{cite book |last=Werner |first=E. T. C. |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Mythology |publisher=Kelly and Walsh |year=1932 |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title "Longevity Star Old-pate".&lt;ref name=werner431 /&gt;

The Chinese character ''shòu'' (寿) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry, generally in its more complex ideograph (壽), but also in its simplified (post-1950) form (寿). The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. 

Longevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (''wǔfú'' 五福 - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Terese Tse |title=Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art |publisher=Asian Art Museum of San Francisco |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are often depicted in the [[homophone|homophonous]] rendition of five flying [[bat]]s because the word for "[[bat]]" in Chinese (''fú'' 蝠) sounds like the word for [[Fu character|"good fortune" or "happiness"]] or in this case, "blessings".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In this arrangement, the ''shòu'' ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat.

Other symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include [[Pine|pine trees]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], spotted deer, special collectors' stones (''shòushí'' 寿石), [[peach]]es, and [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, pp. 204-6&lt;/ref&gt; These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees).  

Perhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: ''shòu shān fú hǎi'' (寿山福海), which can be translated as "May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas".

Since 2017, the version 10 of the [[Unicode]] Standard features a rounded version of the symbol in the "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU).&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 10.0, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-10.0/U100-1F200.pdf|website=unicode.org|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In names===
As a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]] in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is '''Kotobuki''' 寿 (see [[Nakajima Kotobuki]], [[Tsukasa Kotobuki]]). See also [[Jurōjin]] (Shou Laoren) and [[Fukurokuju]].

'''Mark Howard James''' (born October 16, 1961) professionally known as '''The 45 King''' (also known as ''DJ Mark the 45 King''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 45 king addressing his stage name|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGsyuKKlPxU&amp;t=15s|website=The 45 King's official YouTube channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[record producer]] and [[disc jockey]] (DJ) from [[The Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]]. James began DJing in [[New Jersey]], in the mid-1980s. His [[pseudonym]], the 45 King, came from his ability to make beats using obscure [[45 record|45 RPM records]].

==Career==
The 45 King first gained fame with his [[breakbeat]] track "The 900 Number" in 1987. The song featured a looping of a [[baritone sax]] solo from [[Marva Whitney]]'s "Unwind Yourself" (1968). The 45 King signed with [[Tuff City Records]] that year and given a production deal. "The 900 Number" remains his signature work, having been resampled by many artists. He was also featured on the ''1989-Hustlers Convention'' album on the UK label Music of Life, which is considered by many{{Who|date=April 2011}} to be hip-hop's first-ever live album.

Using his popularity from the previous release, the 45 King was able to help the other members of his crew, dubbed the [[Flavor Unit]], which included many well-known hip-hop acts including [[Chill Rob G]], [[Lakim Shabazz]], [[Apache (rapper)|Apache]], and [[Queen Latifah]]. The 45 King's big break came when Queen Latifah signed with [[Tommy Boy Records]] in 1989 and released the album ''[[All Hail the Queen]]''. The 45 King did extensive production on this album, and it is considered by critics{{Who|date=April 2011}} to be among his best production work. Over the next few years, many other Flavor Unit members also signed with Tommy Boy, and the 45 King frequently contributed to their albums with his productions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In November 1989, the re-release of "The King is Here" / "The 900 Number" peaked at #60 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], his only appearance in a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[record chart|chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

| isbn= 1-904994-10-5
| page= 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, [[drug addiction]] took its toll on the 45 King's career, which caused him to lose a production deal that he signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Around this time the 45 King released multiple series of breakbeat records (the ''Lost Breakbeat'' series, the ''Breakapalooza'' series, etc.) and remixed Madonna's Top-10 single "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", but he stayed mainly with his breakbeat record franchises.

In July 1990, Manchester-born DJ [[Chad Jackson (DJ)|Chad Jackson]] sampled "The 900 Number" on his single "[[Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)]]", which reached #3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 2"&gt;{{cite book

| page= 273}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remixed version was also a minor UK hit in 2007. Jackson was apparently unaware that the song had itself been sampled from the original "Unwind Yourself", as he credited himself, and King, as co-writers of the song.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1996, [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[Go-go music|go-go]] artist DJ [[DJ Kool]] had a hit with the song "[[Let Me Clear My Throat]]". It was a call-and-response vocals over a chopped half of the "900 Number" beat. DJ Kool did not just sample the track: he also acknowledged the 45 King's as the song's originator, and the 45 King remixed the track for Kool.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1998, the 45 King produced "[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]" for [[Jay-Z]]. The song was a hit that featured a looped chorus from the original cast album of the Broadway musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. Jay-Z also did an interview when he spoke about how important the 45 King has been to hip hop music and considers him a true pioneer of the business. In 2000, he produced the platinum-certified track "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" for [[Eminem]].

[[File:Wandering jew.jpg|thumb|''The Wandering Jew '' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

The '''Wandering Jew''' is a mythical [[Immortality|immortal]] man whose [[legend]] began to spread in Europe in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;as described in the first chapter of ''Curious Myths of the Middle Ages'' where [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] attributed the earliest extant mention of the myth of the Wandering Jew to [[Matthew Paris]]. The chapter began with a reference to [[Gustave Doré]]'s series of twelve illustrations to the legend, and ended with a sentence remarking that, while the original legend was so 'noble in its severe simplicity' that few could develop it with success in poetry or otherwise, Doré had produced in this series 'at once a poem, a romance, and a chef-d'œuvre of art'. First published in two parts in 1866 and 1868, the work was republished in 1877 and in many other editions.[https://archive.org/stream/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original legend concerns a [[Jew]] who taunted [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] on the way to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and was then cursed to walk the earth until the [[Second Coming]]. The exact nature of the wanderer's indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale, as do aspects of his character; sometimes he is said to be a [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]] or other tradesman, while sometimes he is the doorman at [[Pontius Pilate]]'s estate.

==Name==
The earliest extant manuscript with the legend is the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' by [[Roger of Wendover]], where it appears in the part for the year 1228, under the title ''Of the Jew Joseph who is still alive awaiting the last coming of Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQNIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513] (Latin, ''De Joseph, qui ultimum Christi adventum adhuc vivus exspectat'') p.175 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G-4sAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA157] and {{harvnb|Jacobs|1911|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least from the 17th century the name ''Ahasver'' has been given to the Wandering Jew, apparently adapted from [[Ahasuerus]], the Persian king in the [[Book of Esther]], who was not a Jew, and whose very name among medieval Jews was an ''[[exemplum]]'' of a fool.&lt;ref&gt;David Daube, "Ahasver" ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'' New Series '''45'''.3 (January 1955), pp 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; This name may have been chosen because the [[Book of Esther]] describes the Jews as a persecuted people, scattered across every province of Ahasuerus' [[Achaemenid Empire|vast empire]], similar to the later [[Jewish diaspora]] in countries whose state and/or majority religions were forms of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/person/334,ahasverus-wandering-jew-ahasver-/|title=Ahasver, Ahasverus, Wandering Jew - People - Virtual Shtetl|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112000405/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/person/334,ahasverus-wandering-jew-ahasver-/|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of names have since been given to the Wandering Jew, including ''Matathias'', ''Buttadeus'', ''Paul Marrane'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy|The Turkish Spy]]|year=1644|volume=Book 3, Letter I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Isaac Laquedem'' which is a name for him in France and the [[Low Countries]], in popular legend as well as in a novel by [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]].

Where [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] are spoken, the emphasis has been on the perpetual character of his punishment, and thus he is known there as ''Ewiger Jude'' and ''vechny zhid'' (вечный жид), the "Eternal Jew". In French and other [[Latin languages]], the usage has been to refer to the wanderings, as in French "le Juif errant", in Spanish "el judío errante"&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Judío errante]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}} or in Italian "l'ebreo errante"&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Ebreo errante]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}} and this has been followed in English from the Middle Ages, as the ''Wandering Jew''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|1911|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] he is known as ''Jerusalemin suutari'' (Shoemaker of Jerusalem), implying he was a [[wikt:cobbler|cobbler]] by his trade.

==Origin and evolution==

===Biblical sources===
The origins of the legend are uncertain; perhaps one element is the story in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], who is issued with a similar punishment&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to wander over the earth, scavenging and never reaping, although without the related punishment of endlessness. According to Jehoshua Gilboa, many commentators have pointed to Hosea 9:17 as a statement of the notion of the "eternal/wandering Jew".&lt;ref name="SweeneyCotter2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sweeney|first1=Marvin Alan|last2=Cotter|first2=David W. |last3=Walsh|first3=Jerome T.|author4=Franke, Chris|title=The Twelve Prophets: Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOwFysWpogC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=October 2000|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5095-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some sources, the legend stems from Jesus' words given in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:28|16:28]]:

{{quote|{{Lang|grc|Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, εἰσίν τινες ὧδε ἑστῶτες, οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου, ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενον ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ.}}

Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] coming in his kingdom. ([[New International Version]])

Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.|[[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]&lt;ref&gt;This verse is quoted in the German pamphlet ''Kurtze Beschreibung und Erzählung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus'', 1602.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A belief that the [[disciple whom Jesus loved]] would not die was apparently popular enough in the early Christian world to be denounced in the [[Gospel of John]]:

{{quote|And Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following whom Jesus loved, who had also leaned on His breast at the supper, and had said, Lord, which is he who betrayeth Thee? When, therefore, Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall he do? Jesus saith to him, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me. Then this saying went forth among the brethren, that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus had not said to him that he would not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?|John 21:20-23, KJV}}

Another passage in the Gospel of John speaks about a guard of the high priest who slaps Jesus (John 18:19-23). Earlier, the Gospel of John talks about Simon Peter striking the ear from a servant of the high priest, named [[Malchus]] (John 18:10). Although this servant is probably not the same guard who struck Jesus, Malchus is nonetheless one of the many names given to the wandering Jew in later legend.&lt;ref name="Italian popular tales"&gt;{{cite book|title=Italian Popular Tales|author=Thomas Frederick Crane|publisher=Macmillan|year=1885|location=page 197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kFdaz7OVT8C&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hirszenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Wandering Jew by [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1899).]]

===Early Christianity===
Extant manuscripts have shown that as early as the time of [[Tertullian]] (c. 200), some Christian proponents were likening the Jewish people to a "new Cain", asserting that they would be "fugitives and wanderers (upon) the earth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'', 18 vols., 2d ed., Columbia University Press, 1952–1983. Volume titles [https://www.amazon.com/Social-Religious-History-Wittmayer-Baron/dp/0231088566#reader_0231088566]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prudentius|Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] (b. 348) writes in his ''Apotheosis'' (c. 400): "From place to place the homeless Jew wanders in ever-shifting exile, since the time when he was torn from the abode of his fathers and has been suffering the penalty for murder, and having stained his hands with the blood of Christ whom he denied, paying the price of sin."&lt;ref name="Apotheosis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aurelius Prudentius Clemens|title=Apotheosis|url=https://archive.org/stream/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=2011-12-22|year=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval legend===
Some scholars have identified components of the legend of the Eternal Jew in Teutonic legends of the Eternal Hunter, some features of which are derived from [[Odin]] mythology.&lt;ref name="SocialReligiousHistoryOfJews_178"&gt;{{cite book|title=A social and religious history of the Jews: Citizen or alien conjurer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXVDceafeiEC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=13 December 2011|volume=11|year=1967|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08847-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In some areas the farmers arranged the rows in their fields in such a way that on Sundays the Eternal Jew might find a resting place. Elsewhere they assumed that he could rest only upon a plough or that he had to be on the go all year and was allowed a respite only on Christmas."&lt;ref name="SocialReligiousHistoryOfJews_178" /&gt;

A variant of the Wandering Jew legend is recorded in the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' by [[Roger of Wendover]] around the year 1228.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=910n83JaIREC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Flowers+of+History#PPA512,M1 |title=Roger of Wendover's Flowers of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dv8KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;cad=0_0#PPA193,M1 |title=Flores historiarum – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 13c.expulsion of Jews see [[History of the Jews in England]] and [[Edict of Expulsion]].&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian archbishop, then visiting England, was asked by the monks of [[St Albans Abbey]] about the celebrated [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who had spoken to Jesus, and was reported to be still alive. The archbishop answered that he had himself seen such a man in Armenia, and that his name was Cartaphilus, a Jewish shoemaker, who, when Jesus stopped for a second to rest while carrying his cross, hit him, and told him "Go on quicker, Jesus! Go on quicker! Why dost Thou loiter?", to which Jesus, "with a stern countenance", is said to have replied: "I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day."&lt;!-- needs citation --&gt; The Armenian bishop also reported that Cartaphilus had since converted to Christianity and spent his wandering days [[proselytize|proselytizing]] and leading a [[hermit]]'s life.

[[Matthew Paris]] included this passage from Roger of Wendover in his own history; and other Armenians appeared in 1252 at the Abbey of St Albans, repeating the same story, which was regarded there as a great proof of the truth of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Paris, ''Chron. Majora'', ed. [[H. R. Luard]], London, 1880, v. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt; The same Armenian told the story at [[Tournai]] in 1243, according to the ''[[Chronicles of Phillip Mouskes]]'', (chapter ii. 491, Brussels, 1839). After that, [[Guido Bonatti]] writes people saw the Wandering Jew in [[Forlì]] (Italy), in the 13th century; other people saw him in Vienna and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1991), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of the doomed sinner, forced to wander without the hope of rest in death till the second coming of Christ, impressed itself upon the popular medieval imagination, mainly with reference to the seeming immortality of the wandering Jewish people. These two aspects of the legend are represented in the different names given to the central figure. In German-speaking countries and [[Russia]] he is referred to as ''{{lang|de|Der Ewige Jude}}'' (the immortal, or eternal, Jew) and ''{{lang|ru-Latn|vechnyy zhid}}'' ({{lang|ru|вечный жид}}), while in Romance-speaking countries he is known as ''{{lang|fr|Le Juif Errant}}''  and ''{{lang|it|L'Ebreo Errante}}'' (French and Italian for ''the Wandering Jew''); the English form, probably because it is derived from the French, has followed the Romance. As well as ''{{lang|es|El Judío Errante}}'' (The Wandering Jew), he is known in Spanish as ''{{lang|es|Juan [el que] Espera a Dios}}'', (John [who] waits for God).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

There were claims of sightings of the Wandering Jew throughout Europe, since at least 1542 in [[Hamburg]] up to 1868 in [[Harts Corner, New Jersey|Harts Corners]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial Summary", ''Deseret News'', 23 September 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jacobs]], writing in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1911), commented "It is difficult to tell in any one of these cases how far the story is an entire fiction and how far some ingenious impostor took advantage of the existence of the myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |last=Jacobs |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Jacobs |wstitle=Jew, The Wandering |volume=15 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged by an 1881 writer, who however cites no instances, that the supposed presence of the Wandering Jew has occasionally been used as a [[pretext]] for incursions by Gentiles into [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]]s during the late Middle Ages, when the legend was accepted as fact.&lt;ref name="Conway1881"&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Moncure Daniel |title=The Wandering Jew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkMKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |year=1881 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |page=28 |quote=The animus of the revival of the legend is shown by instances in which the Jews' quarters were invaded under rumours that they were concealing the Wanderer. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend about Jews, the so-called "[[Red Jews]]", was similarly common in Central Europe in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voß|first=Rebekka|date=04/2012|title=Entangled Stories: The Red Jews in Premodern Yiddish and German Apocalyptic Lore|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ajs-review/article/entangled-stories-the-red-jews-in-premodern-yiddish-and-german-apocalyptic-lore/5D9E1A03C7776E7E124F000E761E2247|journal=AJS Review|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–41|doi=10.1017/S0364009412000013|issn=1475-4541|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

===17th and 18th centuries===
The legend became more popular after it appeared in a 17th-century pamphlet of four leaves, {{lang|de|Kurtze Beschreibung und Erzählung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus}} (Short Description and Tale of a Jew with the Name Ahasuerus).&lt;ref&gt;This professes to have been printed at [[Leiden]] in 1602 by an otherwise unrecorded printer "Christoff Crutzer"; the real place and printer can not be ascertained.&lt;/ref&gt; "Here we are told that some fifty years before, a bishop met him in a church at Hamburg, repentant, ill-clothed and distracted at the thought of having to move on in a few weeks."&lt;ref&gt;Daube 1955:244.&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[urban legend]]s, particularities lend verisimilitude: the bishop is specifically [[Paul von Eitzen|Paulus von Eitzen]], [[List of the bishops of Schleswig#Lutheran bishops and superintendents|General Superintendent of Schleswig]]. The legend spread quickly throughout Germany, no less than eight different editions appearing in 1602; altogether forty appeared in Germany before the end of the 18th century. Eight editions in Dutch and Flemish are known; and the story soon passed to France, the first French edition appearing in [[Bordeaux]], 1609, and to England, where it appeared in the form of a parody in 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs and Wolf, ''Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica'', p. 44, No. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was translated also into [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; and the expression "eternal Jew" is current in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and German, ''{{lang|de|der Ewige Jude}}''. Apparently the pamphlets of 1602 borrowed parts of the descriptions of the wanderer from reports (most notably by [[Balthasar Russow]]) about an itinerant preacher called Jürgen.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Jürgen, ''{{lang|de|2=[https://www.etis.ee/ShowFile.aspx?FileVID=39465Jürgen und der Ewige Jude. Ein lebender Heiliger wird unsterblich]}}'', Arv. Nordic Yearbook of Folklore 64 (2008), 125–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the Wandering Jew appeared in [[Simon Tyssot de Patot]]'s ''{{lang|fr|La Vie, les Aventures et le Voyage de Groenland du Révérend Père Cordelier Pierre de Mésange}}'' (1720).

In England the Wandering Jew makes an appearance in one of the secondary plots in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]'s Gothic novel ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796). The Wandering Jew is depicted as an exorcist whose origin remains unclear. The Wandering Jew also plays a role in ''[[St. Leon (novel)|St. Leon]]'' (1799) by [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Austin Flanders,
''Godwin and Gothicism: St. Leon''. Texas Studies in Literature and Language
Vol. 8, No. 4 (Winter 1967), pp. 533-545.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wandering Jew also appears in two English [[broadside ballad]]s of the 17th and 18th centuries, ''[[The Wandering Jew (ballad)|The Wandering Jew]]'', and ''[[The Wandering Jew's Chronicle]]''. The former recounts the biblical story of the Wandering Jew's encounter with Christ, while the latter tells, from the point of view of the titular character, the succession of English monarchs from William the Conqueror through either King Charles II (in the 17th century text) or King George II and Queen Caroline (in the 18th-century version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=English Broadside Ballad Archive |title=The Wandering Jew |url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/33903/album |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=English Broadside Ballad Archive |title=The Wandering Jew's Chronicle |url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/31447/album |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

====Britain====
In Britain a ballad with the title ''The Wandering Jew'' was included in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry|Reliques]]'' published in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Third edition: Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs and other pieces of our earlier poets, (chiefly of the lyric kind.) Together with some few of later date (Volume 3) - p.295-301, 128 lines of verse, with prose introduction [https://archive.org/stream/reliquesancient00dodsgoog#page/n309/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797 the operetta ''The Wandering Jew, or Love's Masquerade'' by [[Andrew Franklin]] was performed in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/f/Franklin_A/life.htm|title=Andrew Franklin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] had written a poem in four cantos with the title ''The Wandering Jew'' but it remained unpublished until 1877.&lt;ref&gt;The Wandering Jew, A Poem in Four Cantos by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Written in 1810, published posthumously for the Shelley Society by Reeves and Turner, London 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; In two other works of Shelley, Ahasuerus appears, as a phantom in his first major poem ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem]]'' (1813) and later as a hermit healer in his last major work, the verse drama [[Hellas (poem)|Hellas]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Impiety of Ahasuerus: Percy Shelley's Wandering Jew'' Tamara Tinker, revised edition 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Carlyle]], in his ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' (1834), compares its hero Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh on several occasions to the Wandering Jew, (also using the German wording ''{{lang|de|der ewige Jude}}'').

In Chapter 15 of ''Great Expectations'' (1861) by [[Charles Dickens]], the journeyman Orlick is compared to the Wandering Jew.

[[George MacDonald]] includes pieces of the legend in ''Thomas Wingfold, Curate'' (London, 1876).

The minor Cornish poet James Dryden Hosken (1861-1953) concluded "A Monk's Love" (1894) with a long poem "Ahaseurus" which he later adapted into a dramatic monologue included in his heavily revised play "Marlowe" published in "Shores of Lyonesse" 1923.

====North America====
[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s stories "A Virtuoso's Collection" and "Ethan Brand" feature the Wandering Jew serving as a guide to the stories' characters.&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], "Introduction" to ''Tales of the Wandering Jew'' edited by Stableford.Dedalus, Sawtry, 1991. {{ISBN|0-946626-71-5}} . (pp.1-25).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 a publisher in North America (Philadelphia, Gebbie) produced ''The Legend of the Wandering Jew, a series of twelve designs by [[Gustave Doré]] (Reproduced by Photographic Printing) with Explanatory Introduction.'' For each illustration there was a couplet, such as "Too late he feels, by look, and deed, and word, / How often he has crucified his Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Gebbie's edition 1873
[http://www.ebay.com/itm/LEGEND-WANDERING-JEW-1873-GUSTAVE-DORE-Illus-1ST-George-Gebbie-Pub-/120982788922?pt=Antiquarian_Collectible&amp;hash=item1c2b22db3a] A similar title was used for an edition under the imprint of Cassell, Petter &amp; Galpin, London, Paris &amp; New York.[[:File:Wandering jew title page.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 a New York publisher reprinted, under the title "Tarry Thou Till I Come", [[George Croly]]'s "Salathiel", which treated the subject in an imaginative form. It had appeared anonymously in 1828.

In [[Lew Wallace]]'s novel ''The Prince of India'', the Wandering Jew is the protagonist.  The book follows his adventures through the ages, as he takes part in the shaping of history.&lt;ref&gt;William Russo's 1999 novella ''Mal Tempo'' details Wallace's research and real-life attempt to find the mythical character for his novel. Russo also wrote a sequel, entitled ''Mal Tempo &amp; Friends'' in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; An American rabbi, [[H.M. Bien]], turned the character into the "Wandering Gentile" in his novel ''Ben-Beor: A Tale of the Anti-Messiah''; in the same year [[John L. McKeever]] wrote a novel, ''The Wandering Jew: A Tale of the Lost Tribes of Israel''.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

A humorous account of the Wandering Jew appears in chapter 54 of [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] 1869 [[travel literature|travel book]] ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark Twain |title=The Innocents Abroad |chapter=Chapter 54 |url=https://genius.com/Mark-twain-the-innocents-abroad-chap-54-annotated |accessdate=2015-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] published in 1820 a book called ''The Wandering Jew''.

====Germany====
The legend has been the subject of German [[poem]]s by [[Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart|Schubart]], [[Aloys Schreiber]], [[Wilhelm Müller]], [[Nikolaus Lenau|Lenau]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel]], [[Julius Mosen]] (an epic, 1838), and [[Ludwig Köhler|Köhler]]; of [[novel]]s by [[Franz Horn]] (1818), [[Oeklers]], and [[Levin Schücking|Schücking]]; and of [[tragedy|tragedies]] by [[Ernst August Friedrich Klingemann|Klingemann]] ("{{lang|de|Ahasuerus}}", 1827) and [[Joseph Christian Freiherr von Zedlitz|Zedlitz]] (1844). It is either the Ahasuerus of Klingemann or that of [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] in his play, ''[[Halle und Jerusalem (play)|Halle and Jerusalem]]'' to whom [[Richard Wagner]] refers in the final passage of his notorious essay ''{{lang|de|[[Das Judentum in der Musik]]}}''.

There are clear echoes of the Wandering Jew in Wagner's ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', whose plot line is adapted from a story by [[Heinrich Heine]] in which the Dutchman is referred to as "the Wandering Jew of the ocean",&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Heine, ''{{lang|de|Aus den Memoiren des Herren von Schnabelewopski}}'', 1834. See Barry Millington, ''The Wagner Compendium'', London (1992), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and his final opera ''{{lang|de|[[Parsifal]]}}'' features a woman called Kundry who is in some ways a female version of the Wandering Jew. It is alleged that she was formerly [[Herodias]], and she admits that she laughed at Jesus on his route to the Crucifixion, and is now condemned to wander until she meets with him again (cf. Eugene Sue's version, below).

[[Robert Hamerling]], in his ''{{lang|de|Ahasver in Rom}}'' (Vienna, 1866), identifies [[Nero]] with the Wandering Jew. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] had designed a poem on the subject, the plot of which he sketched in his ''{{lang|de|[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Fifteenth Book of ''The autobiography of Goethe: truth and poetry, from my own life'' translated from the German by John Oxenford (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyofg02goet/autobiographyofg02goet_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The autobiography of Goethe : truth and poetry, from my own life"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

====Denmark====
[[Hans Christian Andersen]] made his "Ahasuerus" the Angel of Doubt, and was imitated by [[Seligmann Heller|Heller]] in a poem on "The Wandering of Ahasuerus", which he afterward developed into three cantos. [[Martin Andersen Nexø]] wrote a short story named "The Eternal Jew", in which he also refers to Ahasuerus as the spreading of the Jewish gene pool in Europe.

The story of the Wandering Jew is the basis of the essay, "The Unhappiest One" in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'' (published 1843 in [[Copenhagen]]). It is also discussed in an early portion of the book that focuses on [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

In the play "Genboerne" (The neighbors across the street), the Wandering Jew is a character (in this context called "Jerusalem's shoemaker") and his shoes will make you invisible when you wear them. The protagonist of the play borrows the shoes for a night and visits the house across the street as an invisible man.

====France====
{{Wikisourcelang|fr|Isaac Laquedem|Isaac Laquedem}}The French writer [[Edgar Quinet]] published his prose epic on the legend in 1833, making the subject the judgment of the world; and {{lang|fr|[[Eugène Sue]]}} wrote his ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Juif errant|Juif errant]]}}'' in 1844, in which the author connects the story of Ahasuerus with that of [[Herodias]]. Grenier's 1857 poem on the subject may have been inspired by {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Doré]]}}'s designs, which were published the preceding year. One should also note {{lang|fr|[[Paul Féval, père]]}}'s ''{{lang|fr|La Fille du Juif Errant}}'' (1864), which combines several fictional Wandering Jews, both heroic and evil, and [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' incomplete ''{{lang|fr|Isaac Laquedem}}'' (1853), a sprawling historical saga. In Guy de Maupassant's short story 'Uncle Judas' the local people believe that the old man in the story is the Wandering Jew.

====Russia====
In Russia, the legend of the Wandering Jew appears in an incomplete epic poem by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], "Ahasuerus" (1857) and in another epic poem by [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]], "Ahasuerus, a Poem in Fragments", written in 1832–1846 but not published until 1878, long after the poet's death. [[Alexander Pushkin]] also began a long poem on Ahasuerus (1826) but abandoned the project quickly, completing under thirty lines.

====Other literature====
The Wandering Jew makes a notable appearance in the [[gothic novel|gothic]] masterpiece of the [[Polish language|Polish]] writer [[Jan Potocki]], ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'', written about 1797.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

Brazilian writer and poet [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]] often used Jewish themes in his writings. One of his short stories, ''{{lang|pt|Viver!}}'' ("To Live!"), is a dialog between the Wandering Jew (named as Ahasverus) and [[Prometheus]] at the end of time. It was published in 1896 as part of the book ''{{lang|pt|Várias histórias}}'' (''Several stories'').

[[Castro Alves]], another Brazilian poet, wrote a poem named "{{lang|pt|Ahasverus e o gênio}}" ("Ahasverus and the genie"), in a reference to the Wandering Jew.

The [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] poet [[János Arany]] also wrote a ballad called "''{{lang|hu|Az örök zsidó}}''", meaning "The everlasting Jew".

The [[Slovenian people|Slovenian]] poet [[Anton Aškerc]] wrote a poem called "Ahasverjev tempelj" ("Ahasverus' Temple").

The Spanish military writer José Gómez de Arteche's novel ''Un soldado español de veinte siglos'' (''A Spanish soldier of twenty centuries'') (1874–1886) depicts the Wandering Jew as serving in the Spanish military of different periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realsociedadgeografica.com/es/pdf/militaresymarinos.pdf José María Gárate Córdoba, "José Gómez de Arteche y Moro (1821-1906)", in ''Militares y marinos en la Real Sociedad Geográfica'', 2006, pp. 79-102]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

====Latin America====
In Argentina, the topic of the Wandering Jew has appeared several times in the work of [[Enrique Anderson Imbert]], particularly in his short-story ''{{lang|es|El Grimorio}}'' (The Grimoire), included in the eponymous book.  Chapter XXXVII, ''{{lang|es|El Vagamundo}}'', in the collection of short stories, ''[[Misteriosa Buenos Aires]]'', by the Argentine writer [[Manuel Mujica Láinez]] also centres round the wandering of the Jew. The great Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] named the main character and narrator of his short story "The Immortal" Joseph Cartaphilus (in the story he was a Roman military tribune who gained immortality after drinking from a magical river and dies in the 1920s). In ''[[Green Mansions]]'', [[W.H. Hudson]]'s [[protagonist]] Abel, references [[Ahasuerus]], as an archetype of someone, like himself, who prays for redemption and peace; while condemned to walk the earth. In 1967, the Wandering Jew appears as an unexplained magical realist townfolk legend in [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[100 Years of Solitude]]''. A Colombian writer, Prospero Morales Pradilla, in his novel ''{{lang|es|Los pecados de Ines de Hinojosa}}'' (''The sins of Ines de Hinojosa'') describes the famous Wandering Jew of Tunja that has been there since the 16th century. He talks about the wooden statue of the Wandering Jew that is at Santo Domingo church and every year during the holy week is carried around in the shoulders of the Easter penitents around the city. The main feature of the statue are his eyes; they can express the hatred and anger in front of Jesus carrying the cross. In Mariano Azuela's novel of the Mexican Revolution, ''Los de abajo'', (''The Underdogs'') the character Venancio, a semi-educated barber, entertains the band of revolutionaries by recounting episodes from ''The Wandering Jew'', one of two books he had read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Underdogs|last=Azuela|first=Mariano|publisher=Penguin|year=2008 |origyear=1915|isbn=|location=New York|pages=15, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] parodies the character in "{{lang|fr|Le Passant de Prague}}" in his
collection ''{{lang|fr|L'Hérésiarque et Cie}}'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire,[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22356/22356-h/22356-h.htm#t1 "L'Hérésiarque &amp; Cie"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean d'Ormesson]]: ''{{lang|fr|Histoire du juif errant}}'' (1991)

[[Simone de Beauvoir]]: in her novel ''{{lang|fr|Tous les Hommes sont Mortels}}'' (1946, ''All Men are Mortal''), the leading figure Raymond Fosca undergoes a faith similar to the wandering Jew, who is being explicitly mentioned as a reference.

====German====
In both [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s ''The Green Face'' (1916) and [[Leo Perutz]]'s
''The Marquis of Bolibar'' (1920), the Wandering Jew features as a central character.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Rottensteiner]], "Afterword" in "The Green Face" by Meyrink, translated by Mike Mitchell. Sawtry : Dedalus/Ariadne, 1992, pp.218-224. {{ISBN|0-946626-92-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The German writer [[Stefan Heym]] in his novel ''{{lang|de|Ahasver}}'' (translated into English as ''The Wandering Jew'')&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University Press (1983) {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1706-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; maps a story of Ahasuerus and [[Lucifer]] raging between ancient times, the Germany of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and socialist [[East Germany]]. In Heym's depiction, the Wandering Jew is a highly sympathetic character.

====Dutch====
The Belgian writer [[August Vermeylen]] published in 1906 a novel called ''{{lang|nl|De wandelende Jood}}'' (''The Wandering Jew'').

====Romanian====
[[Mihai Eminescu]], an influential [[Romanian people|Romanian]] writer, depicts in his romantic fantastic novella ''{{lang|ro|Sarmanul Dionis}}'' a variation. A student follows a surreal journey through the book of [[Zoroaster]], a book seeming to give him God-like abilities. The book is given to him by Ruben, his Jewish master who is a [[philosopher]]. Dan is eventually tricked by Ruben and is sentenced by God to a life of insanity, which he can escape only by [[resurrection]].

Similarly, [[Mircea Eliade]] presents in his [[Bibliography of Mircea Eliade|novel]] ''Dayan'' (1979) a student's mystic and fantastic journey through time and space under the guidance of the Wandering Jew, in the search of a higher truth and of his own self.

====Russian====
The Soviet [[satire|satirists]] [[Ilya Ilf]] and [[Yevgeni Petrov (writer)|Yevgeni Petrov]] had their hero [[Ostap Bender]] tell the story of the Wandering Jew's death at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists in ''[[The Little Golden Calf]]''. In [[Vsevolod Ivanov]]'s story ''Ahasver'' a weird man comes to a Soviet writer in Moscow in 1944, introduces himself as "Ahasver the cosmopolite" and claims he is Paul von Eitzen, a theologian from Hamburg,  who concocted the legend of Wandering Jew in the 16th century to become rich and famous but then turned himself into a real Ahasver against his will. The novel ''Overburdened with Evil'' (1988) by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]] involves a character in modern setting who turns out to be Ahasuerus, identified at the same time in a subplot with [[John of Patmos|John the Divine]]. In the novel ''Going to the Light'' (''{{lang|ru|Идущий к свету}}'', 1998) by Sergey Golosovsky Ahasuerus turns out to be Apostle Paul punished (together with Moses and Mohammed) for inventing false religion.

====Swedish====
In [[Pär Lagerkvist]]'s 1956 novel ''The Sibyl'', Ahasuerus and a woman who was once the [[Delphic Sibyl]] each tell their stories, describing how an interaction with the divine damaged their lives. Lagerkvist continued the story of Ahasuerus in ''{{lang|sv|Ahasverus död}}'' ("The Death of Ahasuerus", 1960).

====English====
In [[O. Henry]]'s story "The Door of Unrest", a drunk shoemaker Mike O'Bader comes to a local newspaper editor and claims to be the Jerusalem shoemaker Michob Ader who did not let Christ rest upon his doorstep on the way to crucifixion and was condemned to live until the Second Coming. However, Mike O'Bader insists he is a [[Gentile]], not a Jew.

[[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols']] novella "Golgotha &amp; Co." in his collection ''Fantastica'' (1923) is a
satirical tale where the Wandering Jew is a successful businessman who subverts the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

In [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Helena'', the Wandering Jew appears in a dream to the protagonist and shows her where to look for the Cross, the goal of her quest.

An unidentified Jewish Wanderer appears in ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] novel by [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.]] first published in 1960; some children are heard saying of the old man, "What Jesus raises up STAYS raised up", implying that he is [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus of Bethany]], whom Christ raised from the dead. Another possibility hinted at in the novel is that this character is also Isaac Edward Leibowitz, founder of the Albertian Order of St. Leibowitz (and who was martyred for trying to preserve books from burning by a savage mob). The character speaks and writes in Hebrew and English, and wanders around the desert, though he has a tent on a [[mesa]] overlooking the abbey founded by Leibowitz, which is the setting for almost all the novel's action. The character appears again in three subsequent novellas which take place hundreds of years apart, and in Miller's 1997 follow-up novel, ''[[Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman]]''.

Ahasuerus must remain on Earth after space travel is developed in [[Lester del Rey]]'s "Earthbound" (1963).&lt;ref name="delrey196308"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=del Rey |first=Lester |date=August 1963 |title=Earthbound |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v21n06_1963-08#page/n22/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. G. Ballard]]'s short story "The Lost Leonardo", published in ''[[The Terminal Beach]]'' (1964), centres on a search for the Wandering Jew. The Wandering Jew also appears in [[Mary Elizabeth Counselman]]'s story "A Handful of Silver" (1967).&lt;ref&gt;"A Handful of Silver" in ''Half In Shadow'' by Mary Elizabeth Counselman, William Kimber, 1980 (p205-212).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Sadler]] has written a series of books featuring a character called [[Casca (series)|Casca Rufio Longinus]] who is a combination of two characters from Christian folklore, [[Saint Longinus]] and the Wandering Jew. [[Jack L. Chalker]] wrote a five book series called ''The [[Well World]] Saga'' in which it is mentioned many times that the creator of the universe, a man named Nathan Brazil, is known as the Wandering Jew. There is a discussion about the Wandering Jew in the [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]] novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]''. The horror novel ''Devil Daddy'' (1972) by [[John Blackburn (author)|John Blackburn]] features the Wandering Jew. &lt;ref&gt;Alan Warren, "The Curse", in S. T. Joshi, ed., ''Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: an Encyclopedia of our Worst Nightmares'' (Greenwood, 2007), (op. 129-160) {{ISBN|0-31333-781-0}} &lt;/ref&gt; In January 1987 [[DC Comics]] the 10th issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' gave [[Phantom Stranger|The Phantom Stranger]] four possible origins.

[[George Sylvester Viereck]] and [[Paul Eldridge]] wrote a trilogy of novels ''My First Two Thousand Years: an Autobiography of the Wandering Jew'' (1928), in which Isaac Laquedem is a Roman soldier who, after being told by Jesus that he will "tarry until I return", goes on to influence many of the great events of history. He frequently encounters Solome (described as "The Wandering Jewess"), and travels with a companion, to whom he has passed on his immortality via a blood transfusion (another attempt to do this for a woman he loved ended in her death).

In ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]] (2003), a woman who is addressed as the Wandering Jew plays a central role, though her real name is Savi.

The Wandering Jew is revealed to be [[Judas Iscariot]] in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s distant-future science fiction parable of [[Christianity]], the 1979 short story "[[The Way of Cross and Dragon]]".&lt;!--Please read and contribute to the talk page discussion before adding references to: The Phantom Stranger, Keel Lorenz, Lazarus Long, Nathan Brazil, Hob Gadling (Sandman) or any other character that isn't explicitly named by the author as the Wandering Jew.

The Wandering Jew appears as a sympathetic character in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Homeward Bounders]]''. His fate is tied in with larger plot themes regarding destiny, disobedience, and punishment.  "Ahasver", a cult leader identified with the Wandering Jew, is a central figure in [[Anthony Boucher]]'s classic mystery novel ''Nine Times Nine'' (originally published 1940 under the name H. Holmes). The Wandering Jew encounters a returned Christ in [[Deborah Grabien]]'s 1990 novel ''Plainsong''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gilmore, "Grabien, Deborah" in ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', edited by David Pringle. St. James Press, 1996. {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}} (pp.238-39)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Wandering Jew" is the title of a short poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson which appears in his book ''The Three Taverns''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/threetavernsbook00robiuoft|title=The three taverns; a book of poems|first=Edwin Arlington|last=Robinson|date=1 January 1920|publisher=New York Macmillan Co|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, the speaker encounters a mysterious figure with eyes that "remembered everything". He recognizes him from "his image when I was a child" and finds him to be bitter, with "a ringing wealth of old anathemas"; a man for whom the "world around him was a gift of anguish". The speaker does not know what became of him, but believes that "somewhere among men to-day / Those old, unyielding eyes may flash / And flinch&amp;nbsp;– and look the other way."

Although he does not appear in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' [1973], the central character, [[Lazarus Long]], claims to have encountered the Wandering Jew at least once, possibly multiple times, over the course of his long life. According to Lazarus, he was then using the name Sandy Macdougal and was operating as a [[confidence man]]. He is described as having red hair and being, in Lazarus' words, a "crashing bore".

===21st century===
====Brazil====
Brazilian writer Glauco Ortolano in his 2000 novel ''Domingos Vera Cruz: Memorias de um Antropofago Lisboense no Brasil'' uses the theme of the Wandering Jew for its main character, Domingos Vera Cruz, who flees to Brazil in one of the first Portuguese expeditions to the New World after murdering his wife's lover in Portugal. In order to avoid eternal damnation, he must fully repent of his crime. The book of memoirs Domingos dictates in the 21st Century to an anonymous transcriber narrates his own saga throughout 500 years of Brazilian history. At the end, Domingos indicates he is finally giving in as he senses the arrival of the Son of Man. 
  
====United Kingdom====
English writer Stephen Gallagher uses the Wandering Jew as a theme in his 2007 novel ''The Kingdom of Bones.'' The Wandering Jew is a character, a theater manager and actor, who turned away from God and toward depravity in exchange for long life and prosperity. He must find another person to take on the persona of the wanderer before his life ends or risk eternal damnation. He eventually does find a substitute in his protégé, Louise. The novel revolves around another character's quest to find her and save her from her assumed damnation.

Sarah Perry's 2018 novel ''Melmoth'' is part-inspired by the Wandering Jew, and makes several references to the legend in discussing the origin of its titular character.

====United States====
American writer Jaxon Reed portrays the Wandering Jew as an assassin for the Westphalian Courts in his 2018 novel ''Cybershot: An Empathic Detective Novel.'' The character stays abreast of technology and uses it against the military and others.

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbek writer Isajon Sulton published his novel ''The Wandering Jew'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.ut.uz/eng/kaleidoscope/triumph_of_the_uszbek_author.mgr |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903062822/http://old.ut.uz/eng/kaleidoscope/triumph_of_the_uszbek_author.mgr |archive-date=3 September 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, the Jew does not characterize a symbol of curse; however, they appear as a human being, who is aware of God’s presence, after being cursed by Him. Moreover, the novel captures the fortune of present-day wandering Jews, created by humans using high technologies.

In his painting ''The Wandering Jew'' (1983) [[Michael Sgan-Cohen]] depicts a birdlike figure standing with a black hand pointed to the back of its head, as if it were holding a gun; another hand points down from heaven is using the motif of the Hand of God and suggesting the divine origin of the curse. The birdlike figure depicted is wearing a ''[[Judenhut]]''. The empty chair in the foreground of the painting is a symbol of how the figure cannot settle down and is forced to keep wandering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishlearningworks.org/news/2016/4/19/educators-resources-for-passover|publisher=Jewish Learning Works |title=Educator's Resources for Passover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ideology (19th century and after)==
By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the figure of the "Wandering Jew" as a legendary individual had begun to be identified with the fate of the Jewish people as a whole. After the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte at the end of the century and the emancipating reforms in European countries connected with the policy of [[Napoleon and the Jews]], the "Eternal Jew" became an increasingly "symbolic ... and universal character" as the continuing struggle for Jewish emancipation in Prussia and elsewhere in Europe in the course of the nineteenth century gave rise to what came to be referred to as "the Jewish Question".&lt;ref name="Bein1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bein|first=Alex |title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 April 1990|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3252-9|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Kaulbach's mural replica of his painting ''Titus destroying Jerusalem'' had been commissioned by the King of Prussia in 1842 for the projected Neues Museum, Berlin, [[Gabriel Riesser]]'s essay "Stellung der Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens in Deutschland" ("On the Position of Confessors of the Mosaic Faith in Germany") had been published in 1831 and the journal ''Der Jude, periodische Blätter für Religions- und Gewissensfreiheit'' (''The Jew, Periodical for Freedom of Religion and Thought'') had been founded in 1832. In 1840 Kaulbach himself had published a booklet of Explanations identifying the main figures for his projected painting, including that of the Eternal Jew in flight as an outcast for having rejected Christ. In 1843 [[Bruno Bauer]]'s book ''[[The Jewish Question]]'' was published,&lt;ref&gt;"Die Judenfrage", Brunswick, 1843 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2668-bauer-bruno], where Bauer argued that religious allegiance must be renounced by both Jews and Christians as a precondition of juridical equality and political and social freedom. (Moggach, Douglas, "Bruno Bauer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition)[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/bauer/]&lt;/ref&gt; to which [[Karl Marx]] responded by an article with the title "[[On the Jewish Question]]".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Jewish Question'', Karl Marx, written 1843, first published in Paris in 1844 under the German title "Zur Judenfrage" in the Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A caricature which had first appeared in a French publication in 1852, depicting the legendary figure with "a red cross on his forehead, spindly legs and arms, huge nose and blowing hair, and staff in hand", was co-opted by anti-Semites.&lt;ref name="Mosse1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosse|first=George L. |title=The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXd_2_ebSekC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=8 October 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512660-0|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown at the Nazi exhibition ''Der Ewige Jude'' in Germany and Austria in 1937–1938. A reproduction of it was exhibited at [[Yad Vashem]] in 2007 (shown here).

The exhibition had been held at the Library of the [[German Museum]] in Munich from November 8, 1937 to January 31, 1938 showing works that the Nazis considered to be "[[degenerate art]]". A book containing images of these works was published under the title ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name=HolocaustResearchProject&gt;{{cite web |title=Der ewige Jude: "The Eternal Jew or The Wandering Jew"|url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/derewigejude.html|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been preceded by other such exhibitions in Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Dresden, Berlin and Vienna. The works of art displayed at these exhibitions were generally executed by avant-garde artists who had become recognized and esteemed in the 1920s, but the objective of the exhibitions was not to present the works as worthy of admiration but to deride and condemn them.&lt;ref name="West2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Shearer |title=The visual arts in Germany 1890-1937: Utopia and despair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCSsgp4V7eYC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5279-8|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in popular media==

===Stage===
[[Fromental Halévy]]'s opera ''[[Le Juif errant (opera)|Le Juif errant]]'', based on the novel by [[Eugène Sue|Sue]], was premiered at the [[Paris Opera]] ([[Salle Le Peletier]]) on 23 April 1852, and had 48 further performances over two seasons. The music was sufficiently popular to generate a ''Wandering Jew [[Mazurka]]'', a ''Wandering Jew [[Waltz]]'', and a ''Wandering Jew [[Polka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, (1991), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hebrew-language play titled ''The Eternal Jew'' premiered at the Moscow [[Habimah Theatre]] in 1919 and was performed at the Habima Theatre in New York in 1926.&lt;ref name="Nahshon2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahshon|first=Edna |title=Jews and shoes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx--Mja-DJUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=15 September 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-050-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Wolfit]] made his debut as the Wandering Jew in a stage adaptation in London in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Harwood|Harwood, Ronald]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36992 "Wolfit , Sir Donald (1902–1968)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 14 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The play ''Spikenard'' (1930) by [[C. E. Lawrence]], has the Jew wander an uninhabited Earth along with [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and the [[Impenitent thief]].&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; [[Glen Berger]]'s 2001 play ''[[Underneath the Lintel]]'' is a monologue by a Dutch librarian who delves into the history of a book that is returned 113 years overdue and becomes convinced that the borrower was the Wandering Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alley Theatre |url=http://www.AlleyTheatre.org/Alley/Underneath_the_Lintel_EN.asp?SnID=504862558 |title=Underneath the Lintel |publisher=Alley Theatre |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
There have been several films on the topic of ''The Wandering Jew'':
* 1904 silent film called ''Le Juif Errant'' by [[Georges Méliès]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| publisher = Star Film Company| people = Georges Méliès(Director)| title = Le Juif Errant| accessdate = 2018-05-13| date = 1904| url = https://archive.org/details/LeJuifErrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1923 saw ''[[The Wandering Jew (1923 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', a British [[silent film]] by [[Maurice Elvey]] from the basis of [[E. Temple Thurston]]'s play, starring [[Matheson Lang]]. The play had been produced both in Twickenham, [[London]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1921, the latter co-produced by [[David Belasco]]. The play, as well as the two films based upon it, attempts to tell the legend literally, taking the Jew from [[Biblical]] times all the way to the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. 
* Elvey also directed the 1933 remake ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', with [[Conrad Veidt]] in the title role; the film was so popular it broke box office records at the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Daily|date=24 January 1935|publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, inc.|page=242|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily67wids#page/n241/mode/2up/search/%2238+years%22|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1933, the Jewish Talking Picture Company released a [[Yiddish]]-language film entitled ''[[The Eternal Jew (1933 film)|The Eternal Jew]]''. 
* In 1940, there was a propaganda "documentary" film made in Germany entitled ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der Ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew''), reflecting [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] [[anti-Semitism]], linking the legend with alleged Jewish malpractices over the ages. 
* Still another film version of the story, made in Italy in 1948, starred [[Vittorio Gassman]].
* In the 1988 film ''[[The Seventh Sign]]'' the Wandering Jew appears as Father Lucci, who identifies himself as the centuries old Cartaphilus, [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate's]] porter, who took part in the scourging of [[Jesus]] before his crucifixion.
* The 2000 [[horror film]] ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' and its sequels equate the Wandering Jew with [[Judas Iscariot]].

===Television===
* In the third episode of the first season of [[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|''The Librarians'']], the character Jenkins mentions the Wandering Jew as an "immortal creature that can be injured, but never killed".
* In the [[Fargo (Season 3)|third season]] of the FX series [[Fargo (TV series)|''Fargo'']], a character named Paul Marrane appears to three major characters. He acts as a source of counsel to two of them (one of whom he provides a chance at redemption), while forcing the third to confront his past involvement in numerous killings.
* In the Japanese manga and accompanying anime series ''[[The Ancient Magus' Bride]]'', the Wandering Jew is represented in the antagonist of Cartaphilus. In his search to end his eternal suffering, Cartaphilus serves as a nuisance to the progression of Chise's training.
* In the TV series ''Peaky Blinders'' (BBC2) Jewish gangster, Alfie solomons, played by Tom Hardy, described himself as "The Wandering Jew".

===Comics===
The [[DC Comics]] character [[Phantom Stranger]], a mysterious hero with paranormal abilities, was given four possible origins in an issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' with one of them identifying him as the Wandering Jew. He now dedicates his time to helping mankind, even declining a later offer from God to release him from his penance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Mike W. Barr|Barr, Mike W.]]|penciller= Aparo, Jim|inker= Aparo, Jim|story= Tarry Till I Come Again|title= Secret Origins|volume= 2|issue= 10|date= January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Deitch's ''[[A Shroud for Waldo]]'' serialized in weekly papers such as ''[[New York Press]]'' and released in book form by [[Fantagraphics]], the hospital attendant who revives Waldo as a hulking demon so he can destroy the AntiChrist, is none other than the Wandering Jew. For carrying out this mission, he is awarded a normal life and, it is implied, marries the woman he just rescued. Waldo, having reverted to cartoon cat form, is also rewarded, finding it in a freight car.

In Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman]]'' comic series, the character Hob Gadling represents the archetypal Wandering Jew. Later, the character Johanna Constantine remarks on a rumor that The Devil and the Wandering Jew meet once every hundred years in a tavern, further drawing out the connection.

In Kore Yamazaki's manga ''[[The Ancient Magus' Bride]]'', the character Cartaphilus, also known as Joseph, is a mysterious being that looks like a young boy, but is much older. He is dubbed "The Wandering Jew" and is said to have been cursed with immortality for throwing a rock at the Son of God. It is later revealed that Joseph and Cartaphilus used to be two different people until Joseph fused with Cartaphilus in an attempt to remove his curse, only to become cursed himself.

In various [[Pokémon]] media, including the ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'' manga and the [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] games, a character named AZ is cursed with eternal life and wanders in search of his lost Pokémon for the part he played in a war, thus sharing similar qualities with the Wandering Jew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ AZ in ''Bulbapedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
