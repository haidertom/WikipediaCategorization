'''Afrocentrism''' (also '''Afrocentricity''') is an approach to the study of world history that focuses on the history of people of recent{{what|date=November 2018}} [[Africa]]n descent. It is in some respects a response to global ([[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]]) attitudes about [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their historical contributions; it seeks to correct mistakes and ideas perpetuated by the racist philosophical underpinnings of western academic disciplines as they developed during and since Europe's Early Renaissance as justifying rationales for the enslavement of other peoples, in order to enable more accurate accounts of not only African but all people's contributions to world history.&lt;ref&gt;CC Verharen, “Molefi Asante...”, The Western Journal of Black Studies, (24)4, 2000, pp. 223-238&lt;/ref&gt;  Afrocentricity deals primarily with [[self-determination]] and African agency and is a [[Pan-African]] point of view for the study of culture, [[philosophy]], and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asante.net/articles/1/afrocentricity/ Asante on Afrocentricity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Africana"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (eds), ''[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American]]'' Volume 1, p. 111, Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrism is a scholarly movement that seeks to conduct research and education on global history subjects, from the perspective of historical African peoples and polities. It takes a critical stance on Euro-centric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exagerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture and Greek philosophy among others.

What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.&lt;ref&gt;General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct historiography, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm Wilson J. Moses: Historical Sketches of Afrocentrism].&lt;/ref&gt; Today{{when|date=December 2017}} it is primarily associated with [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Ivan van Sertima]] and [[Molefi Asante]].&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Asante, ''The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism: An Afrocentric Response to Critics'', foreword by [[Maulana Karenga]]: "Molefi Asante, the founding and preeminent theorist of Afrocentricity, is one of the most important intellectuals at work today. This work continues his tradition of combining an extraordinary intellectual range with an impressive ability to identify and clarify central issues in the current discourse on Afrocentricity, multiculturalism, race, culture, ethnicity and related themes. Dr. Asante offers an insightful and valuable response to Eurocentric critics of the Afrocentric initiative while simultaneously addressing a wide range of issues critical to understanding this important intellectual enterprise, including African agency, location, orientation, centerdness, subject-place and cultural groundedness. The volume is thoughtful, multifaceted and rewarding, and yields a rich sense of the contours and complexity of the Afrocentric project." --Dr. Maulana Karenga, Chair, Department of Black Studies, California State University, Long Beach."&lt;/ref&gt; Cheick Anta Diop is the primary source of African-centred academic literature, the methodology of his research on the Nubian origins of Egyptian civilization earned him authorship of a chapter in [[UNESCO]]'s General History of Africa manual, called "Origin of the Ancient Egyptians" &lt;ref&gt;General History of Africa, Vol 2, p27, UNESCO, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Afrocentrism support the claim that the contributions of various Black African people have been downplayed or discredited as part of the legacy of [[colonialism]] and slavery's [[pathology]] of "writing Africans out of history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3819303 Rewriting History, Rebel and Motherhood by Susan Andrade].p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodson|first=Carter Godwin|authorlink=Carter G.

==Terminology==
The term "Afrocentrism" dates to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moses|first=Wilson Jeremiah|authorlink=|title=Afrotopia: The Roots of African American Popular History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hx0LGNxO_mAC&amp;pg=PA44|date=13 September 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47941-7|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "Afrocentric" appears in a typescript proposal for an entry in ''[[Encyclopedia Africana]]'', possibly due to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elegant Inconsistencies: Race, Nation, and Writing in Wilson Jeremiah Moses's Afrotopia|last=Levine|first=Robert|doi=10.1093/alh/ajn016|url=http://alh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ajn016|year=2008|journal=American Literary History|volume=20|page=497|issue=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214084822/http://alh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ajn016|archivedate=14 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abstract noun "Afrocentricity" dates to the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thairu, Kihumbu|title=The African Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOk_AAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=[[East African Literature Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} and was popularized by [[Molefi Asante]]'s ''Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change'' (1980). Afrocentrists led by Molefe Asante have organised their critics into three categories, Capitulationists, Europeanised Loyalists, and Maskers. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Capitulationists condemn Afrocentricity because they are uncomfortable with themselves and do not believe that Africans should be considered agents. They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, Stanley Crouch, and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities. Their tragedy is that they seek to please the master so they attack Afrocentrists to prove to whites that they are like them. They fear that they may lose their careers"&lt;ref&gt;MK Asante, Afrocentricity: The theory of social change..., p. 7; MK Asante&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Afrocentricity and its critics…” (available at http://science.jrank.org/pages/8216/Afrocentricity-Afrocentricity-Its-Critics.html, as accessed on 2 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of [[Africa]]n and [[African diaspora]] intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of [[slavery]] and the decline of [[colonialism]]. Following the [[American Civil War]], African Americans in the [[Southern United States|South]] gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, W. E. B., ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''.

{{Quote|The combination of the European centuries gives us about four to five hundred years of solid European domination of intellectual concepts and philosophical ideas. Africa and Asia were subsumed under various headings of the European hierarchy. If a war between the European powers occurred it was called a World War and the Asians and Africans found their way on the side of one European power or the other.There was this sense of assertiveness about European culture that advanced with Europe's trade, religious, and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asante.net/articles/51/de-westernizing-communication-strategies-for-neutralizing-cultural-myths/ De-Westernizing Communication: Strategies for Neutralizing Cultural Myths].&lt;/ref&gt;|Molefi Asante|"De-Westernizing Communication: Strategies for Neutralizing Cultural Myths"}}

As an ideology and political movement, Afrocentrism had its beginnings in activism among black intellectuals, political figures, and historians in the context of the US American [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olaniyan, T.

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} According to U.S. professor Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, concepts of Afrocentricity lie at the core of disciplines such as [[African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, "The Place of Africalogy in the University Curriculum", ''Journal of Black Studies'', vol. 26 no. 6, July 1999, pp. 688–712.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Wilson J. Moses]] claims that Afrocentrism roots are not exclusively African:
{{Quote|Despite the fulminations of ethno-chauvinists and other prejudiced persons, it remains a fact that the contributions of white scholars, like Boas, Malinowski, and Herskovits, were fundamental to that complex of ideas that we designate to days as Afrocentrism...Students of African and African American history have long appreciated the irony that much of what we now call Afrocentrism was developed during the 1930s by the Jewish American scholar [[Melville Herskovits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm |title=Two Scholars Discuss Afrocentrism |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Wilson J.

In 1987, [[Martin Bernal]] published his ''[[Black Athena]]'', in which he claims that ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture.

==Aspects==

===Afrocentricity book===
{{main|Afrocentricity (book)}}
In 2000, [[Molefi Kete Asante]], chair of the Department of African American Studies at [[Temple University]] gave a lecture at the [[University of Liverpool]] entitled "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,"&lt;ref&gt;Kete Asante, Molefi, [http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium"], University of Liverpool, 2 August 2000, accessed 11 February 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302025412/http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html |date=2 March 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented many of his ideas:
* Africa has been betrayed by international commerce, by [[missionaries]] and [[imams]], by the structure of knowledge imposed by the Western world, by its own leaders, and by the ignorance of its own people of its past.
* [[Philosophy]] originated in Africa and the first philosophers in the world were Africans.
* Afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data, and a novel orientation to data; it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the African world.
* His aim is "to help lay out a plan for the recovery of African place, respectability, accountability, and leadership."
* Afrocentricity can stand its ground among any ideology or religion: Marxism, [[Islam]], Christianity, Buddhism, or [[Judaism]]. Your Afrocentricity will emerge in the presence of these other ideologies because it is from you.
* Afrocentrism is the only ideology that can liberate African people.

Asante also stated:
{{quote|As a cultural configuration, the Afrocentric idea is distinguished by five characteristics:
# an intense interest in psychological location as determined by symbols, motifs, rituals, and signs.
# a commitment to finding the subject-place of Africans in any social, political, economic, or religious phenomenon with implications for questions of sex, gender, and class.
# a defence of African cultural elements as historically valid in the context of art, music, and literature.
# a celebration of centeredness and agency and a commitment to lexical refinement that eliminates pejoratives about Africans or other people.
# a powerful imperative from historical sources to revise the collective text of African people.}}
However, Wilson J. Moses, said of Asante: "His second book, ''The Afrocentric Idea'' (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in "[[critical theory]]" that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s."&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"/&gt; Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Afrocentric education===
{{Main|Afrocentric education}}
Afrocentric education is education designed to empower peoples of the African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Dr. Carter G. (1933). ''The Mis-Education of the Negro''. Khalifah's Booksellers &amp; Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar, Dr. Na'im (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Paulo Freire|educational leaders of other cultures]], proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.

===Afrocentric theology===
{{Further|Black theology|Black church}}
The [[black church]] in the United States developed out of the [[creolization]] of African spirituality and European-American [[Christianity]]; early members of the churches made certain stories their own{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. During the [[American Civil War|antebellum]] years, the idea of deliverance out of [[slavery]], as in the story of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], was especially important{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with [[Jesus]], and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Twentieth-century "Africentric approaches" to Christian [[theology]] and preaching have been more deliberate.

===Race and Pan-African identity===
{{anchor|race}}
{{further|Ancient Egyptian race controversy|Pan-Africanism}}
Many Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} seek to challenge concepts such as [[white privilege]], [[Color blindness (race)|color-blind]] perspectives, and race-neutral pedagogies. There are strong ties between Afrocentricity and [[Critical race theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo, Zeus (2005). ''Critical Pedagogy and Race'', p. 129 {{ISBN|1-4051-2968-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrists agree with the current scientific consensus that holds that Africans exhibit a range of types and physical characteristics, and that such elements as wavy hair or aquiline facial features are part of a continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. They cite work by Hiernaux&lt;ref name=Hiernaux&gt;{{cite book

Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of discredited theories, such as the [[Hamitic#Hamitic hypothesis|Hamitic hypothesis]] and the [[Dynastic Race Theory]]. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as "Caucasoid" groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as "Black" Africans to those south of the [[Sahara]], but used broader "Caucasoid" or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the first North African populations were closely related to "Caucasoids" of Europe and western Asia.&lt;ref name="Hiernaux"/&gt;

In 1964 Afrocentric scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] expressed a belief in such a double standard:
{{quote|But it is only the most gratuitous theory that considers the Dinka, the Nouer and the Masai, among others, to be Caucasoids. What if an African ethnologist were to persist in recognising as white only the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, and systematically refused membership to the remaining Europeans, and Mediterraneans in particular—the French, Italians, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese? Just as the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean countries must be considered as two extreme poles of the same anthropological reality, so should the Negroes of East and West Africa be considered as the two extremes in the reality of the Negro world. To say that a Shillouk, a Dinka, or a Nouer is a Caucasoid is for an African as devoid of sense and scientific interest as would be, to a European, an attitude that maintained that a Greek or a Latin were not of the same race.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}}}

French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that [[archaeological]] workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Vercoutter, ''The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering Meroitic Script''. Paris: UNESCO, 1978, pp. 15–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} have adopted a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] perspective that people of color are all "African people" or "[[diaspora|diasporic]] Africans," citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar [[Runoko Rashidi]] writes that they are all part of the "global African community." Some Afrocentric writers include in the [[African diaspora]] the [[Dravidians]] of India, "[[Negrito]]s" of Southeast Asia ([[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Malaysia]]); and the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples of Australia and Melanesia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A few Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} claim that the [[Olmecs]] of [[Mexico]] were a hybrid society of Native American peoples and Africans. Mainstream historians of Mesoamerica overwhelmingly reject that view with detailed rebuttals.&lt;ref name=Ortiz1997&gt;{{cite journal

===Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas theories===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}
In the 1970s, [[Ivan van Sertima]] advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in ''They Came Before Columbus'', published in 1978. The few [[Trans-cultural diffusion|hyper-diffusionist]] writers seek to establish that the [[Olmec]] people, who built the first highly complex civilization in [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of "doctoring" and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars in the advance of his own theory.&lt;ref name="Ortiz1997"/&gt;

===Afrocentrism and Ancient Egypt===

Several Afrocentrists have claimed that important cultural characteristics of ancient [[Egypt]] were indigenous to Africa and that these features were present in other early African civilizations&lt;ref name=Diop1964&gt;{{cite journal

The claim has also been made by many Afrocentric scholars that the Ancient Egyptians themselves were [[Black African]] (sub-saharan African) rather than North African/Maghrebi, and that the various invasions on Egypt resulted in the Africanity of Ancient Egypt becoming diluted, resulting in the modern diversity seen today.&lt;ref name="Ivan van Sertima 1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Van Sertima, Ivan|title=Egypt, Child of Africa|authorlink=Ivan van Sertima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7KmBTz2vUoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2-IA1,M1|year=1994|isbn=1-56000-792-3 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a [[UNESCO]] Symposium in the 1970s, the vast majority of the delegates repudiated the Afrocentric assertions.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings", (Paris, 1978), pp. 3–134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zahi Hawass]] has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and Ancient Egypt was not a Black African Civilization.&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |title=Egyptology News" Blog Archive " Hawass says that Tutankhamun was not black |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2009-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727185516/http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |archive-date=27 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contestations, [[UNESCO]] decided to include his "Origin of the ancient Egyptians" in the General History of Africa, with an editorial comment mentioning the disagreement. 
It should also be noted that the ancient world did not employ racial categories such as "Black" or "White" as they had no conception of "race", but rather labeled groups according to their land of origin and cultural traits. However, [[S. O. Y. Keita]], a biological anthropologist studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as "black" or "white" to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthropology News'', December 2007, Vol. 48, No. 9, pp. 19-20, {{doi|10.1525/an.2007.48.9.19}}; see also "Forensic Misclassification of Ancient Nubian Crania: Implications for Assumptions About Human Variation", Frank L'Engle Williams, Robert L.

===Hamitic hypothesis===
Stephen Howe summarizes the development of the Hamitic hypothesis in the 19th and 20th centuries as Eurocentric. He further describes how some Afrocentric writers adopted 'their version' of it. Howe distinguishes three clusters of controversies related to the history of [[Ancient Egypt]]. About the third cluster he says that these are "controversies that have been especially salient in relation to the United States, have interacted heavily with sensitive issues of current public policy, and involve questions both wide and fundamentally about the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howe, Stephen|title=Afrocentrism: mythical pasts and imagined homes|publisher=Verso|location=London|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

{{quote|Thus, if historical myths and legends, or an invented history, play such a major role in the founding of every national reconstruction, the question that should concern us here is the nature of the distinct style in which black Americans imagine their past. The answer to this question is that radical Afrocentrism, the subject of this study, which plays a central role in shaping the modern historical world-view of a large section of the African-American (or Afro-American) community, is far more than an effort to follow the line taken by many [[ethnic]] groups and nations in modern rewriting, inventing or developing collective identity and national history. Rather, it is a large-scale historical project to rewrite the history of the whole of humankind from an Afrocentric point of view. The result is a new reconstruction of world history: it is a universal history.}}

[[Mary Lefkowitz]], Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, has rejected [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that [[Aristotle]] could not have stolen his ideas from the great [[Library at Alexandria]] as James suggested, because the library was founded ''after'' Aristotle's death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as "an excuse to teach myth as history."&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1996"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1994 the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published ''Alternatives to Afrocentrism'', a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, [[Gerald Early]], Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco. Early, an African American, has been especially critical and dismisses Afrocentrism as just another North American experiment in "group therapy," a kind of "intellectual fast food".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2002 Ibrahim Sundiata noted in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' that 
{{quote|The word "Afrocentric" has been traced by Derrick Alridge to the American historian W.E.B. Du Bois, who employed it in the early 1960s. During the 1970s, Molefi Kete Asante appropriated the term, insisting that he was the only person equipped to define it, and asserting that even the holy archangels Du Bois and [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] had an imperfect and immature grasp of a concept that finds ultimate expression in his own pontifications. Subsequently, it became a catchall "floating signifier," nebulous, unstable, and infinitely mutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://way.net/dissonance/sundiata.html Ibrahim Sundiata, "The Argument We Are Really Having"], ''American Historical Review'', (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cain Hope Felder]], a Professor of [[New Testament]] Language and Literature at [[Howard University]] and supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls,&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope Felder | first1 = Cain | year = 1994 | title = Afrocentrism, the Bible, and the Politics of Difference | url = http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm | journal = The Princeton Seminary Bulletin | volume = XV | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Demonizing categorically all white people, without careful differentiation between persons of goodwill and those who consciously perpetuate racism.
* Adopting [[multiculturalism]] as a curricular alternative that eliminates, marginalizes, or vilifies European heritage to the point that Europe epitomizes all the evil in the world.
* Gross over-generalizations and using factually or incorrect material is bad history and bad scholarship.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt;

[[Nathan Glazer]] writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"&gt;Nathan Glazer, ''We Are All Multiculturalists Now'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-674-94836-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz's book ''Not Out of Africa''. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"/&gt; The late [[Manning Marable]] was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"/&gt;
{{Quote|Populist Afrocentrism was the perfect social theory for the upwardly mobile black petty bourgeoisie. It gave them a sense of ethnic superiority and cultural originality, without requiring the hard, critical study of historical realities. It provided a philosophical blueprint to avoid concrete struggle within the real world.... It was, in short, only the latest theoretical construct of a politics of racial identity, a world-view designed to discuss the world but never really to change it.|Manning Marable| Beyond Black and White: Transforming African American Politics}}

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan notes that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of "a few non-Afrocentrists" as "an indictment against Afrocentricity."&lt;ref name="DefendingtheParadigm"&gt;Adisa A. Alkebulan, "Defending the Paradigm", ''Journal of Black Studies'', Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 410–427 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the historian [[August Meier]] critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as "Eurocentric". He criticized her book ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History'' for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she "fails to answer the question raised in this book's subtitle".&lt;ref&gt;Meier, August, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2945660 "Review: Mary Lefkowitz, ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History''"], ''Journal of American History'', December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maghan Keita]] describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a [[cultural war]]. He believes certain "epistemologies" are warring with each other: the "epistemology of blackness" argues for the "responsibilities and potential of black peoples to function in and contribute to the progress of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Maghan Keita, ''Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], ''The Golden Age''|300px|right]]
The '''Ages of Man''' are the stages of human existence on the Earth according to [[Greek mythology]] and its subsequent [[Roman mythology|Roman]] interpretation.

Both [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] offered accounts of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, in which humans are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation of the [[human condition]] over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value.

==Hesiod's Five Ages==
[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - The Close of the Silver Age (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|Lucas Cranach the Elder, ''The Silver Age''|thumb|250px|right]]
[[File:Virgil Solis - Iron Age.jpg|[[Virgil Solis]], ''The Iron Age''|thumb|250px|right]]

The first extant account of the successive ages of humanity comes from the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC), in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'' (lines 109–201). His list is:
* '''Golden Age''' – The [[Golden Age]] is the only age that falls within the rule of [[Cronus]]. Created by the immortals who live on Olympus, these humans were said to live among the gods, and freely mingled with them. Peace and harmony prevailed during this age. Humans did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully. Their spirits live on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in [[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] (397e) recounts the golden race of men who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men literally made of gold, but good and noble. He describes these men as [[Daemon (mythology)|daemons]] upon the earth. Since δαίμονες (''daimones'') is derived from δαήμονες (''daēmones'', meaning knowing or wise), they are beneficent, preventing ills, and guardians of mortals.
* '''Silver Age''' – The [[Silver Age]] and every age that follows fall within the rule of Cronus's successor and son, [[Zeus]]. Men in the Silver age lived for one hundred years under the dominion of their mothers. They lived only a short time as grown adults, and spent that time in strife with one another. During this Age men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed them for their [[impiety]]. After death, humans of this age became "blessed spirits" of the underworld.
* '''Bronze Age''' – Men of the Bronze Age were hardened and tough, as war was their purpose and passion. Zeus created these humans out of the ash tree. Their armor was forged of [[bronze]], as were their homes, and tools. The men of this Age were undone by their own violent ways and left no named spirits; instead, they dwell in the "dank house of [[Hades]]". This Age came to an end with the flood of [[Deucalion]].
* '''Heroic Age''' – The [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]] is the one age that does not correspond with any metal. It is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows. It was the heroes of this Age who fought at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Troy]]. This race of humans died and went to [[Elysium]].
* '''Iron Age''' – Hesiod finds himself in the Iron Age. During this age humans live an existence of toil and misery. Children dishonor their parents, brother fights with brother and the social contract between guest and host ([[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]) is forgotten. During this age [[might makes right]], and bad men use lies to be thought good. At the height of this age, humans no longer feel shame or indignation at wrongdoing; babies will be born with gray hair and the gods will have completely forsaken humanity: "there will be no help against evil."

==Ovid's Four Ages==
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Ovid]] (1st century BC&amp;nbsp;– 1st century AD) tells a similar myth of Four Ages in Book 1.89–150 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. His account is similar to Hesiod's, with the exception that he omits the Heroic Age. Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the '''Golden Age'''. He adds that in this age, men did not yet know the art of navigation and therefore did not explore the larger world, no man had knowledge of any arts but pre agriculture. In the '''Silver Age''', Jupiter introduces the seasons and men consequentially learn the art of agriculture and architecture. In the '''Bronze Age''', Ovid writes, men were prone to warfare, but not impiety. Finally, in the '''Iron Age''', men demarcate nations with boundaries; they learn the arts of navigation and mining; they are warlike, greedy and impious. Truth, modesty and loyalty are nowhere to be found.

==Related usage==
These mythological ages are sometimes associated with historical timelines. In the chronology of [[Saint Jerome]], the Golden Age lasts c. 1710 to 1674 BC, the Silver Age 1674 to 1628 BC, the Bronze Age 1628 to 1472 BC, the Heroic Age 1460 to 1103 BC, while Hesiod's Iron Age was considered as still ongoing by [[Saint Jerome]] in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Jerome |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_01_prefaces.htm |title=St. Jerome, Chronicle (2004-5). Preface of Jerome; Preface of Eusebius |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">The '''Agri''' were an ancient people dwelling along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. [[Strabo]] describes them as living among the [[Maeotae]], [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Sittaceni]], [[Dosci]], and [[Aspurgiani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D11 Strab. 11.2.11 at Tufts University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agri is one of the [[Maeotae]] tribes, who lived in the 1st millennium BC on the east and the southeast coast of the [[Azov sea]]. Russian scientists, archeologists, historians and ethnographers in the Soviet period concluded that the Maeotae is one of the tribes of the [[Adyghe people]] ([[Circassians]]).

In the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' in the article about the [[Adyghe people]]) it says&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/big/002/515_bolshaya-sovetskaya.htm ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. [[Sub voce|s.v.]] Adyghe]&lt;/ref&gt;"Living in the basin of the river Kuban part of the tribes ([[Adyghe people]]), as a rule, be indicated (names) of ancient historians under the collective name 'Maeotae'." In the article about the Maeotae it is written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Меоты/ ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. s.v. Maeotae]&lt;/ref&gt;"Maeotae were engaged in farming and fishing. Part of the Maeotae by the language was akin to the Adygs (Circassians), the part of the Iranians. In the 4th–3rd centuries BC many of Maeotae included in the composition of the [[Bosporan kingdom]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Argippaeans''' or '''Argippaei''' are a people mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]].'' He mentions them as north of the Scythians and much of the scholarship points to them being a tribe near the [[Ural Mountains]].

==In Herodotus==

{{quotation|
As far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been speaking is all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on a region which is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this rough country, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all—both men and women—bald from their birth, to have flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language of their own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian. They live on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum; in size it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like a bean, with a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloths; the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is called by the natives “aschy.” They lap this up with their tongues, and also mix it with milk for a drink; while they make the lees, which are solid, into cakes, and eat them instead of meat; for they have but few sheep in their country, in which there is no good pasturage. Each of them dwells under a tree, and they cover the tree in winter with a cloth of thick white felt, but take off the covering in the summer-time. No one harms these people, for they are looked upon as sacred—they do not even possess any warlike weapons. When their neighbours fall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one flies to them for refuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the Argippaeans.” |Herodotus | The Histories | Translated by George Rawlinson &lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/herodotus/h4/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This skyscraper stands on the site of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}''. (Photo taken from {{lang|fr|Rue Samaritaine}}).]]
In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romańczyk, K. M. |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.08.007 |title=Transforming Brussels into an international city — Reflections on 'Brusselization' |year=2012 |journal=Cities |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=126–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[Léon Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North–South connection|North–South railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[André de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism ===
[[File:Brusselisation in bucharest.jpg|thumb|250px|Brusselization in contemporary [[Bucharest]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}]]
In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|façadisme]]}}'' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[façade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">In [[intellectual history]] and the [[history of political thought]], the '''Cambridge School''' is a loose historiographical movement traditionally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]], where many of those associated with the School held or continue to hold academic positions, including [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], [[Peter Laslett]], [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], as well as [[David Runciman]] and [[Raymond Geuss]].

==Overview==
The Cambridge School can broadly be characterised as a [[historicism|historicist]] or [[contextualism|contextualist]] mode of interpretation, placing primary emphasis on the historical conditions and the intellectual context of the [[discourse]] of a given historical era, and opposing the perceived [[anachronism]] of conventional methods of interpretation, which it believes often distort the significance of texts and ideas by reading them in terms of distinctively modern understandings of social and political life. In these terms, the Cambridge School is 'idealist' in the sense that it accepts ideas as constitutive elements of human history in themselves, and hence contradicts social-scientific [[positivism]] in historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanheste|first=Jeroen|authorlink= |title=Guardians of the Humanist Legacy: The Classicism of T.S. Eliot's Criterion Network and Its Relevance to Our Postmodern World|url= |accessdate= |year=2007|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn= |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text often held as the original declaration of the principles of the School&lt;ref name="blackledge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge|first=Peter|authorlink= |title=Reflections on the Marxist Theory of History|url= |accessdate= |year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn= |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Quentin Skinner's 1969 article 'Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Skinner|first1=Quentin|year=1969|title=Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas|journal=History and Theory|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3–53|doi=10.2307/2504188|jstor=2504188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Skinner attacks what he describes as two "orthodoxies": "perennialism", the view that philosophers have always debated the same fundamental questions; and the notion that context is irrelevant to a historical understanding of texts, which can be read as self-standing material.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mark Bevir]]'s words, Skinner and his colleagues "defended the history of political theory against both reductionists who dismissed ideas as mere epiphenomena and canonical theorists who approached texts as timeless philosophical works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|editor1-last=Klosko|editor1-first=George|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Political Philosophy|chapter=Chapter 1. The Contextual Approach|page=14|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has been criticised on a number of fronts. On the one hand, historians working in more materialist contexts such as [[social history]] have criticised the school's focus on ideas.&lt;ref name="blackledge" /&gt; Christopher Goto-Jones has argued that the school has developed in an [[orientalism|orientalist]] direction by neglecting non-Western contributions to intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goto-Jones |first=Christopher |title=Re-politicising the Kyoto School as Philosophy |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''''' (titled '''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive''''' for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author [[Jared Diamond]], in which Diamond first defines ''collapse'':  "a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time."  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of [[societal collapse]] — particularly those involving significant influences from [[environmental change]]s, the effects of [[climate change]], hostile neighbors, [[international trade|trade partners,]] and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges— and considers the success or failure different societies have had in coping with such threats.

While the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Easter-island-moai.jpg|thumb|Diamond says [[Easter Island]] provides the best historical example of a societal collapse in isolation.]]

In the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his [[methodology]] in one paragraph:
{{quote|text=This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which [[environmental problems]] contribute. My previous book (''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Collapses of past societies ===

Diamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the forgoing four factors.

The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.

Diamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the [[Greenlandic Norse people|Greenland Norse]] to eat fish. Diamond also states that "it would be absurd to claim that [[environmental damage]] must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] is a modern counter-example, and the [[destruction of Carthage]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern societies ===
{{See also|Planetary boundaries}}

He also lists twelve [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]] facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:
# [[Deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]]
# [[Soil]] problems ([[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[soil fertility]] losses)
# [[Water management]] problems
# [[Overhunting]]
# [[Overfishing]]
# Effects of [[introduced species]] on [[native species]]
# [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]
# Increased per-capita impact of people

Further, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[Anthropogenic climate change]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buildup of [[toxin]]s in the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[energy crisis|Energy shortages]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Full human use of the Earth’s [[photosynthetic]] capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
In the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section "One-liner objections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", pages 503-514 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). In the "Further readings" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask "What can I do as an individual?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, "Further readings" section of the chapter 16, pages 569-574 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws conclusions, such as:
{{Block quote|In fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies [...] is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. [...] The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, [[resource consumption]], and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", page 509 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, he answers the question, "What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:&lt;ref name=Choices&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?", section "Reasons for hope", pages 522-524 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-term planning: "[...] the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions."&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;
* Willingness to reconsider core values: "[...] the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?"&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;

''Collapse'' is divided into four parts.
*Part One describes the environment of the US state of [[Montana]], focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.
*Part Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a "framework" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five "sets of factors" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of [[trade|trading partners]], and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates "a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole." 

The societies Diamond describes are:

* The [[Greenland]] [[Norsemen|Norse]] (cf. [[Hvalsey Church]]) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).  
* [[Easter Island]] (a society that [[History_of_Easter_Island#Destruction_of_society_and_population|collapsed]] entirely due to environmental damage)
* The [[Polynesia]]ns of [[Pitcairn Island]] (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)
* The [[Anasazi]] of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)
* The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)
* Finally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:
** The tiny egalitarian Pacific island of [[Tikopia]]
** The agricultural success of egalitarian central [[New Guinea]]
** The [[forest management]] in stratified [[Japan#Ecoregions|Japan]] of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]]-era, and in [[Germany]].

*Part Three examines modern societies, including:
** The [[Rwandan genocide|collapse into genocide of Rwanda]], caused in part by overpopulation
** The failure of [[Haiti]] compared with the relative success of its neighbor on [[Hispaniola]], the [[Dominican Republic]]
** The problems facing a [[developing country|developing nation]], [[China]]
** The problems facing a [[First World]] nation, [[Australia]]
*Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and [[globalization]], and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23). Specific attention is given to the [[polder model]] as a way [[Dutch people|Dutch]] society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p.&amp;nbsp;498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of [[Sustainability|non-sustainability]]" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.

==Reviews==
[[Tim Flannery]] gave ''Collapse'' the highest praise in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', writing:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]], [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/45.full "Learning from the past to change our future"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 307, 7 January 2005, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=While he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. [...] the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that ''Collapse'' must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.}}

''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the [[future]]. Secondly, the reviewer claimed ''Collapse'' contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of [[Starvation|starving]] people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3555894 "History on an environmental scale. Of porpoises and plantations. When communities self-destruct"], ''[[The Economist]]'', volume 374, 13 January 2005, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of British Columbia]] professor of [[ecological planning]] [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] wrote that ''Collapse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that ''Collapse'' is "a necessary antidote" to followers of [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], such as [[Bjørn Lomborg]] who authored ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Rees explained this assertion as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]], [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7021/full/433015a.html "Contemplating the abyss"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 433'', 6 January 2005, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, ''Collapse'', confronts this contradiction head-on.}}

[[Jennifer Marohasy]] of the [[think-tank]] [[Institute of Public Affairs]] wrote a critical review in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'', in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Marohasy]], [http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf "Australia's Environment: Undergoing Renewal, Not Collapse"] (PDF), ''Energy and Environment'' 16 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/03/050103crbo_books?currentPage=1 "The Vanishing"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 2005-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.}}

While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.

In 2006 the book was shortlisted for [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books]] award, eventually losing out to [[David Bodanis]]' ''Electric Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Royal Society]], [http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 "Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists"] ''[[The Royal Society]]'', 2008-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and [[slave raiding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benny Peiser|author-link=Benny Peiser|year=2005|title=From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui|journal= [[Energy &amp; Environment]] |volume= 16 No. 3&amp;4|url=http://archive.4edu.info/Youth_2007/ESY_06.5_From_Genocide_to_Ecocide.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo, [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5767/1603.full "Late Colonization of Easter Island"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Questioning Collapse'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by anthropologists criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books ''Collapse'' and ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1145682|title = Review: Questioning Collapse|last = Flexner|first = James L.|date = December 2011|journal = Pacific Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2010, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] released the documentary film ''Collapse'' based on Diamond's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715324/ ''Collapse: Based on the Book by Jared Diamond'', [[Internet Movie Database]] (page visited on 10 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26059223&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict theories''' are  perspectives in [[sociology]] and [[social psychology]] that emphasize a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] interpretation of history, [[Dialectical materialism|dialectical method]] of analysis, a critical stance toward existing social arrangements, and political program of revolution or, at least, [[reform]]. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as [[class conflict]], and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a [[Macrosociology|macro-level analysis of society]].

[[Karl Marx]] is the father of the [[social conflict theory]], which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory ''does not'' refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, [[peace and conflict studies]], or any other specific theory of [[social conflict]].

== In classical sociology ==
Of the classical founders of social science, conflict theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx (1818–1883). Based on a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] account of history, [[Marxism]] posited that [[capitalism]], like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating [[proletarian revolution]] and freedom from the [[ruling class]]es.  At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society.  Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative.  Marx rejected this type of thinking and termed it ''[[false consciousness]]'', explanations of social problems as the shortcomings of individuals rather than the flaws of society.  Marx wanted to replace this kind of thinking with something [[Friedrich Engels]] termed ''[[class consciousness]]'', the workers' recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself.  In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system.

{{Quotation|The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.|[[Karl Marx]] &amp; [[Friedrich Engels]] ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 1848|&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', introduction by Martin Malia (New York: Penguin group, 1998), pg. 35 {{ISBN|0-451-52710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{Quotation|In the social productions of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces, these relations turn into their [[fetters]]. Then an era of social revolution begins. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.

In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic – in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.

Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient, [a] [[feudal]] and modern [[bourgeois]] modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois [[mode of production]] is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.|[[Karl Marx]] ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' 1859|&lt;ref&gt;Marx ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two early conflict theorists were the Polish-Austrian sociologist and political theorist [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]] (1838–1909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist [[Lester F. Ward]] (1841–1913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx's rather exclusive focus on economic factors.

Gumplowicz, in ''Grundriss der Soziologie'' (''Outlines of Sociology'', 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by [[Cultural conflict|conflict between cultures]] and [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic]] groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from the war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex [[caste system]] develops.&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Key Sociologists: the Formative Theorists, John Scott Irving, 2007, pg 59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irving Louis Horowitz|Horowitz]] says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: "class conflict, race conflict and ethnic conflict", and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.&lt;ref&gt;"Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing", Irving Louis Horowitz, 1986, pg 281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What happened in India, [[Babylon]], Egypt, Greece and Rome may sometime happen in modern Europe. European civilization may perish, over flooded by barbaric tribes. But if any one believes that we are safe from such catastrophes he is perhaps yielding to an all too optimistic delusion. There are no barbaric tribes in our neighbourhood to be sure — but let no one be deceived, their instincts lie latent in the populace of European states.|[[Gumplowicz]] (1884)|&lt;ref&gt;"Outlines of Sociology", pg 196&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Ward directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class' [[laissez-faire]] philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. Ward's ''Dynamic Sociology'' (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self-{{Wikteng|aggrandizement}} and [[altruism]], between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a "perpetual and vigorous struggle" among various "social forces" that shaped civilization.&lt;ref&gt;"Transforming Leadership",  James MacGregor Burns, 2004, pg 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"German Realpolitik and American Sociology: an Inquiry Into the Sources and Political Significance of the Sociology of Conflict", James Alfred Aho, 1975, ch. 6 'Lester F. Ward's Sociology of Conflict'&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of [[sociological analysis]].

[[Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns "the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,"&lt;ref name="Bourricaud"&gt;Bourricaud, F. 'The Sociology of Talcott Parsons' Chicago University Press. {{ISBN|0-226-06756-4}}. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief form of [[social conflict]] that Durkheim addressed was [[crime]].  Durkheim saw crime as "a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. (1938). ''The Rules of Sociological Method.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collective consciousness|collective conscience]] defines certain acts as "criminal." Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: "[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, (1938), pp. 70–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]]'s (1864–1920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behaviour is conditioned by [[social structure]], Weber emphasized the importance of "[[social actions|social action]]," i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, C.

== Modern approaches ==
[[C. Wright Mills]] has been called the founder of ''modern conflict theory''.&lt;ref name = Knapp&gt;Knapp, P. (1994). ''One World – Many Worlds: Contemporary Sociological Theory'' (2nd Ed.). Harpercollins College Div, pp.    228–246. [http://www94.homepage.villanova.edu/peter.knapp/THgreats.htm Online summary] {{ISBN|978-0-06-501218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mills's view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the "unequal distribution of [[Power (politics)|power]] and resources in the society."&lt;ref name = Knapp/&gt; The [[power elite]] of American society, (i.e., the [[military–industrial complex]]) had "emerged from the fusion of the [[corporate elite]], [[the Pentagon]], and the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of government." Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in "increased escalation of conflict, production of [[weapons of mass destruction]], and possibly the annihilation of the human race."&lt;ref name = Knapp/&gt;

[[Gene Sharp]] (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848 | work=BBC News | title=Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook | date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his extensive writings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent struggle]], which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations9173.html Gene Sharp biography at Albert Einstein Institution web site.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112012144/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations9173.html |date=12 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state—regardless of its particular structural organization—ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the "Machiavelli of nonviolence" and the "Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare."&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Thomas.  ''Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor.''  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2004{{page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. Most recently the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|protest movement]] that toppled President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the [[Tunisian revolution|youth movement in Tunisia]] and the earlier ones in the Eastern European [[colour revolution]]s that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/world/middleeast/17sharp.html?_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | title=Shy U.S. Intellectual Created Playbook Used in a Revolution | date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears' book ''A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking'' (2008):&lt;ref&gt;Sears, Alan. (2008) ''A Good Book, In Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking.'' North York: Higher Education University of Toronto Press, pg. 34-6, {{ISBN|1-55111-536-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Societies are defined by inequality that produces conflict, rather than which produces order and consensus. This conflict based on inequality can only be overcome through a fundamental transformation of the existing relations in the society, and is productive of new social relations.
* The disadvantaged have structural interests that run counter to the [[status quo]], which, once they are assumed, will lead to social change. Thus, they are viewed as agents of change rather than objects one should feel sympathy for.
* Human potential (e.g., capacity for creativity) is suppressed by conditions of exploitation and oppression, which are necessary in any society with an unequal division of labour. These and other qualities do not necessarily have to be stunted due to the requirements of the so-called "[[socialization|civilizing process]]," or "[[Davis-Moore hypothesis|functional necessity]]": creativity is actually an engine for economic development and change.
* The role of theory is in realizing human potential and transforming society, rather than maintaining the power structure. The opposite aim of theory would be the objectivity and detachment associated with [[positivism]], where theory is a neutral, explanatory tool.
* Consensus is a euphemism for [[ideology]]. Genuine consensus is not achieved, rather the more powerful in societies are able to impose their conceptions on others and have them accept their [[discourse]]s. Consensus does not preserve social order, it entrenches stratification, a tool of the current social order.
* The [[State (polity)|State]] serves the particular interests of the most powerful while claiming to represent the interests of all. Representation of disadvantaged groups in State processes may cultivate the notion of full participation, but this is an illusion/ideology.
* Inequality on a global level is characterized by the purposeful [[underdevelopment]] of [[Third World]] countries, both during colonization and after national independence. The global system (i.e., development agencies such as [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]) benefits the most powerful countries and multi-national corporations, rather than the subjects of development, through economic, political, and military actions.

Although Sears associates the conflict theory approach with [[Marxism]], he argues that it is the foundation for much "[[feminist]], [[post-modernist]], [[anti-racist]], and [[gay liberation|lesbian-gay liberationist]] theories."&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Conflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and the [[positivist]] method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including:
* [[Critical theory]]
* [[Feminist theory]]:  An approach that recognizes women's political, social, and economic equality to men. 
* [[Postmodernism|Postmodern theory]]: An approach that is critical of modernism, with a mistrust of grand theories and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Post-structuralism|Post-structural theory]]
* [[Postcolonial theory]]
* [[Queer theory]]: A growing body of research findings that challenges the heterosexual bias in Western society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[World-systems approach|World systems theory]]
* [[Critical race theory|Race-Conflict Approach]]: A point of view that focuses on inequality and conflict between people of different racial and ethnic categories.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5294">'''Critical historiography''' approaches the [[history of art]], [[history of literature|literature]] or [[history of architecture|architecture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. Critical [[historiography]] is used by various scholars in recent decades to emphasize the ambiguous relationship between the past and the writing of history. Specifically, it is used as a method by which one understands the past and can be applied in various fields of academic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuyorganics: Organic Intellectualism, the Search for Racial Identity, and Nuyorican Thought|last=Bernard-Carreño|first=Regina|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=9781433106101|location=New York|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Concept ==
While historiography is concerned with the theory and history of historical writing, including the study of the developmental trajectory of history as a [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]], critical historiography addresses how historians or historical authors have been influenced by their own groups and loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historiography of Persian Architecture|last=Gharipour|first=Mohammad|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138915022|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is an assumption that historical sources should not be taken at face value and has to be examined critically according to scholarly criteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures of Wissenschaft des Judentums at 200|last=Thulin|first=Mirjam|publisher=Universitätsverlag Potsdam|year=2018|isbn=9783869564401|location=Potsdam|pages=70-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some authors trace the origin of this field in nineteenth-century [[Germany]], particularly with ''[[Leopold von Ranke]]'', one of the proponents of the concept of ''[[Wissenschaft]]'', which means "critical history" or "scientific history", which viewed historiography as a rigorous, critical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing: A-J|last=Woolf|first=Daniel|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=0815315147|location=New York|pages=819}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the application of ''Wissenschaft'' to the study of [[Judaism]], it is maintained that there is an implied criticism of the stand of those advocating Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said to reveal the tendency of nationalist historians to favor the pious affirmation of the orthodox in attempts to restore pride in Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-history|last=Biale|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1982|isbn=0674363329|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of critical historiography can be seen in the work of [[Harold Bloom]].  In ''Map of Misreading'', Bloom argued that poets should not be seen as autonomous agents of creativity, but rather as part of a history that transcends their own production and that to a large degree gives it shape. The historian can try to stabilize poetic production so as to better understand the work of art, but can never completely extract the historical subject from history. 

Also among those who argue for the primacy of historiography is the architectural historian [[Mark Jarzombek]]. The focus of this work is on disciplinary production rather than poetic production, as was the case with Bloom. Since psychology – which became a more or less official science in the 1880s – is now so pervasive, Jarzombek argued, but yet so difficult to pinpoint, the traditional dualism of subjectivity and objectivity has become not only highly ambiguous, but also the site of a complex negotiation that needs to take place between the historian and the discipline. The issue, for Jarzombek, is particular poignant in the fields of art and architectural history, the principal subject of the book. [[Pierre Nora]]'s notion of "ego-histories" also moves in the direction of critical historiography. The idea of these histories is to bring into focus the relationship between the personality of historians and their life choices in the process of writing of history.

A critique of critical historiography cites the risk of judging the realities of the past by the yardstick of what is true in the present so that it becomes illusory and can obscure identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FeVdNxyFiKsC&amp;pg=RA3-PT326&amp;dq=Critical+historiography+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp6umXqdDeAhUDFYgKHZDDDqYQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Critical%20historiography%20definition&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of History and Historiography|last=Tucker|first=Aviezer|date=2011-06-28|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444351521|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">'''Diocles of Peparethus''' ({{lang-el|Διοκλῆς}}; fl. late 4th – early 3rd century BC) was a historian from the Greek island of [[Peparethus]]. His works are lost, but they included histories of Persia and Rome: [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] and [[Plutarch]] acknowledge their debts to the latter as a source for their histories of early Rome, its native traditions and ancestral Greek connections.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives, Life of Romulus'', 3. Loeb edn. available at Thayer's site: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Fabius' work survives only as a brief but historically significant catalogue summary. Plutarch seems to have relied on Fabius' history but acknowledges Diocles as its basis and authority. Diocles' own sources are unknown. He may have had access to Roman sources and traditions on which he foisted Greek interpretations and interpolations.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldo Momigliano, ''The classical foundations of modern historiography'', University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton, 1990, p101; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Djv5ttMz-HYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Diocles+of+peparethus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NreVzMV8R4&amp;sig=5CfZzc2PTD3cf5-fvnNAsABbnMA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q51pS_fEOaWy0gS8pNWpCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocles%20of%20peparethus&amp;f=false]: see also Dillery, in Andrew Feldherr (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Historians, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp78-81.

Little else is known of Diocles. He appears to have been a figure of note, well travelled, and abstemious; [[Athenaeus]] cites Demetrius of Scepsis to attest that Diocles "drank cold water to the day of his death".&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus: ''The Deipnosophists'', 22 (trans.

{{Periods in English history}}

The '''Edwardian era''' or '''Edwardian period''' of [[British history]] covers the brief reign of [[King Edward VII]], 1901 to 1910, and is sometimes extended in both directions to capture long-term trends from the 1890s to the [[First World War]]. The death of [[Queen Victoria]] in January 1901 marked the end of the [[Victorian era]]. Her successor, Edward VII, was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. [[Samuel Hynes]] described the Edwardian era as a "leisurely time when women wore [[picture hat]]s and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on the British flag".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/manorhouse/edwardianlife/introduction.html "Manor House" PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals returned to power in [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]] and made [[Liberal welfare reforms|significant reforms]]. Below the upper class, the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power, such as common labourers, servants, the industrial working class, and the Irish. Women became increasingly aware of politics.&lt;ref name="Hattersley"&gt;[[Roy Hattersley]], ''The Edwardians'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptions ==
The Edwardian period is sometimes portrayed as a romantic golden age of long summer afternoons and garden parties, basking in a sun that never sets on the [[British Empire]]. This perception was created in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with nostalgia, looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the [[Great War]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 55–56, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edwardian age was also seen as a mediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding Victorian age and the catastrophe of the following war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Battiscombe |first=Georgina |year=1969 |title=Queen Alexandra |page=217 |location=London |publisher=Constable |isbn=0-09-456560-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent assessments emphasise the great differences between the wealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding great changes in political and social life.&lt;ref name="Hattersley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (Oxford UP, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lawrence James]] has argued that the leaders felt increasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the United States.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence James|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=|year=1994|isbn=978-0-349-10667-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sudden arrival of world war in summer 1914 was largely unexpected; only the Royal Navy was prepared for war.

==Politics ==
There was a growing political awareness among the [[working class]], leading to a rise in [[trade unions]], the [[Labour movement]] and demands for better working conditions. The aristocracy remained in control of top government offices.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, ''The age of upheaval: Edwardian politics, 1899–1914'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative Party===
{{main|History of the Conservative Party (UK)}}
The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] – at the time called "Unionists" – were the dominant political party from the 1890s until [[1906 UK general election|1906]]. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of [[imperialism]], tariffs, the [[Church of England]], a powerful [[Royal Navy]], and traditional hierarchical society.  There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate  that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Lawrence,  "Class and gender in the making of urban Toryism, 1880–1914." ''English Historical Review'' 108.428 (1993): 629–652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Roberts, "Popular Conservatism in Britain, 1832–1914." ''Parliamentary History'' 26.3 (2007): 387–410.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working-class Britons in the larger cities.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Brodie, "Voting in the Victorian and Edwardian East End of London." ''Parliamentary History'' 23.2 (2004): 225–248.&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, the national headquarters made highly effective use of paid traveling lecturers, with pamphlets, posters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate effectively with rural voters – particularly the newly enfranchised agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Rix, "'Go Out into the Highways and the Hedges': The Diary of Michael Sykes, Conservative Political Lecturer, 1895 and 1907–8." ''Parliamentary History'' 20#2 (2001): 209–231.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first years of the twentieth century, the Conservative government, with [[Arthur Balfour]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], had numerous successes in foreign policy, defence, and education, as well as solutions for the issues of alcohol licensing and land ownership for the peasants of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major''(2nd ed. 1985) pp 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in 1906 that they did not return to complete power until [[1922 UK general election|1922]].&lt;ref&gt;David Dutton, "Unionist Politics and the aftermath of the General Election of 1906: A Reassessment." ''Historical Journal'' 22#4 (1979): 861–876.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the retirement of the charismatic [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. There was a bitter split on [[Protectionism|"tariff reform"]] (that is, imposing tariffs or taxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] camp. Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Thompson, "Tariff reform: an imperial strategy, 1903–1913." ''Historical Journal'' 40#4 (1997): 1033–1054.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative support weakened among the top tier of the working-class and lower middle-class, and there was dissatisfaction among the intellectuals. The 1906 general election was a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, which saw its total vote share increase by 25%, while the Conservative total vote held steady.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major''(1985) pp 175–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal Party===
{{Main|Liberal Party (UK)}}
The Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Packer, "The great Liberal landslide: the 1906 General Election in perspective." ''Historian'' 89#1 (2006): 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained numerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and supporters of the Boers;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Auld, "The Liberal Pro-Boers." ''Journal of British Studies'' 14#2 (1975): 78–101.&lt;/ref&gt; near-socialists and laissez-faire classical liberals; suffragettes and opponents of women's suffrage;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''Votes for women in Britain 1867–1928'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; antiwar elements and supporters of the military alliance with France.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil M. Kaylani, "Liberal Politics and British-Foreign-Office 1906-1912-Overview." ''International Review of History and Political Science'' 12.3 (1975): 17–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Conformist Dissenters – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element, dedicated to opposing the established church in terms of education and taxation.  However, the Dissenters were losing support and society at large and played a lesser and lesser role in party affairs after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Glaser, "English Nonconformity and the Decline of Liberalism," ''American Historical Review'' 63#2 (1958), pp. 352–363 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1849549 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Party, furthermore, also included [[Irish Catholics]], and secularists from the labour movement. The middle-class business, professional and intellectual communities were generally strongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as well. The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].  One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. K. Ensor, ''England 1870–1914'' (1936) pp 384–420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England'' (1935) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.175390 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Party===
{{Main|History of the Labour Party (UK)}}
The Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing trade union movement after 1890. In 1903 it entered the [[Gladstone–MacDonald pact]] with the Liberals, allowing for cross-party support in elections, and the emergence of a small Labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement until the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own, and the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. Subtle social changes in the working-class were producing a younger generation that wanted to act independently. Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to prefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included secularised elementary education (with a disappearing role for Dissenting schools that inculcated Liberal viewpoints); the "New Unionism" after 1890 brought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled workers;&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (2004), pp 185–87.&lt;/ref&gt; and new leisure activities, especially the [[music hall]] and sports, involved youth while repelling the older generation of Liberal voters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Childs,  "Labour Grows Up: The Electoral System, Political Generations, and British Politics 1890–1929." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6#2 (1995): 123–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boer War===
{{main| Opposition to the Second Boer War }}
The government entered the [[Second Boer War]] with great confidence, little expecting that the two small rural Boer republics in southern Africa with a combined White population less than London would hold off the concentrated power of the [[British Empire]] for two and half years, and take 400,000 Imperial troops to secure victory.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (Oxford UP, 20040 pp 275–307.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war split the Liberal Party into anti- and pro-war factions. Great orators, such as  Liberal [[David Lloyd George]], who spoke against the war, became increasingly influential. Nevertheless, Liberal Unionist [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was largely in charge of the war, maintained his hold on power. When [[Herbert Kitchener|General Kitchener]] took command in 1900, he initiated a scorched earth policy in order to foil Boer guerilla tactics. Captured Boer combatants were transported overseas to other British possessions as prisoners of war. However he relocated noncombatant Boers—mostly women and children—into heavily guarded internment camps. The internment camps were overcrowded with bad sanitation and meagre food rations. Contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid and dysentery were endemic. Many of the internees died. [[Emily Hobhouse]] visited the camps and brought the conditions to the attention of the British public. Public outcry resulted in the [[Millicent Fawcett|Fawcett Commission]] which corroborated Hobhouse's report and eventually led to improved conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny De Reuck, "Social suffering and the politics of pain: Observations on the concentration camps in the Anglo-Boer War 1899-1902." ''English in Africa'' (1999) 26#2: 69-88. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40238883 in JSTOR]; [http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/iseaeng/26/2/1174.pdf?expires=1510773095&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=A198A9DA9F3DDEEA1D7943FBE707A8FE another copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boers surrendered and the Boer Republics were annexed by the British  Empire. [[Jan Smuts]]—a leading Boer general—became a senior official of the new government and even became a top British official in the World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Wrigley|title=Winston Churchill: A Biographical Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBUslUOGOgkC&amp;pg=PA311|year=2002|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, the six British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, with almost complete control of its internal affairs, but with foreign policy and defence handled by London. [[Edmund Barton]] was the first prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Irving, ''To Constitute a Nation: A Cultural History of Australia's Constitution'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Liberal reforms===
{{Further|Liberal welfare reforms}}

[[File:Ten Years of Toryism.jpg|thumb|left|Liberal poster c.1905–10]]

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] rallied Liberals around the traditional platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|the greatest electoral victory]] in Liberal Party history.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Lawrence. "Oxford DNB theme: The general election of 1906" [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95348.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] was overshadowed by his frontbench, most notably [[H. H. Asquith]] at the Exchequer, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] at the Foreign Office, [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Burdon Haldane]] at the War Office and [[David Lloyd George]] at the [[Board of Trade]]. Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and was succeeded by Asquith. He stepped up the government's radicalism, especially in the "[[People's Budget]]" of 1909 that proposed to fund expanded social welfare programmes with new taxes on land and high incomes. It was blocked by the Conservative-dominated [[House of Lords]], but eventually became law in April 1910.

[[File:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. H. Asquith]]]] 
Almost half of the Liberal MPs elected in 1906 were supportive of the '[[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]', which advocated government action to improve people's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Rees|title=Britain, 1890–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtH8GFcFSYC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2003|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch cartoon 28 April 1909.jpg|thumb|280px|"Wild Fare". Cartoonist [[John Bernard Partridge]] depicts Lloyd George as a giant with a cudgel labelled "Budget" in reference to his [[People's Budget]]; Asquith cowers beneath the table. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 28 April 1909]]

Liberals in 1906–1911 passed major legislation designed to reform politics and society, such as the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and the beginnings of the welfare state, as well as curtailing the power of the House of Lords.  Women's suffrage was not on the Liberal agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Packer, ''Liberal government and politics, 1905–15'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous major reforms helping labour, typified by the  [[Trade Boards Act 1909]] that set minimum wages in certain trades with the history of "sweated" or "sweatshop" rates of especially low wages, because of surplus of available workers, the presence of women workers, or the lack of skills. At first it applied to four industries: chain-making, ready-made tailoring, paper-box making, and the machine-made lace and finishing trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Blackburn, "Ideology and social policy: the origins of the Trade Boards Act." ''The Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 43–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later expanded to coal mining and then to other industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the [[Trade Boards Act 1918]]. Under the leadership of [[David Lloyd George]] Liberals extended minimum wages to farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Alin Howkins and Nicola Verdon. "The state and the farm worker: the evolution of the minimum wage in agriculture in England and Wales, 1909–24." ''Agricultural history review'' 57.2 (2009): 257–274. [http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/57_205HowkinsandVerdon.pdf  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative peers in the House of Lords tried to stop the [[People's Budget]]. The Liberals passed the [[Parliament Act 1911]] to sharply reduce the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] members.

===Diplomatic ties with France and Russia against Germany===
{{Main|France–United Kingdom relations|Germany–United Kingdom relations}}
Germany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] dominated European diplomacy from 1872-1890, with the determination to use the balance of power to keep the peace.  There were no wars.  Bismarck was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm in 1890, effectively decentralizing the Bismarckian Order that had been shrewdly managed and empowering French efforts to isolate Germany. With the formation of the [[Triple Entente]], Germany began to feel encircled: to the West lay France, with whom rivalry was awakening after a generation of dormancy following the Franco-Prussian War, to the East sat Russia, whose rapid industrialization worried leaders across the Continent, and in the seas, British primacy threatened a unified Germany's efforts to develop its ports and maintain its new global empire.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel R. Williamson Jr., "German Perceptions of the Triple Entente after 1911: Their Mounting Apprehensions Reconsidered" ''Foreign Policy Analysis'' 7#2 (2011): 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance.  Germany was not interested.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Koch, "The Anglo‐German Alliance Negotiations: Missed Opportunity or Myth?." ''History'' 54#182 (1969): 378-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Paris went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] linking France and Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907 which became the [[Triple Entente]]. France thus had a formal alliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Before the war: studies in diplomacy'' (1936), pp 87-186.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1903 good relations had been established with the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 345, 403–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain abandoned the policy of holding aloof from the continental powers, so called "[[Splendid Isolation]]", in the 1900s after being isolated during the [[Boer War]]. Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with her two major colonial rivals: the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France in 1904 and the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907. Britain's alignment a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy from 1898 which led to the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strachan |first=Hew |title=The First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZHITOPMf4gC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British diplomat [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock|Arthur Nicolson]] argued it was "far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2014) p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of the Triple Entente was to improve British relations with France and its ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany.   After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (1862-1933), who seldom consulted with his party leadership.  Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed  an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in Africa &lt;ref&gt;Keith Robbins, "Grey, Edward, Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862–1933)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004; online edition, 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33570, accessed 5 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], was not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic, and by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral Belgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, Britain and Germany's obligations under the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]], and in terms of British policy against any one power controlling the continent of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Hamilton, "Great Britain and France, 1911-1914" in F. H. Hinsley, ed., ''British Foreign Policy Under Sir Edward Grey'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA324  online p 324]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the last few weeks before it started in August 1914, almost no one saw a world war coming.  The expectation among the generals was that because of industrial advances any future war would produce a quick victory for the side that was better-prepared, better armed, and faster to move. No one saw that the innovations of recent decades—high explosives, long-range artillery and machine guns—were defensive weapons that practically guaranteed defeat of massed infantry attacks with very high casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Krumeich, "The War Imagined: 1890–1914." in John Horne, ed. ''A Companion to World War I'' (2012) pp 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval race with Germany===
{{Main|Anglo-German naval arms race}}
[[File:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The British ''Dreadnought'' (1906) made all battleships obsolete because it had ten long-range 12-inch big guns, mechanical computer-like range finders, high speed turbine engines that could make 21 knots, and armour plates 11 inches thick.]]
After 1805 the dominance of Britain's Royal Navy was unchallenged;  in the 1890s Germany decided to match it. Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] (1849 – 1930) dominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Epkenhans]], ''Tirpitz: Architect of the German High Seas Fleet'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1574887327/ excerpt and text search], pp 23-62&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Germany Empire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German states.  Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnought revolution]]. It made every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the lead in naval affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hoerber,  "Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of the twentieth century," ''European Security'' (2011) 20#1, pp. 65–79. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2010.547190 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a determination to retain a strong naval advantage, the British lacked a military strategy or plans for a major war.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Seligmann, "Failing to Prepare for the Great War? The Absence of Grand Strategy in British War Planning before 1914" ''War in History'' (2017) 24#4 414-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The Edwardian era stands out as a time of peace and prosperity. There were no severe depressions, and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output and [[GDP]] (but not GDP per capita) fell behind its rivals, the United States and Germany, but the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dormois and Michael Dintenfass, eds., ''The British Industrial Decline'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and there was a striking preference for leisure over entrepreneurship among the elite. However, major achievements should be underlined. [[London]] was the financial centre of the world—far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations. It had huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways. These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. The amenities, especially in urban life, were accumulating—prosperity was highly visible. The working classes were beginning to protest politically for a greater voice in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues was not high until about 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J Taylor, "The Economy", in Simon Nowell-Smith, ed., ''Edwardian England: 1901–1914'' (1964) pp. 105–138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social change and improved health==
By the late-1880s, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had created new technologies that changed the way people lived. The growth of industry shifts in manufacturing factories, special-purpose machinery and technological innovations, which led to increased productivity. [[Gender roles]] shifted as women made use of the new technology to upgrade their lifestyle and their career opportunities.

Mortality declined steadily in urban England and Wales 1870–1917. Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell looked statistically at those factors in the physical environment (especially population density and overcrowding) that raised death rates directly, as well as indirect factors such as price and income movements that affected expenditures on sewers, water supplies, food, and medical staff. The statistical data show that increases in the incomes of households and increases in town tax revenues helped cause the decline of mortality. The new money permitted higher spending on food, and also on a wide range of health-enhancing goods and services such as medical care. The major improvement in the physical environment was the quality of the housing stock, which rose faster than the population; its quality was increasingly regulated by central and local government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell, "Economic factors in the decline of mortality in late nineteenth century Britain," ''European Review of Economic History'' 2#3 (1998) pp. 263–288 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41377834 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Infant mortality]] fell faster in England and Wales than in Scotland. Clive Lee argues that one factor was the continued overcrowding in Scotland's housing.&lt;ref&gt;Clive H. Lee, "Regional inequalities in infant mortality in Britain, 1861–1971: patterns and hypotheses." ''Population Studies'' 45.1 (1991): 55–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the First World War, infant mortality fell sharply across the country. J.M. Winter attributes this to the full employment and higher wages paid to war workers.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Winter,  "Aspects of the impact of the First World War on infant mortality in Britain." ''Journal of European Economic History'' 11.3 (1982): 713.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising status of women===
For housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready made clothing and made it easier for women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues Barbara Burman, "home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burman, "Made at Home by Clever Fingers: Home Dressmaking in Edwardian England," in Barbara Burman, ed. ''The Culture of Sewing: Gender, Consumption, and Home Dressmaking'' (1999) p 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased literacy in the [[middle-class]] gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her tastes and help define femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Beetham, ''A magazine of her own?: domesticity and desire in the woman's magazine, 1800–1914'' (Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems offered middle-class women increased employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Guerriero R. Wilson, "Women's work in offices and the preservation of men's 'breadwinning'jobs in early twentieth-century Glasgow." ''Women's History Review'' 10#3 (2001): 463–482.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Anderson, ''The white-blouse revolution: female office workers since 1870'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  So too did the rapid expansion of the school system,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Dyhouse, ''Girls growing up in late-Victorian and Edwardian England'' (Routledge, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of the new profession of nursing.  Education and status led to demands for female roles in the rapidly expanding world of sports.&lt;ref&gt;Cartriona M. Parratt, "Athletic 'Womanhood': Exploring sources for female sport in Victorian and Edwardian England." ''Journal of Sport History'' 16#2 (1989): 140–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were very active in church affairs, including attendance at services, Sunday school teaching, fund raising, pastoral care, social work and support for international missionary activities.  They quietly submitted to their almost complete exclusion from practically all leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ottewill, "'Skilful and Industrious': Women and Congregationalism in Edwardian Hampshire 1901–1914." ''Family &amp; Community History'' 19#1 (2016): 50-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's suffrage====
{{Main|Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom}}
As middle-class women rose in status they increasingly supported demands for a political voice.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Pugh, ''Women's suffrage in Britain, 1867–1928'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[June Purvis]], "Gendering the Historiography of the Suffragette Movement in Edwardian Britain: some reflections." ''[[Women's History Review]]'' 22#4 (2013): 576-590.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was significant support for woman suffrage in all the parties, but the Liberal Party was in control after 1906 and a handful of its leaders, especially [[H. H. Asquith]], blocked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Roberts|title=Britain, 1846-1964: The Challenge of Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gwc0Rlq8al4C&amp;pg=RA1-PT80|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous organisations which did their work quietly.  After 1897 they were increasingly linked together by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) led by [[Millicent Fawcett]].  However front page publicity was seized by the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). Founded in 1903, it was tightly controlled by the three Pankhursts, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] (1858–1928), and her daughters [[Christabel Pankhurst]] (1880–1958) and [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] (1882–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Marcus, ''Suffrage and the Pankhursts'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  It specialized in highly visible publicity campaigns such as large parades. This had the effect of energizing all dimensions of the suffrage movement. While there was a majority of support for suffrage in parliament, the ruling Liberal Party refused to allow a vote on the issue; the result of which was an escalation in the suffragette campaign. The WSPU, in dramatic contrast to its allies, embarked on a campaign of violence to publicize the issue, even to the detriment of its own aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/womens-history/suffrage/|title=The Struggle for Suffrage {{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Phillips, ''The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas behind it'' (Abacus, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth control====
Although abortion was illegal, it was nevertheless the most widespread form of birth control in use.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Patricia|title=Women and Abortion in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=History Workshop|year=1977|volume=4|pages=57–68|doi=10.1093/hwj/4.1.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used predominantly by [[working-class]] women, the procedure was used not only as a means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who transported [[contraceptive]]s could be legally punished.  Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a high failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not need any prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell [[abortifacient]]s indirectly.&lt;ref name="mclaren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaren|first=Angus|title=Abortion in England 1890–1914|journal=Victorian Studies|year=1977|pages=379–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of society was accepting of contraceptives or abortion, and the opposition viewed both as part of one and the same sin. Abortion was much more common among the middle-classes than among those living in rural areas, where the procedure was not readily available. Women were often tricked into purchasing ineffective pills. In addition to fearing legal reprimands, many physicians did not condone abortion because they viewed it as an immoral procedure potentially endangering a woman's life.&lt;ref name="mclaren" /&gt; Because abortion was illegal and physicians refused to perform the procedure, local women acted as abortionists, often using crochet hooks or similar instruments.&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt;

Feminists of the era focused on educating and finding jobs for women, leaving aside the controversial issues of contraceptives and abortion, which in popular opinion were often related to promiscuity and prostitution. The Church condemned abortion as immoral and a form of rebellion against the child-bearing role women were expected to assume. Many considered abortion to be a selfish act that allowed a woman to avoid personal responsibility, contributing to a decline in moral values.&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt; Abortion was often a solution for women who already had children and did not want more. Consequently, the size of families decreased drastically.&lt;ref name="mclaren" /&gt;

====Poverty among working-class women====
The [[1834 Poor Law]] defined who could receive monetary relief. The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid. The law did not recognise single independent women, and lumped women and children into the same category.  If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as disabled under the law. Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse, receiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending church on Sundays.  During marriage disputes women often lost the rights to their children, even if their husbands were abusive.&lt;ref name=thane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thane|first=Pat|authorlink = Pat Thane|title=Women and the Poor Law in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=History Workshop|year=1978|pages=29–51|doi=10.1093/hwj/6.1.29|jstor=4288190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged for at least four reasons. First, women lived longer, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women had fewer opportunities to work, and when they did find it, their wages were lower than male workers' wages. Thirdly, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt;

====Female servants====
Edwardian Britain had large numbers of male and female [[domestic servant]]s, in both urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=benson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benson|first=John|title=One Man and His Woman: Domestic Service in Edwardian England|journal=Labour History Review|year=2007|volume=72|issue=3|pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle and upper-class women relied on servants to run their homes smoothly. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion.&lt;ref name=davidoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Lenore|title=Mastered for Life: Servant and Wife in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=Society for the Study of Labour History|year=1973|volume=73|issue=27|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian era due to a declining number of young people willing to be employed in this area.&lt;ref name=pooley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pooley|first=Sian|title=Domestic Servants and Their Urban Employers: A Case Study of Lancaster 1880–1914|journal=The Economic History Review|year=2008|volume=62|issue=2|pages=405–429|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00459.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
{{main|1900s in fashion}}
[[File:Women dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg|thumb|300px|A cartoon in ''Punch'' (1911) compares changes in fashion between 1901 and 1911. "The dowdy voluminous clothes of the earlier date, making the grandmother an old lady and the mother seem plain, had been replaced by much simpler looser wear producing a sense of release for all three females."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Read, ''Edwardian England 1901-15: society and politics'' (1972) pp 257-58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The upper-classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid developments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were needed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Constanzo, "'One Can't Shake Off the Women': Images of Sport and Gender in Punch, 1901–10." ''The International journal of the history of sport'' 19#1 (2002): 31–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cosbey, Mary Lynn Damhorst, and Jane Farrell-Beck. "Diversity of daytime clothing styles as a reflection of women's social role ambivalence from 1873 through 1912." ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'' 21#3 (2003): 101–119.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight [[corset]], or [[bodice]], and dressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets in everyday life. According to [[Arthur Marwick]], the most striking change of all the developments that occurred during the Great War was the modification in women's dress, "for, however far politicians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after the war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women's skirts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |title=The Deluge. British Society and the First World War |edition= Second |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Macmillan |year=1991 |page=151 |isbn=0-333-54846-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Tea Gown' was one of the Fashion creations during the Edwardian era and when women starting to stop wearing corsets. More Afternoon and Tea parties were being held and for longer amongst the upper classes, thus the trend of the 'Tea Gown' was created. The Tea Gown was worn to receive guests. The fabric choices are usually sweet pea shades in chiffon, mousse line de sore, tulle with feather boas and lace. Lace was a ‘must-have’ in the Edwardian wardrobe. It represents femininity and wealth. ‘High and boned collars for the day; plugging off shoulder décolleté for the evening’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/740627215|title=Fashion : a visual history from regency &amp; romance to retro &amp; revolution : a complete illustrated chronology of fashion from the 1800s to the present day|last=J.|first=Stevenson, N.|date=2012|origyear=2011|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=9780312624453|edition= 1st U.S. |location=New York|oclc=740627215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tea Gown's cuttings are relatively loose comparing to the evening gown's. The flow is quite feminine, usually decorated with lace. In which, Irish crochet was the more affordable alternative. Women often wore the tea gown un-corseted in order to create an atmosphere of daring intrigue in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50081013|title=Costume and fashion : a concise history|last=1899-1975.|first=Laver, James,|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|others=De La Haye, Amy., Tucker, Andrew (Fashion journalist)|isbn=0500203482|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=50081013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long kid gloves, a flat pancake hat and held laced parasols on hand were always the choice of women's Fashion accessories. Parasols are different than umbrellas. The parasols that were widely use during the Edwardian era are not waterproof, they are made of fabric. It was not designed for functionality, but as a Fashion ornament. Over time, decorative ornaments became heavier, i.e. the hats, sleeves and hem. By the end of the Edwardian era, the hat is bigger in size, with more decorations like feathers and one or more plumes on top.

The Edwardians developed new styles in clothing design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from "La Mode Illustrée"|last=Olian|first=JoAnne|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1998|isbn=9780486297118|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Victorian Era is associated with large, ankle-length, heavy, dark velvet gowns and bustles for the classes that could afford them, the Edwardian era favored more tightly fitting skirts and dresses made of lightweight fabrics designed for a more active lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Beth Presley, "Fifty years of change: Societal attitudes and women's fashions, 1900–1950." ''Historian'' 60#2 (1998): 307–324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2 pieces dress came into vogue. Skirts hung tight at the hips and flared at the hem, creating a trumpet of lily-like shape.
* Skirts in 1901 had decorated hems with ruffles of fabric and lace.
* Some dresses and skirts featured trains.
* Tailored jackets, first introduced in 1880, increased in popularity and by 1900, tailored suits became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Harris, ''Victorian &amp; Edwardian Fashions for Women, 1840 to 1919'' (Schiffer Publishing, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;
* By 1904, skirts became fuller and less clingy.
* In 1905, skirts fell in soft folds that curved in, then flared out near the hemlines.
* From 1905 – 1907, waistlines rose.
* In 1901, the [[hobble skirt]] was introduced; a tight fitting skirt that restricted a woman's stride.
* [[Lingerie dress]]es, or tea gowns made of soft fabrics, festooned with ruffles and lace were worn indoors.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Edwards,  "'Clad in Robes of Virgin White': The Sexual Politics of the 'Lingerie'Dress in Novel and Film Versions of The Go-Between." ''Adaptation'' 5#1 (2012): 18–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Around 1913 women's dresses acquired a lower and sometimes V-shaped neckline in opposition to the high collars a generation before.  This was considered a scandal and caused an outrage among the clergy throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Gernsheim1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alison Gernsheim|title=Victorian &amp; Edwardian Fashion: A Photographic Survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Si-yrdMImAC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1963|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-24205-7|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
The turn of the century saw the rise of popular journalism aimed at the lower middle class and tending to deemphasise highly detailed political and international news, which remain the focus of a handful of low-circulation prestige newspapers. They were family-owned and operated, and were primarily interested not in profits but in influence on the nation's elite by their control of the news and editorials on serious topics.  The new press they reached vastly larger audiences by emphasis on sports, crime, sensationalism, and gossip about famous personalities. Detailed accounts of major speeches and complex international events were not printed. [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] was the chief innovator.&lt;ref&gt;R.C.K. Ensor, England, 1870-1914 (1936) pp 309-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  He used his ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' to transform the media along the American model of "[[Yellow Journalism]]".  [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] said he was "the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street".&lt;ref&gt;Lord Beaverbrook, ''Politicians and the War, 1914–1916'' (1928) 1:93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmsworth made a great deal of money, but during the [[First World War]] he also wanted political power.  For that he purchased the highest prestige newspaper, ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Thompson, "Fleet Street Colossus: The Rise and Fall of Northcliffe, 1896–1922." ''Parliamentary History'' 25.1 (2006): 115-138.&lt;/ref&gt;   P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: 
{{quote|More than anyone [he] ... shaped the modern press. Developments he introduced or harnessed remain central: broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control.&lt;ref&gt;P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure, "Northcliffe, Viscount." in John Ramsden, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century British Politics'' (2002) p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The arts==
[[File:Peter Pan (2733740964).jpg|thumb|[[Peter Pan statue]], [[Kensington Gardens]]]]
The Edwardian era corresponds to the French ''[[Belle Époque]]''. Despite its brief pre-eminence, the period is characterised by its own unique architectural style, fashion, and lifestyle. [[Art Nouveau]] had a particularly strong influence. Artists were influenced by the development of the automobile and electricity, and a greater awareness of human rights.

In November 1910, [[Roger Fry]] organised the exhibition ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'' at the [[Grafton Galleries]], London. This exhibition was the first to prominently feature [[Gauguin]], [[Manet]], [[Matisse]], and [[Van Gogh]] in England and brought their art to the public. He followed it up with the ''Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition'' in 1912.

[[George Frampton]]'s [[statue of Peter Pan]], "erected in Hyde Park in 1912 ... immediately became a source of contention, sparking debate about the role of public statuary and its role in spaces of recreation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1121 Linkof, Ryan. review of ''The Edwardian Sense: Art, Design, and Performance in Britain, 1901–1910'', (review no. 1121), Institute of Historical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In fiction, some of the best-known names are [[J. M. Barrie]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Kenneth Grahame]], [[M. R. James]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[James Joyce]], [[A.A. Milne]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Edith Nesbit]], [[Beatrix Potter]], [[Saki]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]],  and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Apart from these famous writers, this was a period when a great number of novels and short stories were being published, and a significant distinction between "[[highbrow]]" literature and [[popular fiction]] emerged. Among the most famous works of literary criticism was [[A. C. Bradley]]'s ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' (1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Priestley |first=J. B. |authorlink = J. B. Priestley|year=1970 |title=The Edwardians |pages=176–178 |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=0-434-60332-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Live performances, both amateur and professional, were popular. [[Henry Wood]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Arnold Bax]], [[George Butterworth]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Thomas Beecham]] were all active. Military and brass bands often played outside in parks during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new technology of [[wax cylinders]] played on [[phonograph]]s, made live performances permanently available for repetition at any time.

===Performing arts===
Cinema was primitive and audiences preferred live performances to picture shows. [[Music hall]] was very popular and widespread; influential performers included male impersonator [[Vesta Tilley]] and comic [[Little Tich]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 172–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most successful playwright of the era was [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. In 1908, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards. Maugham's plays, like his novels, usually had a conventional plot structure, but the decade also saw the rise of the so-called New Drama, represented in plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Harley Granville Barker]], and Continental imports by [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Gerhardt Hauptmann]]. The actor/manager system, as managed by [[Sir Henry Irving]], [[George Alexander (actor)|Sir George Alexander]], and [[Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], was in decline.

===Architecture===
{{see also|Edwardian architecture}}
Notable architects included [[Edwin Lutyens]], [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and [[Giles Gilbert Scott]]. In spite of the popularity of [[Art Nouveau]] in Europe, the [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque]] style of architecture was widely favoured for public structures and was a revival of [[Christopher Wren]]–inspired designs of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The change or reversal in taste from the Victorian eclectic styles corresponded with the historical revivals of the period, most prominently earlier [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Gray, ''Edwardian Architecture: A Biographical Dictionary'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[White City Stadium]] for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] was the first Olympic Stadium in the UK. Built on the site of the [[Franco-British Exhibition]], it had a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908. It was the largest structure of its type in the world, and was designed to be  awesome and enhance the love of large-scale spectacle that characterised Edwardian London.&lt;ref&gt;David Littlefield,  "White City: The Art of Erasure and Forgetting the Olympic Games." ''Architectural Design'' 82#1 (2012): 70–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Filmmakers [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] documented many scenes from Britain and Ireland from 1900–1907, sports, parades, factory exits, parks, city streets, boating and the like. Their films have survived in very good quality restored from the original negatives.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Toulmin and Simon Popple, eds., ''The Lost World of Mitchell and Kenyon: Edwardian Britain on Film'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see for example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNVthr44XqU "The Lost World Of Mitchell And Kenyon – Episode 1 – 4/6"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==
The period featured many innovations. [[Ernest Rutherford]] published his studies on [[radioactivity]]. The first transatlantic wireless signals were sent by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], and the [[Wright brothers]] flew for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Ubbelohde, "Edwardian Science and Technology: Their Interactions", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1963) 1#3 pp. 217–226 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4024921 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the era, [[Louis Blériot]] had crossed the [[English Channel]] by air; the largest ship in the world, [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], had sailed on its maiden voyage and her larger sister [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was under construction; automobiles were common; and the [[South Pole]] was reached for the first time by [[Roald Amundsen]]'s and then [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s teams.

==Sport==
[[File:London 1908 Steeplechasea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1908 Summer Olympics in London: The water jump in the [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]]]]
The [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympic Games]] were held in London. Popularity of sports tended to conform to class divisions, with tennis and yachting popular among the very wealthy and [[Association football|football]] favoured by the working class.&lt;ref&gt;James Anthony Mangan, ed. ''A sport-loving society: Victorian and Edwardian middle-class England at play'' (Routledge, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Football ===
[[Aston Villa]] maintained their position as the pre-eminent football team of the era, winning the [[FA Cup]] for the fourth time in 1904–05 and their sixth League title in 1909–10. The club colours of claret and sky blue were adopted by [[Burnley FC|Burnley]] as a tribute to their success in 1910. Sunderland achieved their fourth league title in 1901–02. The era also saw [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (1900–01, 1905–06), [[Newcastle United]] (1904–05, 1906–07, 1908–09) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (1907–08) winning their first league titles.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Mason, "'Our Stephen and our Harold': Edwardian footballers as local heroes." ''The International Journal of the History of Sport'' 13#1 (1996): 71–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21150">The '''European Association of History Educators''' (EUROCLIO) was established in 1992 with the support of the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[NGO]] works as a European wide facilitator for innovation and progress in history Education. The organisation contributes not only to the development, but also on the actual implementation of regional, national and European long-term projects, which focus on establishing knowledge, experience and expertise in the countries by training and consulting teachers. EUROCLIO develops teaching materials, builds and maintains professional Networks and acts as advisor to governments, international organisations, [[NGO]]s, History Teacher Associations and other Organisations. EUROCLIO is supported by the [[Europe for Citizens]] Programme of the European Union and has, for many years, Official Participatory Status and is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Stake Holder's Network in Education and Training.

== Background ==

=== History ===
EUROCLIO was officially founded in 1993, but already in 1992, delegates from [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (14 countries), representing 18 history Teachers Associations decided that a European organization was needed to support the learning and teaching of history by sharing and exchanging knowledge and professional experience. EUROCLIO was founded by [[Joke van der Leeuw-Roord]]. The immediate cause for the foundation of such an institute was the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 and the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1992. These events changed the scope and perspective of history and history education in Europe completely and for many countries, a European dimension in history education suddenly became possible and important for the future. History education is frequently used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]], hatred and aggression, but now the decision was made to renew contacts between East and West and reinforce a history education that could act as a tool to foster integration, peace and stability in Europe. From 1993 on, EUROCLIO grew rapidly and today it represents 64 member organizations from 46 (mostly) European countries, connecting 40,000 historians and history educators in primary, secondary and higher educational institutes.

== The organisation ==

=== Mission  ===

The organization supports the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

EUROCLIO focuses on three target areas:
* Intense professional capacity building and knowledge exchange, with a focus on the development of innovative and responsible high quality teaching professionals and the development and implementation of contemporary, class-room applicable teaching materials.
*  Dialogue, national, cross-community and trans-border networking and dissemination of information with the goal of maintaining and extending this network through all means available.
* Developing participatory and sustainable, professional civil society networks by establishing and empowering independent History Educators Associations in all European countries and beyond. These organisations act as multipliers of the EUROCLIO work on national levels.

== Activities ==

=== Teacher Training and Conferences ===

Each year, EUROCLIO organises an International Training and Development Course where, on average, History Educators from more than 35 countries meet, learn and discuss a variety of topics and good practice to broaden their perspectives. These Annual Conferences take place in different countries and in close co-operation with local History Teachers’ Associations. In 2009, the Conference was in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], on the theme “Taking the Perspective of the Others: Intercultural Dialogue and History Teaching”. This Conference is co-organised by nine Teacher Unions and History Educators’ Associations from across the divide.

All EUROCLIO Teacher Training activities are in close co-operation with both local academics and institutes for history teacher education, and international experts to train history teachers how to use the most modern teaching methods in their classes. For example: history educators everywhere recognise the importance of ICT as a learning and communications tool, and want further training in how to develop these areas and how to extend their skills in using ICT to promote historical understanding and learning. EUROCLIO operates through the medium of English for international work, and in home languages with translations for the experts supporting projects and in developmental work.

Since its foundation, EUROCLIO has organised more than 30 International Conferences and more than 70 National and Regional Training and Development Courses.

=== Programmes ===

EUROCLIO implements several long term programmes:
* '''International Trainings''' provides cross-border professional capacity building for history, heritage and citizenship educators related to innovative and responsible history education.
* '''Historiana - Your Portal to the Past''' promotes digital literacy through history, heritage and citizenship education by means of an on-line multimedia tool, offering students multi-perspective, cross-border and comparative historical resources supplementing their national history teaching tools.
* '''History that Connects in the Western Balkans''' restores the professional relations between history, heritage and citizenship educators and explores opportunities for a collaborative approach to teaching history in the region, including sensitive and controversial issues.
* '''Mediterranean Dialogues''' enables educators across the Euro-Mediterranean region to open a common dialogue, to share experiences and to develop cross-community and cross-border cooperation and networks.
* '''Innovating History Education in the Black Sea Region''' raises awareness in this region for approaches in history, heritage and citizenship education, which enhance democracy and intercultural dialogue and is creating sustainable national and cross border networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">'''French Israelism''' (also called '''Franco-Israelism''') is the belief that people of [[Franks|Frankish]] descent are also the direct lineal descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], and it is often accompanied by the belief that the [[Merovingian dynasty]] is directly descended from the [[Davidic line|line of King David]].
 
One of the earliest scholars who claimed that he could trace the ten lost tribes of Israel to [[France]] was the French [[Huguenot]] writer, [[Jakob Abbadie|Jacques Abbadie]], who fled French [[Anti-Protestantism|Roman Catholic persecution]] and later settled in [[London]], [[England]]. In his important 1723 work, ''The Triumph Of Providence'', he wrote:

{{quote|God opened, as one might say, the tomb of the Ten Tribes by the conversion of the Northern Peoples... Certainly, unless the Ten Tribes have flown into the air, or been plunged into the center of the earth, we must look for them in the North, and in that part of the North, which at the time of Constantine was converted to the Christian faith...The Ten Tribes have since seen conversion into Christian nations, which they are, having thousands of God-fearing ministers in their midst, a people marked by physical possession of the Gospel as servants of God, and reunited with many of their brethren of Judah in the Christian church. This explanation allows us to see the historical fulfillment of the prophetic picture in the Gothic warriors, prepared for conquest, destined for empire, and ancestors of the tribes who inhabit this nation [France].(Translation from the French by M.F. Bennett, ''The Servant People'', [http://israelite.ca/research/questionboxfiles.html/france.html])}}

The claim became the foundation for the [[Priory of Sion]] hoax created by [[Pierre Plantard]] and [[Philippe de Chérisey]] in the 1960s, and it was further popularized in 1982 with the book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'',&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;Henry Lincoln, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Corgi, 1982. {{ISBN|0-552-12138-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2003 with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
;1714:Upon the death of his second cousin '''[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]''', ''George Louis, Elector of Hanover'' succeeds as the new King, '''[[George I of Great Britain|George I]]''', of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the former of which had itself been established in 1707. This is the beginning of the [[House of Hanover]]'s reign over the [[British Crown]].

;1715:[[Whig (British political faction)|The Whig Party]] wins the [[British general election, 1715|British Parliamentary Election]] for the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. This party is dominant until 1760.

;1727:'''George I''' dies on 11 June. His son ''George, Prince of Wales'' ascends to the throne as '''[[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'''

;1746:The [[Jacobite rising of 1745|final Jacobite rising]] is crushed at the [[Battle of Culloden]].

;1760:'''George II''' dies on 25 October, and his grandson ''George, Prince of Wales'' ascends to the throne as '''[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]''', since his father, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], had died on 31 March 1751.

;1763:Britain is [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|victorious in the Seven Years' War]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris of 1763]] grants Britain domain over vast new territories around the world. &lt;!-- Note that there have been many significant Treaties of Paris, and hence the year is necessary. --&gt;

;1765:The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] is passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], causing much unrest in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America.

;1769–1770:Australia and New Zealand are claimed as [[Great Britain|British]] colonies.

;1773:The [[Inclosure Act 1773]] is put into place by the British Parliament. This act brought about the [[enclosure]] of land and removing the right of [[common land]] access. This began an internal mass movement of rural poor from the countryside into the cities.

;1775:The [[American War of Independence|War of Independence]] begins in the Thirteen Colonies, specifically in [[Massachusetts]].

;1776:The Thirteen Colonies in North America [[U.S. Declaration of Independence|declare their independence]] from the [[British Crown]] and British Parliament.

;1781:The British Army in America under [[Lord Cornwallis]] surrenders to [[George Washington]] after its defeat in [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown, Virginia]] in October 1781.

;1783:Great Britain formally recognises the [[American Revolution|independence of the original 13 American States]] when the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]] is signed by [[David Hartley (the Younger)|David Hartley]], representing [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and by the American treaty delegation.

;1788:Australia is settled through [[penal transportation]] to the colony of [[New South Wales]] from 26 January.

;1789:[[Thomas Robert Malthus]], an Anglican cleric authors ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. This work, the origin of [[Malthusianism]], posited a need for [[population control]] to avoid poverty and famine or conflict over scare resources.

;1801:The [[Act of Union 1800]] comes into effect on 1 January, uniting the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]

;1807: The [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act]] became law, making it illegal to engage in the [[slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]], partly as a result of a twenty-year parliamentary campaign by [[William Wilberforce]].

;1811:''George, Prince of Wales'' begins his nine-year period as the [[Prince Regent|regent]] (he became known as ''[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince Regent]]'') for George III, who had become delusional. This sub-period of the Georgian Era is known as the [[British Regency|Regency era]].

;1815:[[Napoleon I of France]] is defeated by the [[Hundred Days|Seventh Coalition]] under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], in what is now [[Wallonia]], Belgium.

;1819:The [[Peterloo Massacre]] occurs.

;1820:'''[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]''' dies on 29 January, and his son ''George, Prince Regent'' ascends to the throne of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] as '''[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]'''.

;1830:'''[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]''' dies on 26 June. According to some authorities, this is the end of the Georgian era of the House of Hanover. However, many other authorities continue this era during the relatively short reign of his younger brother, ''The Prince William, Duke of Clarence'', who became '''[[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'''.

;1833: [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] passed by Parliament through the influence of William Wilberforce and the Evangelical movement, thus criminalising slavery within the British Empire.

;1837:'''William IV''' dies on 20 June, ending the Georgian Era. In the United Kingdom, he was succeeded by his niece, '''[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]''', the last member of the House of Hanover. She married [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who was of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], and so, when their son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales succeeded as '''[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]''', that House gained the British throne. In the Kingdom of Hanover, William IV is succeeded by his younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]].

Within the field of [[social evolution]], '''Hamiltonian spite''' is a term for behaviours occurring among conspecifics that have a cost for the actor and a negative impact upon the recipient.

==Theories on altruism and spitefulness==

[[W. D. Hamilton]] published an influential paper on [[altruism]] in 1964 to explain why genetic kin tend to help each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. Part  I and II. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7: 1–16 and 17–52.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that genetically related individuals are likely to carry the copies of the same [[alleles]]; thus, helping kin may ensure that copies of the actors' alleles pass onto next generations of both the recipient and the actor.

While this became a widely accepted idea, it was less noted that Hamilton published a later paper that modified this view.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1970. Selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model. Nature 228: 1218–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper argues that by measuring the genetic relatedness between any two (randomly chosen) individuals of a population several times, we can identify an average level of relatedness. Theoretical models predict that (1) it is adaptive for an individual to be altruistic to any other individuals that are more closely related to it than this average level, and also that (2) it is adaptive for an individual to be spiteful against any other individuals that are less closely related to it than this average level. The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself. Hamilton mentioned birds and fishes exhibiting [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] (more specifically: ovicide) as examples for such behaviours.

Briefly, an individual can increase the chance of its genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations either by helping those that are more closely related, or by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery WL, Brown JS, FitzGerald GJ 2003. Spite: altruism’s evil twin. Oikos, 102, 413–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster KR, Wenseleers T, Ratnieks FLW 2001. Spite: Hamilton’s unproven theory. Annales Zoologici Fennici 38: 229–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubts about the adaptive nature of spiteful behaviour==

Though altruism and spitefulness appear to be two sides of the same coin, the latter is less accepted among evolutionary biologists.

First, unlike the case with the beneficiary of an altruistic act, targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge: bites will provoke bites. Thus harming non-kin may be more costly than helping kins.

Second, presuming a [[Panmixia|panmictic population]], the vast majority of pairs of individuals exhibit a roughly average level of relatedness. For a given individual, the majority of others are not worth helping or harming. While it is easy to identify the few most closely related ones (see: [[kin recognition]]), it is hard to identify the most genetically distant ones.

Most terrestrial [[vertebrates]] exhibit a certain degree of site fidelity, so levels of kinship tend to correlate negatively with spatial distance. While this may provide some cues to identify the least related individuals, it may also ensure that non-kin rarely if ever meet each other.

==Spiteful behaviour in animals==
===Infanticide===

Many animal species exhibit infanticide, i.e. adults tend to kill the eggs or the offspring of conspecifics, even if they do not feed on them (in the absence of [[cannibalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;van Schaik CP, Janson CH (eds.) 2000. Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of spitefulness is relatively free from the threat of revenge – provided that the parents and relatives of the target are either weak or far away. Infanticide may not be a form of spite as in many cases the loss of offspring to the female brings it back into estrous providing a mating advantage to an infanticidal male. This is seen in lions. &lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik, C. P., &amp; Janson, C. H. (Eds.). (2000). Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Meles meles MHNT.jpg|thumb|210px|When infected by tuberculosis, badgers emigrate from their natal group.]]

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

An individual carrying a long-lasting infection of virulent pathogens may benefit from (1) channelling the flow of pathogens from its own body away from its kin and (2) directing them toward non-kin conspecifics. The adaptive nature of this behaviour has been supported by the analysis of theoretical models &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/transmission.pdf Rózsa L 1999. Influencing random transmission is a neutral character in hosts. Journal of Parasitology, 85, 1032–35.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~fadionisio/Selfish_and_Spiteful_behaviour_parasites_pathogens2007.pdf Dionisio F 2007. Selfish and spiteful behaviour through parasites and pathogens. Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9: 1199-1210]&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the analyses of the behavioural repertoire of different animal species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/spite.pdf Rózsa L 2000. Spite, xenophobia, and collaboration between hosts and parasites. Oikos 91: 396–400.]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[tuberculosis]]-infected [[European badger]]s and [[rabies]]-infected [[dog]]s equally tend to emigrate from their natal ranges before starting to distribute the pathogens. Similarly, wild herds of [[Asian elephants]] tend to defecate into drinkwater holes apparently to keep rival herds away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct102005/1184.pdf Jog M, Watve M 2005. Role of parasites and commensals in shaping host behaviour. Current Science 89: 1184–91]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lüen Kindermord.jpg|thumb|330px|Wartime infanticide is a characteristic aspect of human aggression.]]

==Spiteful behaviour in humans==
===Wartime infanticide===

Throughout human history, [[war]] often emerges as a costly form of aggression typically targeting the non-kin enemy. Naturally, most wars appear to be motivated by potential benefits other than the genetic. Nevertheless, the widespread occurrence of [[rape]]{{citation needed|reason=Don't the following sentences contradict this?|date=August 2013}} and [[infanticide]] during periods of war indicates Hamiltonian elements as well. Infanticide is a biologically spiteful action in that it costs the killer time and energy, and opens the killer to the threat of revenge, without any direct compensating benefits.{{citation needed|reason=While such a behavior *may* be spiteful, it does not match the definition of Hamiltonian spite we give|date=August 2013}} Rape, by contrast, is not, in the strict definition of the word, biologically spiteful as it is likely to have a direct fitness increase on the rapist (by increasing his number of direct descendants in the next generation, should the victim fall pregnant).

It was recently suggested that spiteful motivations may also play a role in economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Boari M 2007. The ethics of rationality. Elucidations in the theoretical foundations of economics by relation to ethics. In: Vranceanu R, Djelic M-L, editors. Moral foundations of management knowledge. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publications; p. 107–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

{{See also|McNeill's law}}

Moreover, another paper argues that the motivation for biological aggression – i.e. using pathogens as weapons – is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/motivation.pdf Rózsa L 2009. The motivation for biological aggression is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire. Medical Hypotheses 72: 217–19.]&lt;/ref&gt; This argument contradicts the widespread belief that biological weapons are rare and aberrant tools of warfare and it is supported by the following observations:
* the use of pathogen weapons predates the scientific understanding of infections and epidemics;
* attempts of biological aggression are easy to hide and to overlook, thus it appears to be underrepresented in written history;
* it is a frequent component of our expectations concerning the likely behaviour of an enemy;
* it is also a frequent component of threats (see e.g. ''white powder letters'');
* several languages appear to bear linguistic references to our motivation for biological aggression in profanity.
* given that wartime epidemics tend to kill people at a rate exceeding (or at least comparable to) that of traditional weapons, all wars fought in recorded history incorporated an implicit element of aggression by biological means.

'''Heraldic visitations''' were tours of inspection undertaken by [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]] (and more often by junior [[Officer of arms|officers of arms (or Heralds)]] as deputies) throughout [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]]. Their purpose was to regulate and register the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] and [[borough]]s, and to record [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an [[upper class]] [[census]]) provide important source material for [[historian]]s and [[genealogy|genealogists]].

==Visitations in England==

===Process of visitations===
[[Image:English heraldic visitations map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Map showing the number of visitations by the [[King of Arms]] to [[England]]'s counties, taken from ''Burke's Landed Gentry'', 1937 edition]]
By the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] was becoming widespread in [[England]]. One of the duties conferred on [[William Bruges]] (or [[Brydges]]), the first [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was to survey and record the [[Coat of arms|armorial bearings]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. [[officer of arms|Officers of arms]] had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.

The first provincial visitations were carried out under [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] granted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to [[Thomas Benolt]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/2/101002134/ www.oxforddnb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; dated 6 April 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry''. (MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London: 1960), 386.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the [[River Trent|Trent]]) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to "put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those [[coat of arms|arms]] unlawfully used".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Vivian, Ed. ''The Visitations of Cornwall, Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573, &amp;1620''. (William Pollard and Co., Exeter: 1887), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of [[knight]], [[esquire]], or [[gentleman]] and decided if they were being lawfully used.

By this [[writ]], Henry VIII also compelled the [[sheriff]]s and [[mayor]]s of each [[county]] or [[city]] visited by the [[officer of arms|officers of arms]] to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a [[King of Arms]], or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a [[coat of arms]]. The [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]] would collect from the [[bailiff]] of each [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] within his county a list of all people using [[title]]s or arms. 

In the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central "place of sitting" – usually an inn – at a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official [[grant of arms]] had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the [[College of Arms]], were confirmed. The [[officer of arms|officer]] would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to [[London]]. 

These volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of "[[parvenu|newly risen]]" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them.&lt;ref&gt;Styles 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Verasano 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, [[Lancaster Herald|Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Siddons|Michael Powell Siddons]]. ''Visitations by the Heralds in Wales''. (The Harleian Society, London: 1996), v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
[[Image:Thomas Hawley Clarenceux King of Arms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hawley]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], wearing a [[tabard]] displaying the [[Royal arms of England]]; the manuscripts from his first tour of London are the earliest existing records of an English visitation.]]
The principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms.&lt;ref name="Wag p167"&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as "originals with signatures".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the "office copies".&lt;ref name="Wag p167"/&gt; Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 24–5, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harleian Collection]] of the [[British Library]] is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the [[Harleian Society]], by county [[Text publication society|record societies]], and a few privately (see [[Heraldic visitation#Published editions|listing below]]). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 18, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as "church notes". These were [[fieldnotes]] (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on [[English church monuments|church monuments]], in [[stained glass]] windows, or on display in private houses.&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.D. |last=Kendrick |authorlink=T. D. Kendrick |title=British Antiquity |year=1950 |location=London |publisher=Methuen |pages=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lankester |first=Philip J. |year=1993 |title=Two lost effigial monuments in Yorkshire and the evidence of church notes |journal=Church Monuments |volume=8 |pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see {{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Ireland |editor2-last=Squibb |editor2-first=G.D. |editor2-link=George Drewry Squibb |title=Dugdale's Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Visitation Papers |place=London |series=Harleian Society, new ser. |volume=6 |year=1987 |ISBN=0-9500207-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lists of visitations===
Visitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux]] and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy]], within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.

====Southern Province====
The Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of [[England]] south of the [[River Trent]], i.e. the counties of [[Bedfordshire|Bedford]], [[Berkshire|Berks]], [[Buckinghamshire|Buckingham]], [[Cambridgeshire|Cambridge]], [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Essex]], [[Gloucestershire|Gloucester]], [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertford]], [[Huntingdonshire|Huntingdon]], [[Kent]], [[Leicestershire|Leicester]], [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Middlesex]], [[Monmouthshire|Monmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[Northamptonshire|Northampton]], [[Oxfordshire|Oxford]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire|Southampton]], [[Suffolk]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Warwickshire|Warwick]], [[Wiltshire|Wilton]], [[Worcestershire|Worcester]], and the [[City of London]]; and [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 66–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Province====
The Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of [[Cheshire|Chester]], [[Cumberland]], [[Derbyshire|Derby]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Northumberland]], [[Nottinghamshire|Nottingham]], [[Staffordshire|Stafford]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Yorkshire|York]]; and [[North Wales]]. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 77–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitations in Ireland==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2016}}
Since the practices of [[Ulster King of Arms]] so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by [[Nicholas Narbon]], the second [[Ulster King of Arms]], in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations ([[Dublin]] in 1568&amp;ndash;1573, [[Drogheda]] and [[Ardee]] in 1570, Dublin in 1572, [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in 1572, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1574, and [[Limerick]] in 1574). One of his successors, [[Daniel Molyneux]] had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of [[Wexford]] – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the [[Dublin]] administration.

Today, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.

A '''historic house''' generally meets several criteria before being listed by an official body as "historic." Generally the building is at least a certain age, depending on the rules for the individual list.  A second factor is that the building be in recognizably the same form as when it became historic.  Third is a requirement that either an event of historical importance happened at the site, or that a person of historical significance was associated with the site, or that the building itself is important for its architecture or interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgiashpo.org/faq_what_makes_a_property_historic |publisher=Georgia Department of Natural Resources |title=What makes a property historic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Houses were first thought of as ''historic'' rather than just ''old'' or ''interesting'', during the early nineteenth century.  Government protection was first given during the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Elizabeth|title=A History of Historic House Reconstruction: Understanding the Past and Informing the Future|journal=Internet Archaeology|year=2011|volume=29|doi=10.11141/ia.29.3|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic homes are often eligible for special grant awards for preservation. What makes a historic home significant is often its architecture or its significance to the culture or history of the area. There are some organizations that offer services to research the history of a home and others that provide repositories for users to document the history of their homes.

Historic homes may still be inhabited, and thus should not be confused with [[historic house museums]].

== Historic houses in the United States ==

The '''''History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence''''' (abbreviated to '''''History of the Great War''''' or '''''British Official History''''') is a series of {{nowrap|109 volumes,}} concerning the war effort of the British state during the [[First World War]].  It was produced by the Historical Section of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] from 1915 to 1949; after 1919 [[Brigadier-General]] [[James Edward Edmonds|Sir James Edmonds]] was Director. Edmonds wrote many of the army volumes and influenced the choice of historians for the navy, air force, medical and veterinary volumes. Work had begun on the series in 1915 and in 1920, the first volumes of ''Naval Operations'' and ''Seaborne Trade'', were published. The first "army" publication, ''Military Operations: France and Belgium 1914'' Part I and a separate map case were published in 1922 and the final volume, ''The Occupation of Constantinople'' was published in 2010.

The ''History of the Great War'' Military Operations volumes were originally intended as a technical history for military staff. Single-volume popular histories of military operations and naval operations written by civilian writers, were to be produced for the general public but Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] was dismissed for slow work on the military volume and his draft was not published. Edmonds preferred to appoint [[half-pay]] and retired officers, who were cheaper than civilian writers and wrote that occasionally the "'War House' foisted elderly officers on him, because they were not going to be promoted or offered employment but was afraid to tell them so".

In the 1987 introduction to ''Operations in Persia 1914–1919'', G. M. Bayliss wrote that the guides issued by [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO) were incomplete. "Sectional List number 60" of 1976 omitted the ''Gallipoli'' volumes but contained ''The Blockade of the Central Empires'' (1937), that had been ''Confidential'' and retained "For Official Use Only" until 1961. The twelve volume ''History of the Ministry of Munitions'', the ''Occupation of the Rhineland'' (1929) and ''Operations in Persia 1914–1919'' (1929) were included. The [[Imperial War Museum]] Department of Printed Books and the Battery Press republished the official history in the 1990s with black and white maps. The Department of Printed Books and the Naval and Military Press republished the set in paperback with colour maps in the 2000s and on [[DVD]]-[[Read-only memory|ROM]] in the 2010s.

==Background==

===Official history===

The modern form of official military history began in the mid-nineteenth century with reports written as guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, were not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that its official histories should be written for the public, since it had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing explicit lessons from their successes and failures.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian could be fraudulent, distorting the record for personal or political reasons. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to their ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas. Military histories written as textbooks might be expected to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students and the British ''Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War'' ([[Walter Kirke|Kirk Report]], 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history and conclusions in the report were incorporated into a new edition of ''Field Service Regulations''. Operations might again be conducted in Iraq and Iran and official history volumes were produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, rarely referring to those of allied and opposing armies; comparative analysis is absent and national bias, due to ulterior motives like the temptation to myth make, can also be found. The Australian ''[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918]]'' edited by [[Charles Bean]] contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagements of soldiers from Britain and its allies.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised. The post-war [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), was at risk of abolition and needed a function that could not be replicated by the army or navy, to justify its existence. The parts of ''The War in the Air'' (1922–1937) written by H. A. Jones gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, unbalancing the work.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}} Embarrassing events can be disguised by underwriting and in the French official history ''Histoire de La Grande Guerre'', the [[French Army Mutinies]] of 1917  were passed over in a few paragraphs in ''Les Armées Françaises dans la Grande Guerre'', despite occurring in {{nowrap|43 percent}} of the French Army. Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the ''History of the Great War'' (1915–1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage of bringing first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art to the work but this risked allowing loyalty and an understandable desire to protect reputations leading to unfair blaming, particularly on outsiders.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=10–11}}

The narrative of the [[Battle of Jutland]] (1916) is described in Volume III of the Royal Navy history ''Naval Operations'' (1923). The draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle, to remove critical remarks about them. Many of the officers were retired or dead, when a revised edition was published in 1940 but the excised passages were not restored.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=10–11}} The British Army ''Military Operations....'' volumes have been criticised for dishonesty, in not blaming GHQ for the extent of British casualties. The authors have been accused of exculpating Field Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from December 1915 to the end of the war, by default. In 2011, Neil Wells wrote that as the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, Haig and other commanders escape explicit blame for failures, yet the reader is left free to form conclusions.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=11–12}}

===British official history===

In 1906, [[Official history|official histories]] were being written by three departments at the [[War Office]] and one in the [[Admiralty]]. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] chairman of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], suggested that a subcommittee be established as the Historical Section, to centralise the collection of army and navy archives, as a repository of the lessons of war for strategists. Esher thought that the lessons of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902) could not be shown unless the naval, military and political aspects of the war were treated as one. In January 1907, the subcommittee was established with Sir [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|George Clarke]] as chairman, charged with the completion of an official history of the Boer War. The original account was begun by Colonel [[George Francis Robert Henderson|G. F. R. Henderson]] (1854–1903), before ill health forced him to retire. Before he died, Henderson had completed a narrative up to the beginning of the war but it was not published. A later version, (''History of the war in South Africa'' 1899–1902, four volumes, 1906–1910) by Major-General [[John Frederick Maurice|J. F. Maurice]] reached publication but had needed a large number of assistants, which increased the price of the book; it was favourably received but did not sell well.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=5–6}}

===Histories of the Great War===
The Historical Section was busy on a history of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) in August 1914 but work was suspended on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as a full-time secretary.{{efn|Daniel retired in 1939, at the age of 74.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}}} Experience of writing the history of the South African War, showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain C. T. Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events like the [[Great Retreat]] of 1914, when few were kept and that these had big gaps. Although the diaries would not show ''why'' events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology and that later they could be scrutinised to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}

A formal decision to write an official history was not taken until a Cabinet meeting on 26 August 1915, when [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] (1 April 1877 – 26 January 1963) the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of the War Council, advocated a series of histories to provide

{{quote|...a popular and authoritative guide for the general reader; for the purposes of professional reference and education [and to provide] an antidote to the usual unofficial histories which besides being generally inaccurate, habitually attribute all naval and military failures to the ineptitude of the Government.|Hankey{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}}}

Field Marshal [[Herbert Kitchener]] (24 June 1850 – 5 June 1916) the [[Secretary of State for War]] wanted work begun on a single-volume popular history, to be published soon after the war. This would maintain public interest in the main series and put the case of the government, at the same time as accounts by participants and popular authors. The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] objected over the cost but Hankey considered that it would be a work of education and reference, not a commercial proposition and that if scientific works were judged only on commercial criteria, research would be abolished.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=6–7}}

The Treasury gave way and agreed to finance an official history series and popular single-volume works, written by civilian authors to ensure public appeal. Sir [[Julian Corbett]] (12 November 1854 – 21 September 1922) was appointed to write the navy volume and Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] (28 December 1859 – 22 October 1933) was chosen for the army volume. Work on the military histories was slow and in 1917, Daniel reported that Atkinson and an assistant had examined only {{nowrap|160 of}} {{nowrap|1,100 unit}} diaries and Fortescue had only reached as far as November 1914. The war precluded a big increase in manpower and for the Fortescue volume to be adequate, Daniel reported that confidential staff correspondence would be needed. With the huge increase in the size of the British army, it would only be practical to use some unit diaries and care would be needed to avoid skewing the selection. In March 1919, [[Winston Churchill]] (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) received a pre-publication copy of the Corbett popular history of the navy and objected to certain passages. Churchill wanted official records to be published with the volume so that the public could judge for themselves. Hankey claimed that Churchill's objections made the publication of an official history series questionable, since they would inevitably reflect on leaders, many of whom remained in public life.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=7–8}}

[[File:Winston Churchill by William Orpen, 1916,.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Winston Churchill by William Orpen, 1916}}]]
Hankey wrote that an official history should ''not'' be written, because it would attract parliamentary and public criticism, the length of time taken to publish would mean that each volume would be examined and that the history would be produced at a loss. The experience of producing the navy volume also showed that each publication would

{{quote|...run the gauntlet of departmental criticism which [was] apt to emasculate the work and deprive it of half its interest.|Hankey{{sfn|Green|2003|p=8}}}}

but the objections were not enough to cancel the project, given the benefits of publication. The public knew little of the early stages of the war and it had a right to benefit from the state monopoly on official information, presented in a readable manner. An official history would also serve to educate professional officers, that mattered more than cost and that criticism was unavoidable. Publication would refute unofficial histories that blamed the government or individual officers and for this, the histories could not evade controversy or be inoffensive to individual sensibilities. The Cabinet agreed for publication to continue, subject to vetting by the War Office and the Cabinet, with the proviso that the decision might be reversed if the Corbett volume was badly received; the volume was published in 1920, to extremely good press reviews.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=8}} Work on the military histories in 1919 was hampered by paucity of resources and bad management, until Brigadier-General [[James Edward Edmonds|J. E. Edmonds]] (25 December 1861 – 2 August 1956), who had joined the Historical Section in February 1919, was appointed Director on 1 April. Edmonds found documents in un-catalogued bundles on the floor, from which historians had abstracted items and not replaced them.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=6–7, 9}}

The Fortescue volume was to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly, that it was decided to end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France.{{efn|Captain G. S. Gordon had been employed in January to cover events to December 1915 and to add the Dardanelles campaign but had disappeared to Gallipoli in June and written nothing.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=9}}}} Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the workings of a contemporary army, apparently being {{nowrap|200 years}} behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language. Fortescue agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was "slurred over in less than one typewritten page". Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lacking interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF, by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue's prevarication and "grossly inaccurate and misleading" writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter "garbled" accounts by the likes of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[John Buchan]]. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds, that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey, that a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate commercial accounts by  civilian authors.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=9–11}}

==Prelude==

===Finance===
The cost of producing the official history was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 13 June 1922, during a proposal to farm out the work to private enterprise. Some [[Member of parliament|MPs]] claimed to have heard nothing of the ''History.... '' despite five volumes having been published to a very good press. Daniel was called before [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the [[Secretary of State for Education|President of the Board of Education]] and pointed out that working on the ''History....'' would never pay a living wage and that for educational reasons the government must foot the bill, because of the exceptional value of the work. He calculated that the cost of the ''History....'' from 1916 to 1922 was about £42,000, the military histories costing £16,800 and the naval works £11,800, while the annual cost of producing [[Hansard]] was £44,000. Daniel also showed that the cost of the war from 3 August 1914 to 31 March 1920 was £11,196,927,000 or £3,500 per minute, a vast cost against which, the price of making the experience available for education was about four minutes of war expenditure per year for the Historical Section. The next meeting of the Historical Section subcommittee on 31 July 1922 endorsed the continuation of the project.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=11–12}}

Finance remained the dominant influence on the production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, [[Air Ministry]] and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the [[Colonial Office|Colonial]] and [[India Office|India]] offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the number of volumes, their scope and size. On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by C. F. Aspinall-Oglander.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=12–13}}

Money determined the speed of publication, the size and number of volumes and the choice of author, Edmonds preferring to employ officers on half-pay or retired on £500 per year, about half the price of a civilian author; officers were usually willing to work longer hours and do unpaid work. The Treasury managed to obtain the removal of Lieutenant-General [[Launcelot Kiggell]], former Chief of the General Staff of the British Armies in France, late 1915 to early 1918, from 1918 Part I for reasons of cost. In 1923, it had been decided to prepare the volume out of sequence, because of the importance of the failure of the German [[Spring Offensive]] (21 March – 18 July) but by 1926, Kiggell had failed to prepare even a draft narrative for circulation to participants and thought that it would take him another four years. At the Committee for Control meeting in January 1926, the Treasury recommended Kiggell's removal and Edmonds agreed, because his work was "lacking in colour and atmosphere".{{sfn|Green|2003|p=14}}

===Commerce===
The price of the early volumes was set at 21 [[Shilling]]s (21s) and another 21s for accompanying map cases but this was considered too costly for professional officers. In 1923, the price was cut to 12s 6d but this left no surplus for advertising and no incentive for booksellers to display them prominently; publishers also set a maximum number of pages per volume, a constraint that led the Committee for Control in 1924 to advise a price increase to 15s. In March 1933, Edmonds showed copies of French, German and Austrian histories to demonstrate their "elaborate and voluminous" nature. The comprehensive nature of the project was also determined by finance and proposals made by government departments from 1922 to 1939, for histories beyond the Western Front. In 1931, the War Office asked for a volume on the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]], because of lessons offered by a campaign in such a climate, at such a distance from Britain. The Treasury refused and suggested that the Colonial Office pay, as it had done for the West African volume. East Africa Part I was eventually published in 1941 with Colonial Office money. At the same meeting, the Foreign Office asked for a volume on the [[Blockade of Germany]] at their expense, because of the lessons that could be learned and its utility in conferences on international law; by being labelled ''Confidential'' it could be written frankly.{{efn|The highest category of confidentiality was ''Secret'', which limited circulation of material to individuals and army officers who had a need to know. ''Confidential'' writing could be seen by commissioned officers and some [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) and ''For Official Use Only'' items could be seen but not bought, communicated to the press or persons not employed by the government.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}}} Several volumes were financed by interested departments but Edmonds retained supervision and maintained the same editorial control as for the other volumes.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=14–15}}

Parsimony affected the organisation of the Historical Section and the speed it could publish the ''History.... '' Premises, visits to battlefields and the number of historians and administrators were limited and in 1922, Edmonds threatened to resign if denied more help. Along with Daniel and Edmonds, the section had only three or four full-time officers, who had to write the volumes, prepare them for publication, maintain the library, study [[prisoner of war]] (POW) records and foreign official and non-official publications (in their native language) and provide help for the War Office, War Graves Commission, Staff College, educational establishments and government departments. The section had about {{nowrap|2,000 visitors}} a year to its cramped offices in [[Cavendish Square]], until it moved to the Audit Office in 1922. By 1924, Edmonds had five administrators and eight writers, when the French and German equivalents had about {{nowrap|130 each;}} the British staff were also underpaid, [[A. F. Becke]] being refused a salary increase from £500 per annum. Edmonds got the money instead, from £560 to £800 per annum and then £1,000 per annum in 1924, when he was writing most of the histories, managing the section and working a seven-day-week for three months, then taking ten days off (Edmonds worked like this for much of the {{nowrap|29 years}} of the project). A 1927 proposal for [[Cyril Falls]] (2 March 1888 – 23 April 1971) to visit Mesopotamia for £200 was vetoed by the Treasury but £50 was allowed for Aspinall-Oglander to visit Gallipoli.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=16}}

===Official documents===

The British had fielded the largest land army in their history, by 1924 the army had generated more than {{nowrap|25 million}} documents and Edmonds thought they would take nine years to sort. When he took up his duties, Edmonds found the papers in heaps in the floor and apparently summarily sacked the Chief Clerk, for refusing to climb a ladder to retrieve a bundle. Edmonds complained that his predecessor, C. T. Atkinson, had let historians plunder the packets of documents and not return items; it had taken until June 1923 to catalogue the records. The first draft of a volume was prepared by a "narrator", who sorted, read and analysed the documents. The result was revised by the "historian" who added comments and a conclusion. The draft was then sent to participants down to battalion commanders, other senior military officers, politicians and government departments. The draft for 1916 Part I (including the [[First Day on the Somme]]) was sent to {{nowrap|1,000 officers,}} who by 1931, had sent {{nowrap|1,470 replies.}} Comments on the first chapter created a pile {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and Edmonds complained that his staff was insufficient, considering that he had briefed them that all names, initials, ranks and numbers had to be checked and then cross-checked with the French and German accounts; the small number of staff slowed production. In 1922, Edmonds had calculated that it would take twenty years to write ten volumes, a feat that the French had achieved in three years. It took {{nowrap|21 years}} (excluding 1939–1945) to produce {{nowrap|14 Western}} Front volumes and {{nowrap|15 more}} on other theatres.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=16–18}}

===Content===
While finance determined the speed of the writing of volumes, Edmonds as Director had the greater influence on the literary and academic integrity of the work.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=18}} In the first volume published in 1922, Edmonds wrote in the preface, that "no deviation from the truth nor misrepresentation will be found in the official histories on which my name appeared". Edmonds' claim has been challenged ever since, leading to a common assumption that the work is vapid at best and at worst fraudulent, a partial, misleading and exculpatory account of the military establishment. In 1934, Liddell Hart questioned the integrity of the writers, calling 1918 Part I "patriotic" and "parochial". Norman Brook, one of the official historians, claimed in 1945, that Edmonds could not be trusted to revise 1916 Part I, because he had succumbed to the temptation to interpolate his views. In 1976, [[John Keegan]] (15 May 1934 – 2 August 2012) wrote

{{quote|...the compilers of the British Official History of the First World War have achieved the remarkable feat of writing an exhaustive account of one of the world's greatest tragedies without any display of emotion at all.|Keegan{{sfn|Green|2003|p=44}}}}

In 1985, David French wrote that Edmonds "...has a private purpose to conceal the truth about the high command in France from the lay public...." and that Edmonds had become concerned to refute claims by politicians, that Haig wasted lives on futile offensives; Edmonds' subjects were heroes beyond criticism. Tim Travers wrote that Edmonds eschewed direct criticism of senior officers, was obliged to Haig and protected his reputation, rigged facts and drew false conclusions in the volumes on the Somme (1916 Part I), Passchendaele (1917 Part II) and 1918 Part I.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=44–45}} In 1996, [[Paddy Griffith]] (4 February 1947 – 25 June 2010), called it an "...encyclopaedic work, transparently individualistic in tone, lucidly organised, wide in scope and by far the best book on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].". Griffith called the quantity of writing on the Great War "prodigious" and that despite Edmonds being unstable, insecure and having never held a [[Field officer|field appointment]], he was conscientious, intelligent and rarely allowed his devious and opinionated nature to distort his work on the official history.{{sfn|Griffith|1996|pp=258–259}}

Edmonds determined the presentation of information, which imposed constraints on the authors. All but implied criticism was to be avoided and the author was to resist the temptation to be "wise after the event". Disclosure of facts about opponents was to be kept to small-type footnotes or notes at the end of chapters, because introducing facts not known at the time was hindsight, which was unfair and un-scholarly. A conclusion could be written for reflection and comment but not for fault- finding. For Edmonds, the constraints were necessary for the facts innocuously to be shown to the lay reader, yet be available to experts reading between the lines.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=54–55}} After Henry FitzMaurice Stacke, the first author of ''Military Operations: East Africa, Volume I'' died and Charles Hordern was appointed as replacement, Hordern wrote that Stacke had been frustrated by being obliged to

{{quote|...gloss over (to put it mildly) mistakes and shortcomings to so great an extent as in my opinion to nullify the value of the work as history. Like him I have sedulously tried to avoid wounding any susceptibilities. But I have not shrunk from criticisms where they seemed necessary for the purpose either of impartial record or military study.... I have striven to say only enough to enable an intelligent reader to form his own judgement.|Charles Hordern (1938){{sfn|Green|2003|p=54}}}}

The avoidance of hindsight was consistent with the education Edmonds received at the [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] on the teaching of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] (1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831), that the critic must only use the information available to a commander and his motives, rather than what the commander did not and could not know. Using knowledge after the event could show arrogance and a lack of critical judgement. In writing the first Gallipoli volume (1929), Cecil Aspinall-Oglander ignored the convention and on the draft copy, Edmonds called his account biased and lacking in the objective judgement necessary for an official historian. When Aspinall-Oglander refused to revise his text, Edmonds criticised him for

{{quote|...lacking critical judgement, of arrogant sarcasm and of producing a valueless work which he would one day come to regret.|Green{{sfn|Green|2003|p=55}}}}

a complaint which had been occasionally levelled at Edmonds by the War Office and several participants in the war. Despite the constraints that Edmonds imposed on the form of the official histories, Green called his accounts accurate and comprehensive. Edmonds's correspondence with [[B. H. Liddell Hart|Basil Liddell Hart]] shows that Hart valued the official history and offered constructive criticism. Green wrote that when David French called the work "official but not history", he had used Hart's words out of context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be read between the lines, Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase "official but not history", to describe the volumes.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=55}}

==Publishing==

===''Persia, 1914–1919''===
[[File:Iran map.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Iran (Persia)}}]]
In October 1920, the [[Government of India]] provided money for a record of the Indian contribution to the world war and chose Brigadier-General F. J. Moberly (15 September 1867 – 6 April 1952) to write the official account of the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] (6 November 1914 – 14 November 1918). Moberly published it in four volumes from 1923–1927 and in 1926 the Government of India requested an additional volume on the [[Persian Campaign]] (December 1914 – 30 October 1918). The work was nearly finished by September 1927, when the Government of India had doubts about publication on political grounds, because it would be dangerous to disclose intrigues with Iranian governments and individuals. The most helpful Iranian factions would come badly out of a volume that denigrated their assistance and "...the less we bring Afghanistan into the narrative the better for us". Sir Denys Bray of the [[Indian Political Department|Foreign and Political Department]] (Army Headquarters, India) supported the "excellent written" history but wanted it lodged in the ''Confidential'' records. Stephen Gaslee of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] wrote to Daniel in October 1927, about his concern that the government of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) might publish information from the [[Russian Empire]] on Iran.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

Gaslee felt that Soviet disclosures might put the British government at a disadvantage, if a censored version of British involvement in Iran had already been published; instead he preferred a comprehensive history kept ''Confidential''. General [[George Macaulay Kirkpatrick|G. M. Kirkpatrick]] (Chief of the General Staff [India] from 1916 to 1920), took the view that discussion of the [[Seistan Force|Seistan Strategy]] might upset Iranian sensibilities. Sir [[Percy Cox]] (20 November 1864 – 20 February 1937) who had been Chief Political Officer of [[Indian Army during World War I|Indian Expeditionary Force D]], told Moberly that it was a fine piece of work, free from bias. Moberly wrote to Cox that avoiding controversy would render the volume valueless, making it impossible to justify British involvement in Iran to the public. Moberly referred to sensitivity over the "corrupt and self-interested attitude" of most Iranian politicians during the war and British fears of unrest in Afghanistan. Cox agreed that a [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]] account would be worthless and that Moberly should write without fear or favour, if necessary securing a commercial publisher. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 9 March 1928, the volume was limited ''For Official Use Only'' and since this would increase the cost of the volume, [[Office of Public Sector Information|His Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO) agreed to pay for it.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

Moberly finished the work in May 1928, then in September, after the Foreign Office and the Government of India had approved the text, [[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]], [[Secretary of State for India]], insisted that the politics of the military operations be removed and the last three chapters re-written, because even in a volume restricted ''For Official Use Only'', the disclosure of secrets was most objectionable. Moberly wrote that if officers were to benefit from the experience of wartime events in Iran, the exceptional nature of political factors there and in neighbouring countries could not be ignored. Moberly wrote that he understood the need for care in writing the history and that the chapters had been vetted informally by the Foreign Office and approved by Cox, who as an expert in the field, was well qualified to balance secrecy with the needs of army students. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 26 March 1929, it was ruled that the volume would be marked ''Confidential'' in Britain and ''Secret'' in India. Edmonds had objected to the ''Confidential'' label, since it would be withheld from young officers but was over-ruled. A limited edition of {{nowrap|500 unexpurgated}} copies was printed by HMSO in late 1929, with {{nowrap|150 being}} marked ''Secret'' and sent to the Government of India. In March 1930, copies of the ''Confidential'' volume were supplied to the [[Imperial War Museum]] (IWM) library among others and in February 1933, HMSO destroyed the last {{nowrap|300 unbound}} copies; in 1987 the IWM published a [[facsimile]] copy of the volume at £24 net.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

===''Rhineland, 1918–1929''===

[[Image:Western Germany 1923 de.png|thumb|{{centre|The occupation zones (Rhineland and [[Occupation of the Ruhr|Ruhr]]) 1919–1930. green ([[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]]): [[League of Nations]] (France), blue: [[France]], brown: [[United Kingdom]], yellow: [[Belgium]], blue/yellow ([[Ruhr]]): France/Belgium}}]]
In 1930, Edmonds proposed a volume on the occupation in the [[Rhine Province]] by [[British Army of the Rhine|British Army on the Rhine]] (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=15}} Edmonds hoped that the War Office would find the money, began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to complain that the official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to [[Lytham St Annes|St. Anne's on Sea]], [[Lancashire]] and thence to the [[National Library of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]] in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. [[Rab Butler|R. A. Butler]], [[President of the Board of Education]], said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the [[Armistice]] and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for the writing of the official histories of the [[Second World War]]. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Edmonds felt qualified to write the volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge of the law of military government working with Professor [[L. F. L. Oppenheim]] (30 March 1858 – 7 October 1919) in 1912 on ''The Laws and Usages of War'' and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at [[Walworth]] in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able to glean plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Charles Fergusson]] (17 January 1865 – 20 February 1951), a former military governor of [[Cologne]], said that he disliked Field Marshal [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|William Robertson]] (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) and that the enmity had led him to resign, despite being on good terms with General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]] (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932).{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Major-General [[Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd]], Chief of Staff of the BAOR, criticised Robertson for being too fussy, Fergusson for pro-German sympathies and told Plumer that Fergusson was too much of a gentleman for the job. Plumer had asked if it were possible to be too much of a gentleman and Massingberd reminisced that he had said

{{quote|...yes you can when fighting against animals like the Boche and the Japs.... You have to fight him as if he was a man eating Tiger or hunting Bull Elephant".|Massingberd{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

Due to the hostilities, Edmonds was unable to correspond and exchange material with German researchers and was allowed only a [[galley proof]] and one page proof. In October 1943, Edmonds complained that speed and economy mattered more than respect for military history. Edmonds hoped that the volume would have educational use, in the event that Britain would again occupy foreign lands and that

{{quote|...the quick change of the German attitude from one of humble subservience to pre-war arrogance, and the call for the strictest economy regardless of the military situation may be said to be the keynotes of the story of the occupation.|Edmonds{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

Edmonds struggled to produce an impartial history of the occupation and draft copies sent to the War Office and Foreign Office, led Brigadier W. L. van Cutsen for the War Office to complain that the volume should have been more broadly written and that administrative and other details were overly detailed but he found the chapter on the operations of the British [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesia]] Force helpful. Far worse criticism came from the Foreign Office on 3 January 1944, the text being called often misleading and incomplete, without the inclusion of much controversial material. It was suggested that the value of the volume would be enhanced by the reduction of political references to mere facts and dates. Examples included a desire to describe the murder of [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (7 April 1882 – 30 June 1934) "in the [[Night of the Long Knives|purge]] of 30 June 1934" rather than "by Hitler" in Edmonds' draft. Unemployment pay should never be referred to as a "dole" as this implied that British men had enlisted in the pre-1914 army to avoid starvation and [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) might resent being portrayed as "less well-disposed" to Germany, than [[Bonar Law]] (16 September 1858 – 30 October 1923). More examples were quoted and ended on Edmonds' description of the [[Locarno Treaties]] (5–16 October 1925) with "...it is most improper for an official historian to describe a treaty concluded by His Majesty's Government as 'verbiage'".{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Edmonds retorted that he would ignore the criticisms as they were "trifling or silly", except for a request to cut a comment that [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Viscount D'Abernon]], Ambassador to Germany (1920–1925) was pro-German. Edmonds pointed out that the views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents and he stood by it. The source of the criticism was [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Webster]] (25 July 1886 – August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, [[Llewellyn Woodward]] (1890–1971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was "dogmatic and prejudiced". Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds' feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds' objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies ''For Official Use Only'' but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Work on the volume had begun in 1930, resumed in September 1942 and was completed in draft in July 1943. Ready to print in May 1944, the order came on 31 July for a limited edition by HMSO, because the small print run made it impossible for [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] to realise a profit. Edmonds later tried to have the small issue made public but in November 1947, HMSO was ordered to destroy the type of the book. (The volume remained unseen, until the Fifty-year Rule was amended to the [[Thirty-year rule]] in 1967, that allowed the public to view the surviving copies.) The failings of the volume raised questions as to the suitability of Edmonds continuing as Director of the Historical Section for the rest of the series but given that it was beyond his normal area of expertise, he was allowed to carry on and produced a short account of the Occupation of Constantinople, saw the remaining volumes on the Western Front through to publication and retired in July 1949, just before the publication of the final volume ''Military Operations: Italy, 1915–1919'' (1949), ended thirty years' work. Edmonds was somewhat chagrined when the War Office ordered 800 copies of ''Assize of Arms'' (1946) by Brigadier-General [[J. H. Morgan]] (20 March 1876 – 8 April 1955), that he called far more outspoken on the occupation.{{efn|Edmonds was also affronted at the publicity for ''The British War Economy'' (1949) by [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Hancock]] and [[Margaret Gowing|Gowing]], compared to the penny-pinching over the ''History of the Great War''.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

===1917 Part II===

====Edmonds====

[[File:Third Ypres - Map Showing Progress in the Ypres Area..jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing advances on the Ypres front, 31 July –10 November 1917.}}]]
In the second volume of ''Military Operations France and Belgium, 1917'' (1917 Part II) Edmonds, wrote that Haig and General [[Hubert Gough]] (12 August 1870 – 18 March 1963) the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] commander (30 October 1916 – 27 March 1918), were at cross purposes before and during the early part of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July – 10 November 1917). Edmonds described meetings between Gough and his corps commanders on {{nowrap|6 and 16 June,}} at which deeper objectives than those of the ''GHQ 1917'' plan was decided and that an extra objective was added, to be attempted at the discretion of divisional commanders. This fourth objective (red line) was beyond the range of most of the Fifth Army field artillery, so all heavy artillery was to be on call to put a defensive barrage beyond advanced posts along it. An advance to the red line was to be attempted only against weak opposition.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=127–128}}

Brigadier-General [[John Humphrey Davidson|J. H. Davidson]], head of the Operations Branch at General Headquarters, questioned the Fifth Army plan in a memorandum of 26 June, recommending that the objectives be less ambitious and that the provision for an advance of {{convert|5000|yd|m}} to the red line be abandoned.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=128, 431–432, App XV}} A Fifth Army order of 27 June, summarised a meeting of Gough and the corps commanders the previous day and laid down the green line as the main objective, that required an advance of {{convert|1000|yd|m}} in the south, {{convert|3500|yd|m}} in the centre and {{convert|2500|yd|m}} in the north, at the junction with the French [[First Army (France)|First Army]] (General [[François Anthoine]]). Patrols were to be sent forward to probe the German defences and occupy vacant ground but it was more important to avoid a ragged front line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=431–432}} In reply to Davidson, Gough wrote that the green line should be attempted and that opportunities to take ground up to the red line "without much opposition", should be taken.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=129, 440–442}}

On 28 June, Haig discussed the Davidson memo at a meeting with Gough and General Plumer (commander of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] on the right of the Fifth Army) and emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=129–130}} Edmonds wrote that the Fifth Army plan did not conform to Haig's requirement that the main battle would be fought for the plateau. Gough had spread the Fifth Army divisions evenly along the front, when he could have increased the size of [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Claud Jacob]]), opposite the plateau. In a footnote, Edmonds described Fifth Army intelligence summaries in July, that stressed the strength of the German defences on the plateau, that the Germans were building more defences there than on the rest of the front and that the assembly areas of the German ''[[Eingreif division]]s'' (specialist counter-attack divisions) were behind the plateau and the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge. The summaries predicted that the Germans would try to hold the plateau, even if driven back across the Steenbeek further north.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|p=130}}

&lt;!--I fear that it is OR from here--&gt;The description of the misunderstanding between Haig and Gough is contradicted by an account on the following pages, of a visit made on 27 June by Haig to the headquarters of II Corps. Jacob asked that his southern flank be extended to allow an attack on the Bassevillebeek Spur (Tower Hamlets) beyond the Bassevillebeek Stream, to deny the German army a jumping-off place, for counter-attacks against the right flank of the corps. Haig emphasised the importance of the capture of the plateau and arranged with the Fifth Army headquarters "at once", for II Corps to take command of the [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]] (Major-General Major-General [[Louis Bols]]) to the south, that was the northernmost division of the Second Army. The Fifth Army–Second Army boundary was moved south on 4 July, to the {{nowrap|Klein Zillebeke–Zandvoorde}} road. In a footnote Edmonds described the transfer of the artillery of the [[23rd Division (United Kingdom)|23rd Division]] (Major-General [[James Melville Babington|J. M. Babington]]), the 24th Division artillery, thirteen medium {{nowrap|(60-pounder gun),}} {{nowrap|25 heavy}} ({{nowrap|fifteen 6-inch gun,}} {{nowrap|five 8-inch}} and {{nowrap|five 9.2-inch howitzer}} batteries from the Second Army to II Corps.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=131–132}}

Edmonds recorded {{nowrap|226 heavy}} and medium guns, {{nowrap|526 heavy}} and medium howitzers, {{nowrap|1,098 field guns}} and {{nowrap|324 field howitzers}}, a total of {{nowrap|2,174 artillery}} pieces in the Fifth Army or {{nowrap|2,299 pieces}} "on the Fifth Army front".{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=135–136}} In footnotes, Edmonds added that II Corps had an "extra division", three heavy counter-battery and three heavy bombardment double groups; (a single group had {{nowrap|4–6 siege,}} heavy or medium batteries) while each of the three British corps to the north had two heavy counter-battery double groups and three heavy bombardment single groups. The II Corps divisions had eight or nine field artillery brigades each, rather than the six in the divisions of the other corps.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=135–136}}{{efn|In ''The [[18th (Eastern) Division|18th Division]] in the Great War'' (1922), G. H. F. Nichols included an anecdote that II Corps had {{nowrap|1,000 guns}} and that each division in II Corps had twelve brigades of field artillery.{{sfn|Nichols|1922|p=204}}}} II Corps had {{nowrap|(43 percent)}} of the Fifth Army artillery and had five divisions, with {{frac|3|1|3}} being engaged on 31 July, compared to four divisions with two engaged, in each of the other corps. The green line for II Corps varied, from a depth of {{convert|1000|yd|m}} on the southern flank at Klein Zillibeke, to {{convert|2500|yd|m}} on the northern flank, along the Ypres–Roulers railway; the green line from the southern flank of XIX Corps to the northern flank of XIV Corps required an advance of {{convert|3500|–|2500|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=153, 433–436, map 10}} An advance of {{convert|5000|yd|m}} to the red line was not fundamental to the plan and discretion to attempt it was left with the divisional commanders, based on the extent of local German resistance, which conformed to the manual SS 135.{{sfn|Corkerry|2001|pp=28–29}} Had the German defence collapsed and the red line been reached, the German {{lang|de|Flandern}} I, II and III lines would have been east of the new front line, except for {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} of {{lang|de|Flandern I}} south of Broodseinde.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=127, maps 10, 12, 15}}{{efn|In the [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)#Capture of Westhoek, 10 August|Capture of Westhoek]] (10 August), II Corps was required to reach the black line of 31 July, an advance of {{convert|400|–|900|yd|m}} and at the [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Battle of Langemarck]] (16–18 August), the Fifth Army was to advance {{convert|1500|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=180, 186, 190, App XVII, maps 17–19}}}}

====Travers====
In ''The Killing Ground....'' (1987), Tim Travers wrote that on the planning and conduct of the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] (31 July – 2 August) and the Battle of  Langemarck described in 1917 Part II, the volume reflected three controversies.{{sfn|Travers|1987|pp=203–209}} Travers wrote that Gough believed that Haig had ordered him to plan a breakthrough offensive, particularly at the meeting on 28 June, yet a few days later, Haig changed his mind and wanted a step-by-step attack. Travers wrote that it was illogical to give the principal command of a bite and hold attack to a "thruster" like Gough, when Plumer had a reputation for thoroughness. Travers wrote that Haig wavered in his thinking about what he wanted but left Gough under the impression that he was to plan a breakthrough attack.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=205}}

Travers wrote that Haig had emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, particularly at the meeting of 28 June and that on 30 June, Haig wrote, "Capture the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge", on his copy of the Fifth Army plan. The importance of the Gheluvelt plateau is also found in GHQ orders of 5 July and Fifth Army orders on 8 July. Travers wrote that the Fifth Army failed to give adequate emphasis to this and that a structural obstacle constrained the army, since the southern edge of the Gheluvelt plateau was inside the Second Army boundary. Travers concluded that Haig and GHQ chose the time, place and strategy of the campaign and that Gough and the Fifth Army staff decided the tactics.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=206}} Travers called Wynne's first draft of 1917 Part II (1943) as "anti-Haig", the second draft (1944) as "anti-Gough" and the third draft (1945) as "anti-Haig and anti-Gough". Edmonds's fourth draft (published 1948) was "pro-Haig and anti-Gough" and Wynne declined to be named as an author. Travers wrote that Edmonds was willing to accept criticism and made amendments for interested parties, to whom drafts were circulated but became increasingly protective of Haig's reputation and noticeably autocratic towards the other historians.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=215}}

Travers described a leadership vacuum in the BEF caused by delegation, that was "scandalous" and that Edmonds failed to stress this. Gough had attempted a breakthrough offensive, conforming to the decisions laid down by Haig, was at fault for overlooking the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau and for ignoring a suggestion by the [[XIV Corps (United Kingdom)|XIV Corps]] commander (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan|Rudolph Cavan]]), to add weight to the attack there.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=216}} Travers wrote that 1917 Part II omitted a request made by Gough in August for a conference, to discuss a remedy for the lack of weight being brought against the Gheluvelt plateau, a matter that Haig and the staff at GHQ should have settled long before the attack commenced, along with the awkward placement of the Second Army-Fifth Army boundary. In the published version of 1917 Part II, most of the blame for the decisions on the type of offensive, the width and direction of attacks and responsibility for planning was put on Gough and the Fifth Army staff, rather than on Haig and GHQ for selecting the Ypres Salient at all.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=217}}

====Green====
In 2003, Green described the writing of 1917 Part II by Wynne and the circulation of the first draft to participants. Gough found the first draft highly objectionable and since so many other participants in the battle had died, his views were given considerable attention by Edmonds, during Wynne's absence on war work in 1943. Gough held that the draft exaggerated his intention to break through the German defences at Ypres. Gough described the meeting of 28 June 1917 by Haig, Gough and Plumer, as evidence of Haig's understanding and acceptance of the Fifth Army plan. Gough noted that General Headquarters had caused a road to be built and kept clear for the use of cavalry and that Haig had rejected Rawlinson's and Plumer's plans as too limited. Gough stressed that his plan was not limited by specific objectives, which had hampered attacks at Loos and Gallipoli in 1915 and the Somme in 1916. Wynne had referred to the Davidson memo of 26 June but Gough pointed out that reserves were available close by, to exploit advantages that emerged, rather than the first attacking troops were to advance indefinitely.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=168–169}}

Green wrote that Edmonds told Wynne to include the points made by Gough but that Wynne objected, because Davidson had related how Haig revised his views after a 25 June meeting with the Cabinet in London and wrote "wear down the enemy but have an objective" on the Fifth Army plan. Wynne claimed that Gough had misunderstood Haig's intentions and that was the source of Gough's objections to the draft; Edmonds supported Wynne but later changed his mind.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=170}} Green wrote that Haig had intended Gough to conduct a breakthrough attempt and that Edmonds had included this in the draft, as well as describing the changes in Haig's outlook during 1917, as the prospect of significant French support varied. Gough had added the red line to meet Haig's requirements but overlooked the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, spreading his forces equally across the attack front. Green noted that Prior and Wilson had found this in their 1998 study and that in 2001 Simpson noted Prior and Wilson's emphasis on artillery and lack of analysis of infantry operations.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=113}} Green also wrote that Edmonds referred to the continuity of Haig's optimism about the possibility of a deep advance on 4 August, 21 September and in early October, long after the likelihood had ended.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=171–175}}

Edmonds changed the draft in Gough's favour, by showing that the weather in August was unusually wet, with extracts from a French study ''Le Climat de La France'' (Bigourdan) that contradicted the 1929 of Haig's Chief Intelligence Officer Brigadier-General [[John Charteris|J. Charteris]] (1915–1918).{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=211–212}}{{sfn|Charteris|1929|pp=272–273}} Edmonds wrote that the worst of the weather was from {{nowrap|12 October − 10 November,}} yet vividly described the wet and muddy conditions in August and their morale-sapping effect on British troops.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=178}} Wynne had written extensively on the difficulties of the French Army after the Nivelle offensive and its effect on British strategy but Edmonds cut much of this.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=182}} Edmonds left much of the remainder of Wynne's draft, despite Gough's objection that it implied that Haig had abrogated his authority, by delegating so much to Gough and not imposing changes, to allay his doubts about the Fifth Army plan for the Gheluvelt plateau.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=177}} Edmonds noted the persistence with which Haig pursued objectives and that he advocated attacks regardless of their geographical progress, to keep pressure on the German army.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=182}}

Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds' willingness to accept Gough's objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, which led to a substantial change in Wynne's point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, who declined to be named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne's conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=183–186}}

Earlier plans had been for short steps and an emphasis on the Gheluvelt plateau. Haig was responsible for accepting Gough's plan for 31 July, despite his cautious reminder to Gough on 6 July, giving the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge and the Belgian coast as geographical objectives. Wynne removed these details from his draft but concluded that the ''GHQ 1917'' plan might have been as successful as the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] (7–14 June). Edmonds had also accepted the logic of an offensive in Flanders but not that of appointing Gough; if Haig had wanted a cautious attack he was wrong to have superseded Plumer. Green showed that Edmonds acknowledged the constraints affecting Haig but that he had wanted a breakthrough attack, chose Gough who known as a "thruster" and encouraged his optimism; Haig had kept any misgivings to himself.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=183–186}}

Green referred to Travers and wrote that he had taken the same view as Edmonds, on the questions of the intended breakthrough and the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds had written that Haig had accepted Gough's wishes and Green wrote that this did not mean that Gough was aware of Haig's doubts. Edmonds thought that Haig wanted a decisive success and the capture of distant objectives on the first day, ''despite'' doubts that he withheld. Travers had written that the Edmonds draft was wrong, yet had formed the same conclusions as Edmonds. Travers had criticised the published draft, for failing to record that Haig had not resolved disagreements and problems among his subordinates, long before the offensive began; Green wrote that Edmonds had made the same criticism. Green wrote that judging the drafts of the volume "pro-" or "anti-" Haig or Gough was facile and led to inconsistent conclusions. If the published draft was "anti-" Gough that it was surprising that he had called it a great improvement.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=186–188}}

Green compared the volume with later studies and wrote that the narrative did not support an explanation of the delay from {{nowrap|7 June – 31 July,}} being caused by a need to divert the Germans from the French army. On 7 May, Haig had decided to begin the Messines operation in early June but he had not been informed until 2 June of the state of the French army. Edmonds had written that the attack on Messines Ridge began on 7 June, because of the difficulty of mounting three simultaneous attacks at Ypres. Edmonds ascribed the apparent delay from {{nowrap|7 June – 31 July,}} to Haig's decision to give principal responsibility to Gough.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=188–189}} Wynne had claimed that Edmonds failed to reveal the superiority of German tactics but in 1998, Prior and Wilson had shown that British tactics had evolved in 1917, although their application was inconsistent. Edmonds had demonstrated that the attack on Messines ridge was a cautious advance for {{convert|1|–|2|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The plan incorporated progressive elements like those used at Arras on 9 April, particularly emphases on counter-battery fire and a carefully controlled creeping barrage.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}}

The Second Army had {{nowrap|2,266 guns}} and howitzers, that fired {{convert|144000|LT|t}} of ammunition, {{frac|2|1|2}} times more than that available for the First Day on the Somme (1 July 1916), to counter the deep German defence zones and ''Eingreif'' divisions.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}} Strongpoints were destroyed, wire was cut and German artillery suppressed. Three layers of creeping barrage {{convert|700|yd|m}} deep preceded the infantry, who had been trained in the pillbox fighting methods used at Vimy Ridge. The infantry were followed by mopping-up parties, who captured by-passed German positions. Use of such techniques had been possible, because the artillery had become more accurate. The gunners also had more ammunition to use and had been able to suppress German defences as the British advanced; objectives had been limited to the range of the artillery and had led to a great victory. Prior and Wilson wrote that these methods were not used on 31 July, because Haig had over-ruled Rawlinson, Plumer and Davidson; Gough over-reached and left the British infantry vulnerable to German counter-attacks. Edmonds had written that on 31 July, excessive demands had been placed on the artillery, that had spread its fire too thin.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}}

Green wrote that at the end of August, Haig had turned to Plumer and bite-and-hold methods, that Edmonds called this a radical revision. The greatest weight of artillery-fire possible was to be massed against the Gheluvelt plateau, for a succession of strictly limited attacks. Plumer planned four steps at six-day intervals, to give time to move artillery and supplies forward. The steps were limited to a depth of {{convert|1500|yd|m}} and a large increase in medium and heavy artillery was to be used to smash pillboxes and to add to the counter-battery effort. The [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] (20–26 September) had double the number of guns on half the depth of attack, making four times the weight of shell compared to 31 July. Infantry tactics also emphasised systematic consolidation of all captured ground and strongpoints. With the new battle drill and unprecedented artillery support, the attack was a great success. Green noted that Prior and Wilson described Menin road as a triumph of reduced expectations and that Passchendaele Ridge was still {{convert|4500|yd|m}} away. Haig had then insisted on preparations for a breakthrough after the successes of the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] (26–27 September) and the [[Battle of Broodseinde]] (4 October) but inadequate artillery preparation led to the failures at the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] (9 October) and the [[First Battle of Passchendaele]] (12 October).{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=191–193}}

Green concluded that the publication of 1917 Part II in 1948 had much to awaken controversy, particularly the contrast between flawed tactics and the methods used with success earlier in 1917. Green wrote that the volume mostly accorded with modern writing and contained little bias regarding Haig. Edmonds had referred to the external constraints of lack of manpower and the state of the French Army, yet his narrative had made the military errors manifest; Haig's desire for a breakthrough had led to a failure to relate strategy to tactics. Haig had failed to communicate with Plumer and Gough and had prolonged the offensive beyond the period of good weather that ended in early October. Green concluded that Edmonds had produced a work of lasting authority, in a series of substantial historical, military and literary value. Green wrote that later scholars who have accused Edmonds of bias, have had to acknowledge that his assessments and conclusions are largely accurate.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=207}}

Gordon commissioned in 1919, wrote three chapters and resigned before he was sacked. In 1923, Lieutenant-General G. Ellison, a staff officer at Gallipoli with confirmed views took over and expanded first volume to nine chapters; criticised inefficiency and bungling, named culprits, including Sir [[Winston Churchill]] the [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911–1915). In 1924, Committee for Control wanted redrafts to remove blame and references to politicians; Ellison refused and was asked to resign. Brigadier-General C. F. Aspinall-Oglander, another staff officer at Gallipoli with similar views took over in 1925, retained much offending material, adding more using forms of words retaining the sense of criticisms, moving passages to different chapters or volumes, satisfying committee but not Edmonds.

'''John Delury''' is an American East Asia scholar, with special interests in the history of China, U.S.-China relations and Korean peninsula affairs.

==Background and education==
Delury trained at [[Yale University]], receiving a B.S. (1997), M.A. (2003) and a PH.D. in 2007, with all degrees in history. He is currently Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at [[Yonsei University]], [[Seoul, Korea]]. He had previously taught at [[Brown University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Peking University]]. He is the associate director of the [[Asia Society]] Center on U.S.-Chinese relations.  He is the co-author, with [[Orville Schell]], of ''Wealth and Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-first Century'' (Random House, 2013).He is a frequent contributor to multiple journals and newspapers, including [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Foreign Policy]], [[Global Asia]], [[38 North]]. and [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gsis.yonsei.ac.kr/main/faculty.asp?mid=n01_04&amp;act=view&amp;idx=121|title=Welcome to Yonsei GSIS|website=gsis.yonsei.ac.kr|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career as a historian took a self-described detour when he visited [[South Korea]] for the first time in 2006 to meet his wife's family.  His area of interest had been limited to [[modern Chinese history]]. After further visits to [[Korea]], he joined the Yonsei faculty in 2010 and made Seoul his home base. His academic interests have since broadenend to include [[Korean peninsula]] studies, [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]]; he has visited North Korea four times.  He feels that his new interest in Korean affairs has broadened his views on [[China]] as well as [[U.S.-China relations]].&lt;ref name=:"2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/korea-and-china/1/steps/25907|title=Portrait of the historian as a young man - Lips and Teeth|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on China==
Delury states that knowledge of China's history is critical; without looking backward to grasp the forces at work for hundreds of years, it is not possible to know China today or its possible future trends. He posits that through China's recent history  there is one constant: "the search for something, anything," that will restore China's greatness (fuqiang 富強, signifying “wealth and power”). China's challenge now is to reconcile its current success to its past sufferings, and relieve their historical sense of inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/wealth-and-power-chinas-long-march-twenty-first-century|title=Wealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-First Century {{!}} YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury.html|title=‘Wealth and Power,’ by Orville Schell and John Delury|last=Kahn|first=Joseph|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delury looks for historical parallels, such as the 1895 [[Gongche Shangshu movement]], the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]], the [[Tiananmen Square protest]] of 1989, and the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 Umbrella Movement]], threads which can be strung together, to chart alternate trajectories for the competing visions of China's future [[chinese political system|political]] and [[Chinese social structure|social order]]; he opines there are no right or wrong tides of history to take comfort in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delury|first=John|date=2014-10-06|title=Out of Tiananmen's Shadow|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2014-10-06/out-tiananmens-shadow|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

While Mao had contempt for [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] customs, in the 1980's the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) began to use traditional themes and prominent [[Classical Chinese|classical]] vocabulary. A prominent example is "[[harmonious society]]" ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 和谐社会; [[pinyin]]: ''héxié shèhuì''), used as a [[socioeconomic]] vision in [[China]] and to deflect the problems of [[social inequality]]. Delury traces the history and usage of the Chinese word "harmonious" and is critical of the CCP, calling this usage "the pseudo-[[Confucianism]] of the CCP."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/harmonious-china|title=“Harmonious” In China|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that [[Xi Jinping|Xi]]'s political program of [[austerity]] is a reflection of a traditional political precept, dating from [[Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delury|first=John|date=2013-08-07|title=Austerity with Chinese Characteristics|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2013-08-07/austerity-chinese-characteristics|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on North Korea==

Traveling in North Korea evoked for Delury the sensation of [[time travel]]; [[Kim Jong-un|Kim]]'s [[charismatic]] [[dictatorship]] and the [[socialist]] [[ethos]] of [[Mao]] on the one side, with the [[grassroots]] [[marketization]] and [[consumer revolution]] of  [[Chinese economic reform|Deng's China]] on the other.&lt;ref name=:"2" /&gt; As with the history of China, it is important to know the [[North Korean history]], and he is critical of American officials who know little about this subject. Without this knowledge it is unlikely for American officials to understand and realistically deal with [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|North Korea's nuclear weapons program]], a highly complex problem with a lot of variation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/790231.html|title=[Interview] Can candlelight energy spark new era of inter-Korean relations?|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It takes years to  understand that history and you can't read in a book even if you had time, you have to meet the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Delury has several significant disagreements with President Trump's North Korea policy. [[President Trump]] has relied on [[China–North Korea relations|China's influence on North Korea]] to exert pressure on the regime to give up its nuclear weapons, using trade with China as an inducement.  Delury notes that since 1958 China has not had any meaningful impact on [[Foreign relations of North Korea|North Korea's foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supchina.com/podcast/china-north-korea-not-close-think-ma-zhao-john-delury-talk-history/|title=Why China and North Korea are not as close as you think: Ma Zhao and John Delury talk history - SupChina|website=supchina.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Delury has described the [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] as futile and counterproductive. He has argued that they are unenforceable and unlikely to stop North Korea's [[nuclear weapons]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/01/opinions/north-korea-sanctions-delury/index.html|title=North Korea sanctions: Futile, counterproductive and dangerous|first=John|last=Delury|publisher=CNN|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a more conciliatory approach, suggesting that the best chance for them to give up its nuclear weapons is by helping [[North Korean economy|North Korean economic]] [[economic development|development]]. He recommends a gradual elimination of the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/opinion/kim-jong-un-moon-economic-development-north-korea-denuclearization.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Kim Jong-un Has a Dream. The U.S. Should Help Him Realize It.|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talk of a [[preventive war]] had become part of the [[mainstream]] debate before the recent thaw in [[U.S.-North Korea relations]]; Delury feels that this should not be an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delury|first=John|date=2017-08-22|title=Take Preventive War With North Korea Off the Table|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2017-08-22/take-preventive-war-north-korea-table|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delury has been described as the [[mass media|media]]'s "go-to expert" on North Korea;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; he warns that [[Media coverage of North Korea|news about North Korea]] tends to be [[sensationalized]], and care should be taken in judging its veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/95ffd16e43af4bca815a22f39813a8ac|title=Experts: US-N.Korea nuclear war unlikely, but risk is rising|work=AP News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/north-korea-reptile-media-kim-jongun|title=North Korea criticises 'reptile media' for saying Kim Jong-un ordered executions|last=Branigan|first=Tania|last2=McCurry|first2=Justin|date=2013-09-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true – but a great deal of it is probably not...the normal standards of [[journalism]] are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'it's North Korea – no one knows what's going on in there.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Latin America==
[[File:MST International Socialist46623.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|Children singing the "[[Internationale]]" at the 20th Anniversary of Brazil's [[Landless Workers Movement]]]]

===Brazil===
[[Getúlio Vargas]], who rose to presidency in [[Brazil]] following the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]], promised a land reform but reneged on his promise.

A first attempt to make a nation-wide reform was set up in the government of [[José Sarney]] (1985–1990) as a result of the strong popular movement that had contributed to the fall of the military government. According to the 1988 [[Constitution of Brazil]], the government is required to "expropriate for the purpose of [[agrarian reform]], rural [[property]] that is not performing its social function" (Article 184). However, the "social function" mentioned there is not well defined, and hence the so-called First Land Reform National Plan never was put into force.

Throughout the 1990s, the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] has led a strong campaign on favor of fulfilling the constitutional requirement to land reform. They also took [[direct action]] by forceful occupation of unused lands. Their campaign has managed to get some advances for the past 10 years, during the [[Fernando Cardoso]] and [[Lula da Silva]] administrations.

It is overseen by the [[National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform]].

===Bolivia===
{{Main|Land reform in Bolivia}}
Land in [[Bolivia]] was unequally distributed – 92% of the cultivable land was held by large estates – until the [[History of Bolivia (1920–64)#The Bolivian national revolution (1952-64)|Bolivian national revolution]] in 1952. Then, the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] government abolished forced [[Peasant|peasantry]] labor and established a program of [[expropriation]] and distribution of the rural property of the traditional landlords to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peasants.  A unique feature of the reform in Bolivia was the organization of peasants into [[syndicates]]. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large supplies of arms. The peasants remained a powerful political force in Bolivia during all subsequent governments.  By 1970, 45% of peasant families had received title to land. Land reform projects continued in the 1970s and 1980s. A 1996 agrarian reform law increased protection for smallholdings and indigenous territories, but also protected absentee landholders who pay taxes from expropriation. Reforms were continued at 2006, with the [[Bolivian senate]] passing a bill authorizing the government redistribution of land among the nation's mostly indigenous poor.

===Chile===
{{main|Chilean land reform}}
[[Chilean land reform|Attempts at land reform]] began under the government of [[Jorge Alessandri]] in 1960, were accelerated during the government of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] (1964–1970), and reached its climax during the 1970-1973 [[presidency of Salvador Allende]]. Farms of more than {{convert|198|acre}} were expropriated. After the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] the process was halted and – up to a point – reversed by the market forces.

===Colombia===
[[Alfonso López Pumarejo]] (1934–1938) passed Law 200 of 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colombiasupport.net/2012/01/the-land-law-bill-forward-and-back/|title=The Land Law Bill: forward and back|last=|first=|date=|website=Colombia Support Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which allowed for the expropriation of private properties, in order to promote "social interest".

Later attempts declined, until the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] presidencies of [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] (1958–1962) and [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] (1966–1970), which respectively created the [[Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INCORA) and further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.

Despite this, the process was then halted and the situation began to reverse itself, as the subsequent violent actions of [[Drug lord|drug lords]], [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and opportunistic large landowners severely contributed to a renewed concentration of land and to the displacement of small landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Matsetela (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, tentative government plans to use the land legally expropriated from [[drug lords]] and/or the properties given back by demobilized paramilitary groups have not caused much practical improvement yet.

===Cuba===
{{main|Land reform in Cuba}}
Land reform was among the chief planks of the revolutionary platform of 1959.  Almost all large holdings were seized by the [[National Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INRA), which dealt with all areas of agricultural policy.  A ceiling of 166 acres (67 hectares) was established, and tenants were given ownership rights, though these rights are constrained by government production quotas and a prohibition of real estate transactions.

===Guatemala===
{{Main|Decree 900}}
Land reform occurred during the "[[Guatemalan Revolution|Ten Years of Spring]]" (1944&amp;ndash;1954) under the governments of [[Juan José Arévalo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz]], after a popular [[revolution]] forced out dictator [[Jorge Ubico]]. The largest part of the reform was the law officially called [[Decree 900]], which redistributed all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than {{convert|673|acre|ha}}. If the estates were between {{convert|672|acre|ha}} and {{convert|224|acre|ha}} in size, uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use.&lt;ref name="Gleijeses 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleijeses|first=Piero|title=The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=21|issue=3|year=1989|pages=453–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law benefited 500,000 people, or one-sixth of the Guatemalan Population. Historians have called this reform as one of the most successful land reforms in history. However, the [[United Fruit Company]] felt threatened by the law and lobbied the United States government, which was a factor in the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|US-backed coup]] that deposed the Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. The majority of the reform was rolled back by the US supported military dictatorship that followed.&lt;ref name="Gleijeses 1991"/&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Main|Land reform in Mexico}}
In 1856, the first land reform was driven by the {{lang|es|[[ley Lerdo]]}} (the Lerdo law), enacted by the liberal government. One of the aims of the reform government was to develop the economy by returning to productive cultivation the underutilized lands of the Church and the municipal communities (Indian commons), which required the distribution of these lands to small owners. This was to be accomplished through the provisions of Ley Lerdo that prohibited ownership of land by the Church and the municipalities. The reform government also financed its war effort by seizing and selling church property and other large estates. After the war, the principles of the Ley Lerdo were perverted by President [[Porfirio Diaz]], which caused land concentration and contributed to causing the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. A certain degree of land reform was introduced, albeit unevenly, as part of the Mexican Revolution.

In 1934, president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] passed the [[1934 Agrarian Code]] and accelerated the pace of land reform. He helped redistribute {{convert|45000000|acre|km2}} of land, {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of which were expropriated from American owned agricultural property. This caused conflict between [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. Agrarian reform had come close to extinction in the early 1930s. The first few years of the Cárdenas' reform were marked by high food prices, falling wages, high inflation, and low agricultural yields.  In 1935 land reform began sweeping across the country in the periphery and core of commercial agriculture. The Cárdenas alliance with peasant groups was awarded by the destruction of the hacienda system.  Cárdenas distributed more land than all his revolutionary predecessors put together, a 400% increase.  The land reform justified itself in terms of productivity; average agricultural production during the three-year period from 1939 to 1941 was higher than it had been at any time since the beginning of the revolution.

Starting with the government of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] (1946–52), land reform steps made in previous governments were rolled back. Alemán's government allowed capitalist entrepreneurs to rent peasant land. This created phenomenon known as [[neolatifundismo]], where land owners build up large-scale private farms on the basis of controlling land which remains [[ejido|ejidal]] but is not sown by the peasants to whom it is assigned.

In 1970, President [[Luis Echeverría]] began his term by declaring land reform dead. In the face of peasant revolt, he was forced to backtrack, and embarked on the biggest land reform program since Cárdenas.  Echeverría legalized take-overs of huge foreign-owned private farms, which were turned into new collective [[ejido]]s.

In 1988, President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] was elected.  In December 1991, he amended Article 27 of the Constitution, making it legal to sell {{lang|es|[[ejido]]}} land and allow peasants to put up their land as collateral for a loan.

[[Francisco Madero]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]] were strongly identified with land reform, as are the present-day (as of 2006) [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]].

Today, most Mexican peasants are landowners.  However, their holdings are usually too small, and farmers must supplement their incomes by working for the remaining landlords, and/or [[traveling]] to the United States.

===Nicaragua===
During and after the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] (1979), the [[Sandinista]] government officially announced their political platform which included  land reform.

The last months of Sandinista rule were criticized for the [[Piñata Plan]], which distributed large tracts of land to prominent Sandinistas. After their [[Sandinista#Opposition (1990 - 2006)|loss in the 1990 elections]], most of the Sandinista leaders held most of the private property and businesses that had been confiscated and nationalized by the FSLN government. This process became known as the {{lang|es|piñata}} and was tolerated by the new Chamorro government.

===Peru===
Land reform in the 1950s largely eliminated a centuries-old system of [[debt bondage|debt peonage]].

Further land reform occurred after the 1968 coup by [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] colonel [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]. The military dictatorship under General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968–75) launched a large-scale agrarian reform movement that attempted to redistribute land, hoping to break Peru's traditionally inequitable pattern of land holding and the hold of traditional oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hunefeldt, C.  A Brief History of Peru.  New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model used by Velasco to bring about change was the associative enterprise, in which former salaried rural workers and independent peasant families would become members of different kinds of cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hunefeldt, C. A Brief History of Peru. New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program outside of Cuba.  Unfortunately, productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control.  The military government continued to spend huge amounts of money to transform Peru's agriculture to socialized ownership and management.  These state expenditures are to blame for the enormous increase in Peru's external debt at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  State bankruptcy was partly caused by the cheap credit the government extended to promote agrarian development, state subsidies, and administrative expenditures to carry out the agrarian reform during this period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   The more radical effects of this reform were reversed by president [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] in the [[History of Peru#1980s|1980s]].

A third land reform occurred as part of a [[counterterrorism]] effort against the [[Shining Path]] during the [[Internal conflict in Peru]] roughly 1988&amp;ndash;1995, led by [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] and the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy]] during the early years of the government of [[Alberto Fujimori]], before the latter's ''auto-coup''.

===Venezuela===
Before 1998, 60 percent of the land in Venezuela was owned by less than 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/874 | title=Venezuela Announces War Against "Latifundios"| date=2005-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2001, [[Hugo Chávez]]'s government enacted [[Plan Zamora]] to redistribute government and unused private land to ''campesinos'' in need. 

The plan met with heavy opposition which lead to a [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt|coup attempt in 2002]]. When [[Pedro Carmona]] took over the presidency during that event, he reversed the land reform. However, the reversal was declared null when the coup failed and Chávez returned to power. By the end of 2003, 60,000 families had received temporary title to a total of 55,000 km² of land under this plan.

Despite the land reforms carried out by the government, which, according to some sources, have reduced the so-called ''latifundios'' (which means "big landownership"), most receivers of the land didn't have any knowledge about how to cultivate the land and grow crops. In many cases, peasants didn't even water, since water infrastructures were still missing in most of the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903400.html | title=In Venezuela, Land 'Rescue' Hopes Unmet| date=2009-06-20| last1=Forero| first1=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in some cases, ''campesitos'' didn't gain direct ownership of the land, but only the right to farm it without having to pay the rent and without sanctions from the government, and in some cases the land wasn't given to single peasant family, but managed in [[communes]], according to the rules of socialism. According to some sources, the expropriated land amounts to 4-5 million [[hectares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/13/this-land-was-your-land-venezuela-land-reform-chavez-maduro/ | title=This Land Was Your Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106620230 | title=In Venezuela, Land Redistribution Program Backfires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above problems, together with a poor treatment of private companies from the government's side and the absence of [[free market]], led to a shortage [[crisis in Venezuela]], which is still ongoing, even though the redistribution of land itself (not carried out through the "communes") can be considered a positive achievement and it didn't probably cause the crisis.{{pov inline|date=November 2018}}

===Paraguay=== 

Land in [[Paraguay]] has been known to be unequally distributed prolonging rural [[poverty]] in Paraguay. Unequal distribution of land was seen more prominent under the 35-year dictatorship of President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in the years of 1954 to 1989. Stroessner was also known to take away many [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]'s land in order to give it to military officials, foreign corporations and civilian supporters. As well as faked an alliance with the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] in order to distribute public land. Campesinos' cries for help for land reform were ignored and the prosecution against them continued, causing them to suffer from high poverty rates. June S. Beittel said that as a result of the unequal distribution of land it left, “ rural areas the most poverty-stricken.”&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44936.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of 1954, the Truth and Justice Committee focused on getting justice for the abuses many Campesinos were facing from their own government. 

Paraguayan [[democracy]] came a long way after its 35-year [[dictatorship]], but the unequal distribution of land is still a problem for the nation since their economy is one that is dependent on its agriculture. A [[census]] in 2008 revealed that “80 percent of agriculture land is held by just 1.6 percent of landowners, with the 600 largest properties occupying 40 percent of the total productive land. More than 300,000 family farmers have no land at all.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Paraguay_background.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguayans have formed unions such as National Federation of Campesinos (FNC) who has fought for justice on the unequal land distributions in [[Latin America]] they have helped many campesinos reclaim acres of land since 1989. The ongoing inequality of land distribution has lead to a demand for land regulation. 

Paraguay has become the fourth world's largest distributors of [[soy]]. Due to this distribution, soy companies are the largest landowners, taking over 80 percent of the land. This production has negatively impacted the lives of rural peasants by leaving them without their own land. Thus, on March 2017, the streets of Paraguay’s capital were filled with more than 1000 campesinos demanding for agrarian reform.  

Thousands of rural [[peasants]] demand access to land, fair agricultural prices for what they produce and technical assistance. Due to the increase in soy production, campesinos has been forced out of their lands leading them to demand land regulations. This demand of the stabilization and fairness of agricultural prices is a result of Paraguay’s government failing to sustain secure prices for their produce which are leaving them to live in extreme poverty. In the effect of no secure economy for their produce, campesinos mandate technical help.

A great majority of Paraguayans continue to practice [[subsistence]] agriculture in the depths of the Paraguayan ''campo'' (countryside). Despite their struggle with poverty, inequality and land rights, Paraguayans are proud of their campesino structure and the traditional culture that arises from it, with this culture being the most prominent in Paraguay than anywhere else in Latin America.

In December 2017, “over one-third of the population was [[impoverished]] and 19% were living in ‘extreme poverty’”, so “the further centralization of land and power has only functioned to exacerbate socio-economic issues.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mario-machado/not-with-a-bang-but-a-soy_b_3851685.html &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the campesino movement is still ongoing due to the desire to continue their campesino traditions and to be able to make a living wage doing so.

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]] (1274 in the Islamic calendar) was the beginning of a systematic land reform programme started during the [[Tanzimat]] period by Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottoman Empire during the latter half of the 19th century, with the overall aims of increasing state revenue generated from land and for the state to be able to have greater control over individual plots of land. This was followed by the 1873 land emancipation act.

===Egypt===
Initially, [[Egyptian land reform]] essentially abolished the political influence of major land owners. However, land reform only resulted in the redistribution of about 15% of Egypt's land under cultivation, and by the early 1980s, the effects of land reform in Egypt drew to a halt as the population of Egypt moved away from agriculture. The Egyptian land reform laws were greatly curtailed under [[Anwar Sadat]] and eventually abolished.

===Iran===
{{main|White Revolution}}
Significant land reform in Iran took place under the [[shah]] as part of the socio-economic reforms of the White Revolution, begun in 1962, and agreed upon through a public referendum. At this time the Iranian economy was not performing well and there was political unrest. Essentially, the land reforms amounted to a huge redistribution of land to rural peasants who previously had no possibility of owning land as they were poorly paid labourers.
The land reforms continued from 1962 until 1971 with three distinct phases of land distribution: private, government-owned and endowed land.  These reforms resulted in the newly created peasant landowners owning six to seven million hectares, around 52-63% of Iran's agricultural land. According to Country-Data, even though there had been a considerable redistribution of land, the amount received by individual peasants was not enough to meet most families' basic needs, "About 75 percent of the peasant owners [however] had less than 7 hectares, an amount generally insufficient for anything but subsistence agriculture.".&lt;ref name="Iran - Rural Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6428.html |title=Iran - Rural Society |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1979 a quarter of prime land was in disputed ownership and half of the productive land was in the hands of 200,000 absentee landlords&lt;ref name="Iran - Rural Society"/&gt; The large land owners were able to retain the best land with the best access to fresh water and irrigation facilities. In contrast, not only were the new peasant land holdings too small to produce an income but the peasants also lacked both quality irrigation system and sustained government support to enable them to develop their land to make a reasonable living. Set against the economic boom from oil revenue it became apparent that the Land Reforms did not make life better for the rural population: according to Amid, "..only a small group of rural people experienced increasing improvements in their welfare and poverty remained the lot of the majority".&lt;ref&gt;Amid, M. (1990) 'Agriculture, Poverty and Reform in Iran' London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;
Moghadam argues{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} that the structural changes to Iran, including the land reforms, initiated by the White Revolution, contributed to the revolution in 1979 which overthrew the Shah and turned Iran into an Islamic republic.

===Iraq===
Under British Mandate, Iraq's land was moved from communal land owned by the tribe to tribal sheikhs that agreed to work with the British.  Known as compradors, these families controlled much of Iraq's arable land until the end of British rule in 1958.  Throughout the 1920s and 30s, more and more land began to be centered in the hands of just a couple families.  By 1958 eight individual families owned almost 1 million acres.  
However, the British did attempt to instill some reforms to increase the productivity of the land in Iraq.  In 1926 the Pump Law was introduced, essentially legislating that all newly irrigated land would be tax free for 4 years.  This led to some short term gains in land productivity.  If land was cultivated for 15 years, it then became the property of the person who cultivated that land.  From 1914 to 1943 there was an increase from 1 million to 4.25 million acres of land developed.  Unfortunately, irrigation of the land was irresponsible, and many farmers didn't allow for drainage, which led to a buildup of salt and minerals in the land, killing its productivity.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Iraq by Charles Tripp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the rise of the Communist Party led to the seizing of much of the land by the Iraqi government.  Landholdings were capped at 600 acres in arable areas and 1200 acres in areas that had rainfall.  The concentrated landholdings by the state were then redistributed among the populace, in amounts of 20 acres in irrigated land, with 40 acres in land with rainfall.

In 1970, the [[Ba'th Party]], led by [[Saddam Hussein]] began instituting a wide series of sweeping land reforms.  The intent of the reforms was to remove control of land owned by the traditional rural elites and redistribute it to peasant families.  Modeled after the 1958 land reforms, much of the state land was rented out, though often to people who originally owned the large swathes of land.  The key to this new reform was the [[Agrarian Reform Law of 1970.]]Between 1970 and 1982, 264,400 farmers received grants of land.  However, these reforms did not contribute to an improvement in the production of agricultural goods, leading the regime to increase its imports of food products.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Modern Middle East, William &gt; Cleveland and Martin Bunton&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maghreb===
As elsewhere in North Africa, lands formerly held by European farmers have been taken over. The nationalisation of agricultural land in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] led to the departure of the majority of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994). ''"[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8VHizsqaH0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Migration and development co-operation.]"''. Council of Europe. p.25. {{ISBN|92-871-2611-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
Land reforms were first implemented in Syria during 1958. The Agricultural Relations Law laid down a redistribution of rights in landownership, tenancy and management.

The reforms were halted in 1961 due to a culmination of factors, including opposition from large landowners and severe crop failure during a drought between 1958 and 1961, whilst Syria was a member of the doomed United Arab Republic (UAR).

After the [[Ba'ath Party]] gained power in 1963 the reforms were resumed. The reforms were portrayed by the governing Ba'ath as politically motivated to benefit the rural property-less communities. According to [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], a co-founder of the Ba'ath Party, the reforms would "liberate 75 percent of the Syrian population and prepare them to be citizens qualified to participate in the building of the state".&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Heydemann 1999 p.193 'Authoritarianism in Syria: Institutions and Social Conflict' 1946-1970 Cornell University Press Ithica&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the land reform represented work by the 'socialist government', however, by 1984 the private sector controlled 74 percent of Syria's arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/43.htm |title=Syria - Agriculture |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This questions both Ba'ath claims of commitment to the redistribution of land to the majority of peasants as well as the state government being socialist (if it allowed the majority of land to be owned in the private sector how could it truly be socialist?). Hinnebusch argued that the reforms were a way of galvanising support from the large rural population: "they [Ba'ath Party members] used the implementation of agrarian reform to win over and organise peasants and curb traditional power in the countryside".&lt;ref&gt;Hinnebusch, R. 2001 p.55 'Syria Revolution From Above' Routledge New York&lt;/ref&gt;  To this extent the reforms succeeded and resulted with an increase in Ba'ath party membership. They also prevented political threat emerging from rural areas by bringing the rural population into the system as supporters.

===Albania===
{{Main|Land reform in Albania}}
[[Albania]] has gone through three waves of land reform since the end of World War II: in 1946, the land in estates and large farms was expropriated by the communist government and redistributed among small peasants; in the 1950s, the land was reorganized into large-scale collective farms; and after 1991, the land was again redistributed among private smallholders.

===Estonia===
{{Main|Estonian Land Reform Act 1919|Estonian Land Reform Act 1991}}

[[Estonia]] has witnessed two periods of land reform in 1919 and 1991 which occurred very shortly after the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declaration of Estonian independence]] and the [[Estonian restoration of Independence|restoration of independence]] respectfully. The act of 1919 was primarily concerned with the transferral of land ownership from [[Baltic German]]s to ethnic [[Estonians]]. The 1991 act was instead aimed at the transfer of land ownership from the state (having been nationalised under [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]]) to private individuals based on historic land ownership in 1940 as well as the protection of the legal rights of the present users of land.

===Finland===
In the general reparcelling out of land, begun in 1757 when Finland was a part of Sweden, the medieval model of all fields consisting of numerous strips, each belonging to a farm, was replaced by a model of fields and forest areas each belonging to a single farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www02.oph.fi/etalukio/historia/autonomia/isojako.html Isojako]. Etälukio. Finnish Board of Education. Retrieved 2016-03-15. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the further reparcellings, which started in 1848 when Finland was part of Russia, the idea of concentrating all the land in a farm to a single piece of real estate was reinforced. In these reparcelling processes, the land is redistributed in direct proportion to earlier prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/kansatiede/histmaatalous/maanjaot/uusjako.htm Uusjako hajotti ryhmäkylät]. University of Helsinki.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Irish Land Acts}}
At the 19th century, most of the land in Ireland belonged to [[Absentee landlord|large landowners]], most of them of English origin. Most of the Irish population were tenants, having few rights and forced to pay [[Rack rent|high rents]]. This situation was a contributory factor to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] of 1845-1852 and the main cause of the [[Land War]]'s of 1870s-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.failteromhat.com/book/godkin-landwarinireland.htm|title=The Land War in Ireland - A History for the Times.|publisher=|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] responded to the agitations in Ireland with a series of [[Irish Land Acts|land acts]], beginning with the First Irish Land Act 1870 (initiated by prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]), followed by further five land acts overseen by a Land Commission, prior to independence in 1922, by which time over 90% of lands had transferred from landlords to their former tenant farmers on negotiated terms with funding provided by the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/land-purchase-acts-1903-and-1909 Land Purchase Acts 1903+1909 encyclopedic definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
Land reform has been a long-standing and widespread problem before the XX century, especially in [[South Italy]]. Despite the vain attempts of the governments to redistribute the land  in South Italy (the so-called ''Mezzogiorno''), from the pragmatic decree '' De administratione Universitatum '' (1792) of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]] to the law ''Leggi eversive delle feudalità'' (which literally means "laws abolishing feudalism") in 1806-1808, enacted by [[Joseph Bonaparte]], the issue remained largely unsolved, mainly because of the strenuous opposition of the great landowners, unwilling to lose their privileges and to allow the emancipation of the peasant class. Even with the [[Unification of Italy]], despite the promises of the abolition of the so-called ''latifondi'' ("large estates"), the problem remained unsolved. South Italy's big landowners, which had been loyal to the [[Bourbons]] until the 1860, actively contributed to the unificiation of Italy in order to not lose its prestige, and expropriating estates from them would have implied, for the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)]], to have a powerful enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brigantaggio.net/brigantaggio/Storia/Meridionale/Qsecond.htm|author=[[Tommaso Pedio]]|title=Latifondo e usi civici, prammatica 1792, eversione della feudalità, usurpazioni delle terre demaniali, adesione dei galantuomini al nuovo regime|access-date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Italy's peasants, disappointed and irritated, rebelled and provoked a bloody civil war, known as [[Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861|Post-Unification Brigandage]].

The first effective land reform was carried out in 1950, right after the birth of the [[Italian Republic]]. [[Italian Parliament]] passed the decree ''legge stralcio n. 841 del 21 ottobre 1950'', which provided the legal basis for land expropriation and redistribution. The redistribution occurred over a longer period of time, about 10-20 years.

The decree, financed in part with the funds of [[Marshall Plan]], launched by the [[United States]] in 1947, but also opposed by conservative members of the American administration&lt;ref&gt;Sulla complessa vicenda dell'apporto americano, Emanuele Bernardi, "La riforma agraria in Italia e gli Stati Uniti", Bologna, il Mulino, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably was, according to some scholars, the most important reform of the [[aftermath of World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;Corrado Barberis ''Teoria e storia della riforma agraria'' Firenze, Vallecchi, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;. The decree provided that the land had to be distributed to peasants through [[compulsory purchase]], thus turning them into [[Small business|small entrepreneurs]] no longer subjected to large landowners. On one side, the reform had a positive outcome to the population, but, on the other side, it also considerably reduced Italian farms size, reducing the chances for bigger companies to grow. However, this drawback was attenuated and, in some cases, eliminated by implementing forms of cooperation. [[Agricultural cooperatives]] started to spread, and, since then, agriculture turned into an entrepreneurial business which could expand, plan its production and centralize the sale of products.

After the land reform of 1950, large estates (''latifondi'') by law cannot be bigger than 300 [[hectares]] (3 [[km²]])&lt;ref&gt;Fonte: Pag 108 del libro ''Studi sul Mezzogiorno repubblicano: storia politica ed analisi'', Di Luca Bussotti, Rubbettino Editore srl, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;. Before the 1950, large estates were widespread, especially in South Italy. Nowadays large estate aren't present anymore on Italy's territory.

For example, in [[Sicily]] before the 1950, large estates larger than 500 [[hectares]] (5 [[km²]]) were 228.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/italian/gadda/Pages/resources/essays/borghisici.php&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, 20.6 percent of the island's land was owned by only 282 big landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxismo.net/content/view/1932/92/ | title=L'Indipendenza della Catalogna e i compiti della sinistra spagnola}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the region [[Abruzzo]], large estates were also widespread. The most notable case is perhaps the estate of the [[Torlonia family]], which owned large estates near [[Fucino|Piana del Fucino]]; its size was more than 14,000 [[hectares]] (140 [[km²]]), and it was redistributed to 5,000 Italian families of landless farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte: Pag 195 di "La Geografia. Per la scuola Media, Volume n°1; G. Bacchi, A. Londrrillo; [[Editore Bulgarini Firenze|Editore Bulgarini]]; [[Firenze]] [[1983]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crop yield]] significantly increased after 1950, since agriculture had become intensive. Following the development of [[industry]], [[agriculture]] has now become a marginal sector of [[Italian economy]], but, by implementing  modern [[Agriculture|agricultural techniques]], its profitability per [[hectare]] increased.

===Russia and the Soviet Union===

The [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], effected during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia]], abolished [[serfdom]] throughout Russia. More than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs were granted the full rights of free citizens, gaining the rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within peasant communities called [[Mir (commune)|mir]]s, which acted as village governments and cooperatives. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household.   This communal system was abolished in 1906 by the capitalist-oriented [[Stolypin reform]]s. The reforms introduced the unconditional right of individual landownership. They encouraged peasants to buy their share of the community lands, leave the communities and settle in privately owned settlements called [[Khutor]]s. By 1910 the share of private settlements among all rural households in the European part of Russia was estimated at 10.5%.

The Stolypin reforms and the majority of their benefits were reversed after the [[October Revolution|communist revolution of 1917]]. The [[Decree on Land]], issued by Lenin at 1917, and the "Fundamental Law of Land Socialization" of 1918, decreed that private ownership of land is totally abolished - land may not be sold, purchased, leased, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated. All land, whether state, crown, monastery, church, factory, entailed, private, public, peasant, etc., shall be confiscated without compensation and become the property of the whole people, and pass into the use of all those who cultivate it. These decrees were superseded by the [[1922 Land Code]].   After the universal agricultural collectivization, land codes of the Soviet republics lost their significance. See [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union]].

After the collapse of the USSR, a new land code was enacted, allowing private land ownership. See [[Agriculture in Russia]].

===Sweden===
{{see also|Great Partition (Sweden)}}
In 1757, the general reparcelling out of land began. In this process, the medieval principle of dividing all the fields in a village into strips, each belonging to a farm, was changed into a principle of each farm consisting of a few relatively large areas of land. The land was redistributed in proportion to earlier possession of land, while uninhabited forests far from villages were socialized (see [[Agriculture in Sweden#History]]).

In the 20th century, Sweden, almost non-violently, arrived at regulating the length minimum of [[tenant farming]] contracts at 25 years.

===United Kingdom===
There have been many land reformers in the [[United Kingdom]], but most actual land reform has taken place in [[Scotland]] rather than [[England and Wales]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Advocates of land reform in Britain have included the 17th-century [[Diggers]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], and [[Jesse Collings]]. Currently the Labour Land Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Land Campaign|url=http://www.labourland.org/|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the case for a [[land value tax]], one of the results of which would be some land reform.

In the 21st century, [[land reform in Scotland]] has focused on the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|abolition and modernisation of Scotland's antiquated feudal land tenure system]], security of tenure for [[Crofting|crofters]] and decentralisation of Scotland's highly concentrated private land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot|first1=Alison|last2=Watt|first2=John|last3=Ian|first3=Cooke|last4=Taylor|first4=Pip|title=The Land of Scotland and the Common Good: Report of the Land Reform Review Group|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0045/00451087.pdf|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=4 March 2017|language=English|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's land reform is distinct from other contemporary land reforms in its focus on [[Community ownership|community land ownership]]&lt;ref name=bg07&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2005.09.004|title=Community-based land reform: Lessons from Scotland|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=24|pages=24–34|year=2007|last1=Bryden|first1=John|last2=Geisler|first2=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

===Ethiopia===
{{Main|Land reform in Ethiopia}}
Historically, Ethiopia was divided into the northern highlands, which constituted the core of the old Christian kingdom, and the southern highlands, most of which were brought under imperial rule by conquest.   In the northern regions, the major form of ownership was a type of communal system known as ''rist''. According to this system, all descendants of an individual founder were entitled to a share, and individuals had the right to use a plot of family land. Rist was hereditary, inalienable, and inviolable. No user of any piece of land could sell his or her share outside the family or mortgage or bequeath his or her share as a gift, as the land belonged not to the individual but to the descent group. Most peasants in the northern highlands held at least some rist land. Absentee landlordism was rare, and landless tenants were estimated at only about 20% of holdings.    On the contrary, in the southern provinces, few farmers owned the land on which they worked. After the conquest, officials divided southern land equally among the state, the church, and the indigenous population. Tenancy in the southern provinces ranged between 65% and 80% of the holdings, and tenant payments to landowners averaged as high as 50% of the produce.   In the easternlowland periphery and the Great Rift Valley, most land were used for grazing. The pastoral social structure is based on a kinship system with strong interclan connections; grazing and water rights are regulated by custom.

Beginning in the 1950s, the government tried to modernize the agriculture by granting large tracts of traditional grazing lands to large corporations and converting them into large-scale commercial farms. In the north and south, peasant farmers lacked the means to improve production because of the fragmentation of holdings, a lack of credit, and the absence of modern facilities. Particularly in the south, the insecurity of tenure and high rents killed the peasants' incentive to improve production. Further, those attempts by the Imperial government to improve the peasant's title to their land were often met with suspicion. By the mid-1960s, many sectors of Ethiopian society favored land reform. University students led the land reform movement and campaigned against the government's reluctance to introduce land reform programs and the lack of commitment to integrated rural development.

In 1974, The socialist [[Derg]] government rose to power, and on March 4, 1975, the Derg announced its land reform program. The government nationalized rural land without compensation, abolished tenancy, forbade the hiring of wage labor on private farms, ordered all commercial farms to remain under state control, and granted each peasant family so-called "possessing rights" to a plot of land not to exceed ten hectares. The Ethiopian Church lost all its land. Although the Derg gained little respect during its rule, this reform resulted in a rare show of support for the junta.

Tenant farmers in southern Ethiopia welcomed the land reform, but in the northern highlands many people resisted land reform and perceived it as an attack on their rights to rist land. The lowland peripheries were only slightly affected by the reforms.

The land reform destroyed the feudal order. It changed landowning patterns – particularly in the south – in favor of peasants and small landowners. It also provided the opportunity for peasants to participate in local matters by permitting them to form associations.

===Kenya===
In the 1960s, president [[Jomo Kenyatta]] launched a peaceful land reform program based on "willing buyer-willing seller". It was funded by [[Great Britain]], the former colonial power.

In 2006, president [[Mwai Kibaki]] said it will repossess all land owned by "absentee landlords" in the coastal strip and redistribute it to squatters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph |first=Odhiambo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/5275670.stm |title=Pledge to redistribute Kenya land |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===
{{Main|History of Namibia#Land reform}}
Namibia's colonial past had resulted in a situation where about 20% of the population (mostly white settlers) owned about 75 percent of all the land.
&lt;ref name="Situation Report"&gt;{{cite web

In 1990, shortly after Namibia got its independence, its first president [[Sam Nujoma]] initiated a plan for land reform, in which land would be redistributed from whites to blacks. legislation passed in September 1994, with a compulsory, compensated approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200608170017.html Namibia: Land Reform to Cost Billions]&lt;/ref&gt;
The land reform has been slow, mainly because Namibia's constitution only allows land to be bought from farmers willing to sell. Also, the price of land is very high in Namibia, which further complicates the matter.

By 2007, some 12% of the total commercial farmland in the country was taken away from white farmers and given to black citizens.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Land Reform in South Africa}}
The [[Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 "prohibited the establishment of new farming operations, sharecropping or cash rentals by blacks outside of the reserves"&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"&gt;Deininger, Klaus. "Making Negotiated Land Reform Work: Initial Experience from Colombia, Brazil and South Africa." World Development Vol. 27(1999): 651-672&lt;/ref&gt; where they were forced to live.

In 1991, after a long anti-apartheid struggle led by the [[African National Congress]], State President [[F. W. de Klerk]] declared the repeal of several apartheid rules, particularly: the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas and the Natives' Land Act. A catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise history of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.

In 1994, shortly after the African National Congress came to power in South Africa, it initiated a land reform process focused on three areas: restitution, land tenure reform and land redistribution.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. and B. McCusker. 2008. "Fighting Fire with a Broken Tea Cup: A Comparative Analysis of South Africa's Land Redistribution Program." Geographical Review. 98(3): 322-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Restitution, where the government compensates (monetary) individuals who had been forcefully removed, has been very unsuccessful and the policy has now shifted to redistribution.

Initially, land was bought from its owners (willing seller) by the government (willing buyer) and redistributed, in order to maintain public confidence in the land market.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"/&gt;
This system has proved to be very difficult to implement, because many owners do not actually see the land they are purchasing and are not involved in the important decisions made at the beginning of the purchase and negotiation.

In 2000 the South African Government decided to review and change the redistribution and tenure process to a more decentralized and area based planning process. The idea is to have local integrated development plans in 47 districts.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Ruth. "Decentralisation in South Africa's Land Redistribution."

===Zimbabwe===
{{Main|Land reform in Zimbabwe}}
By 1979, when [[Zimbabwe]] gained independence, 46.5% of the country's arable land was owned by around 6,000 commercial farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chigara|first=Ben|year=2002|title=Land Reform Policy|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=52|isbn=978-0-7546-2293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and white farmers, who made up less than 1% of the population, owned 70% of the best farming land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/692638.stm |title=Britain's troubles with Mugabe|publisher=BBC News  | date=3 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, president [[Robert Mugabe]] initiated a "willing buyer, willing seller" plan, in which white land-owners were encouraged to sell their lands to the government, with partial funding from Britain.&lt;ref name="WILLING"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN081477542X&amp;id=ElOl_a0Rb9AC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=LHJcWuepy9&amp;dq=Mugabe+%22willing+buyer,+willing+seller%22&amp;sig=CO_KQT9eoFfdN470PDQUvtZgglg#PPA302,M1 Page 302] ''Big Men, Little People: The Leaders Who Defined Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; Around 71,000 families (perhaps 500,000 people) settled on 3.5 million hectares of former white-owned land under this programme, which was described by "The Economist" in 1989 as "perhaps the most successful aid programme in Africa".&lt;ref&gt;All Party Parliamentary Group Report Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 Land Acquisition Act was enacted to speed up the land reform process by removing the "willing seller, willing buyer" clause, limiting the size of farms and introducing a land tax (although the tax was never implemented.)&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/land/gp_zimbabwe.html |title=Online NewsHour – Land Redistribution in Southern Africa: Zimbabwe Program |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act empowered the government to buy land compulsorily for redistribution, and a fair compensation was to be paid for land acquired. Landowners could challenge in court the price set by the acquiring authority. Opposition by landowners increased throughout the period of 1992 to 1997. In the 1990s, less than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were acquired, and fewer than 20,000 families were resettled. Much of the land acquired during what has become known as "phase one" of land reform was of poor quality, according to Human Rights Watch. Only 19 percent of the almost 3.5 million hectares (8.65 million acres) of resettled land was considered prime, or farmable.

In 1997, the new British government, led by [[Tony Blair]], unilaterally stopped funding the "willing buyer, willing seller" land reform programme. Britain's ruling Labour Party felt no obligation to continue paying white farmers compensation.

In 2000, [[Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2000|a referendum on constitution]]al amendments was held. The proposed amendments called for a "fast track" land reform and allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land for redistribution to black farmers without compensation. The motion failed with 55% of participants against the referendum.&lt;ref name="CONSTREF"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0749440651&amp;id=IEfzrFNicNkC&amp;pg=RA7-PA372&amp;lpg=RA7-PA372&amp;ots=hxNyGgpjJJ&amp;dq=Mugabe+Constitution+2000+February+12&amp;sig=01pjadymQ5N5OHGmuXfPG1ETsFI#PRA7-PA372,M1 Page 372] ''Africa Review 2003/2004''&lt;/ref&gt; However, self-styled "war veterans", led by [[Chenjerai Hunzvi]], began invading white-owned farms.

Parliament, dominated by [[Zanu-PF]], passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the "Fast Track" process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government's decision to expropriate their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051112040534/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-12-voa36.cfm?CFID=53041476&amp;CFTOKEN=35798529 |title=voanews.com |date=2005-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe]] ruled against legal challenges to this amendment.&lt;ref name="zimsupct"&gt;Mike Campbell (Private) Limited v.

During the "fast track", many parcels of land came under the control of people close to the government, as is the case throughout Africa.  The several forms of forcible change in management caused a severe drop in production and other economic disruptions.

===Canada===
{{Main|Land Purchase Act (1875)}}
A land reform was carried out as part of [[Prince Edward Island]]'s agreement to join the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1873. Most of the land was owned by [[absentee landlords]] in England, and as part of the deal Canada was to buy all the land and give it to the farmers.

===United States===

Following the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], many blacks and military officials considered land reform vital. The downfall of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] emancipated millions, but few former slaves had the means to exercise real autonomy. Land, even at depressed post-war prices, was difficult for African Americans to procure.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, with southern wealth the result of centuries of forced labor, blacks nationwide called for property on the basis of just [[reparations for slavery|reparations]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, redistribution carried the support of [[Radical Republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brinkley, ''The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People'', 6th ed, McGraw-Hill, 2010, p.372-374&lt;/ref&gt; But opposing any grants to blacks were [[southern Democrats]], along with a White House committed to 'restoration'.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayborne Carson]], Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and [[Gary B. Nash]], ''The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans'', Combined vol., 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 2011, p. 265-266,276-277&lt;/ref&gt; Given national divisions, reform efforts were varied but short-lived.

Many [[African Americans]] believed property was critical to erasing slave-oriented social order.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to speaking out, some demanded plots and moved into their master’s plantation homes by force.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p.104-105&lt;/ref&gt; Others bought land collectively, or squatted on what was undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 105-106, 403&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout war and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the presence of [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] troops provided a platform for agricultural policy. In 1865, [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] issued [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15|Field Order 15]], taking coastal land in [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]], and dividing it into 40-acre plots for black settlement, hence the term "[[40 acres and a mule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/sfo15.htm|title=Order by the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi|accessdate=2012-12-31|publisher=Freedmen and Southern Society Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Congress established the [[Freedmen’s Bureau]], whose commissioner had authority to redistribute confiscated or abandoned southern land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2282&amp;chapter=216250&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|title=Freedmen's Bureau Bill|chapter=An Act to Establish a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen and Refugees|accessdate=November 2, 2018|publisher=[[The Online Library of Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau held {{convert|850,000|acre|km2}}, and key directors pushed for its settling with former slaves. When President [[Andrew Johnson]] began to pardon Confederates and restore their property, [[Commissioner]] [[Oliver O. Howard]] issued Circular 13. The order instructed agents to establish 40-acre parcels with haste. Johnson rescinded the order, and an overwhelming majority of Bureau land returned to its previous owners.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The final reform attempts of Reconstruction occurred within state governments. In South Carolina, a land commission was established, which purchased property and sold it on long-term credit.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Other state Republicans utilized new tax systems, penalizing large estates, to seize and divide land and stimulate black ownership. This indirect method achieved little, as taxes were repaid and lands were reclaimed. Of property not redeemed, much was exploited by investors.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 375-377&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Reconstruction was discounted as 'Socialism' by moderates committed to free-market transformation, a popular new line of political attack&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 524–525&lt;/ref&gt; levied against the likes of [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]] and [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;Republicans of the era firmly believed in free-labor ideology, considering the laws of contract vital to society. Reconstruction policy was predominantly geared to establishing a workforce employed conditionally, and paid for its work. Foner, 1988, pp. 164-169, 379-380&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals began to fall even earlier, with the failure of [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson’s impeachment]]. [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], eroding the era's political landscape, called for an immediate end to “black barbarism”.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Pike, reporting on the south, indicating the growing appeal of racist rhetoric in anti-Reconstruction politics. Foner, 1988, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 524-531&lt;/ref&gt; White supremacist violence and [[Panic of 1873|financial panic]]&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; weakened Reconstruction to the breaking point. With the [[Compromise of 1877]], it was finished.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 602-612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes owned about 138 million acres (560,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land in the USA. Land was considered the property of the whole tribe, which used it to cater to the needs of the individual tribe members. This approach to land ownership was different than the white European approach, which regarded land as private property of individuals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Many US politicians{{Who|date=July 2014}} believed it was important to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture, and thus have their lands open for commerce and development. The [[Dawes Act]] (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act), adopted by Congress in 1887, authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians. Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The Dawes Act was amended in 1891, and again in 1906 by the [[Burke Act]].

Through the Dawes Act, many Indians received private title to a land-plot, but most of the Indian lands were considered "surplus", and put to sale to white European settlers. Thus, the total amount of land owned by Indians decreased to only 48 million acres (190,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1934.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Most tribal land still owned by ethnic Indians was recollectivized in 1934.

===Afghanistan===
Afghanistan has had a couple of attempts at land reform.

In 1975, the government of president [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]] responded to the inequities of the existing land tenure conditions by issuing a Land Reform Law. It limited individual holdings to a maximum of 20 hectares of irrigated, double-cropped land. Larger holdings were allowed for less productive land. The government was to expropriate all surplus land and pay compensation. To prevent the proliferation of small, uneconomic holdings, priority for redistributed lands was to be given to neighboring farmers with two hectares or less. Landless sharecroppers, laborers, tenants, and nomads had next priority. Despite the government's rhetorical commitment to land reform, the program was quickly postponed. Because the government's landholding limits applied to families, not individuals, wealthy families avoided expropriation by dividing their lands nominally between family members. The high ceilings for landholdings restricted the amount of land actually subject to redistribution. Finally, the government lacked the technical data and organizational bodies to pursue the program after it was announced.

After the 1978 [[Saur Revolution]], the communist [[Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) issued Decree No. 6, which canceled gerau and other mortgage debts of agricultural laborers, tenants, and small landowners with less than two hectares of land. The cancellation applied only to debts contracted before 1973. The Decree No. 8 of November 1978 made new landholdings from the 20 hectares of prime irrigated land in the 1975 law to just six hectares. It divided all land into seven classes and again allowed for larger holdings of less productive land. There was no compensation for government-expropriated surplus land and it established categories of farmers who had priority for redistributed land; sharecroppers already working on the land had highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Country Study and Government Publication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/Agriculture.html Afghanistan Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{also|Mass killings of landlords under Mao Zedong}}
Since the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, China has been through a series of land reform programs. The founder of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]], [[Sun Yat-sen]], advocated a "[[Land reform|land to the tiller]]" program of [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang#History|equal distribution of land]]. which was partly implemented by the Nationalist Government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. In the 1940s, the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]], funded with American money, with the support of the national government, carried out land reform and community action programs in several provinces.

In October 1947, two years before the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Communist Party of China launched land reform campaigns that established control in North China villages.

In the mid-1950s, a second land reform during the [[Great Leap Forward]] compelled individual farmers to join collectives, which, in turn, were grouped into [[People's communes]] with centrally controlled [[property rights]] and an egalitarian principle of distribution. This policy was generally a failure in terms of production.&lt;ref name="Fao.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/sd/LTdirect/LTan0031.htm |title=SD: Institutions : Land reform in rural China since the mid-1980s, Part 1 |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223213916/http://www.fao.org/sd/LTdirect/LTan0031.htm |archivedate=2010-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC reversed this policy in 1962 through the proclamation of the Sixty Articles. As a result, the ownership of the basic means of production was divided into three levels with collective land ownership vested in the production team (see also Ho [2001]).

A third land reform beginning in the late 1970s re-introduced the family-based contract system known as the [[Responsibility system|Household Responsibility System]], was followed by a period of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. Chen, Wang, and Davis [1998] suggest that the stagnation was due, in part, to a system of periodic redistributions that encouraged [[over-exploitation]] rather than private [[capital investment]] in future [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="Fao.org"/&gt; However, although [[land use rights]] were returned to individual farmers, collective land ownership was left undefined after the disbandment of the People's Communes.

Since 1983, China has launched a series of land policy reforms to improve land-use efficiency, to rationalize land allocation, to enhance land management, and to coordinate urban and rural development. These land policy reforms have yielded positive impacts on urban land use as well as negative socioeconomic consequences. On the positive side, they have contributed to emerging land markets, increased government revenue for the financing of massive infrastructure projects and provision of public goods, and improved the rationalization of land use. On the negative side, problems such as loss of social equity, socioeconomic conflicts, and government corruption have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0264-8377(02)00073-x| title = Land policy reform in China: Assessment and prospects| journal = Land Use Policy| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 109–120| year = 2003| last1 = Ding | first1 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998 China is in the midst of drafting the new [[Property Law]] which is the first piece of national legislation that will define the land ownership structure in China for years to come. The Property Law forms the basis for China's future land policy of establishing a system of [[Fee simple|freehold]], rather than of [[private ownership]] (see also Ho, [2005]).

===India===
{{Main|Land reform in India}}
Under the British occupation, the land system in India has been feudalic, with few absentee landlords holding most of the lands and claiming high rents from poor peasants. The demand for a land reform was a major theme in the demand for independence. After independence, the different states in India gradually started a land reform process in four main categories: abolition of intermediaries (rent collectors under the pre-Independence land revenue system); tenancy regulation (to improve the contractual terms including security of tenure); a ceiling on landholdings (to redistribute surplus land to the landless); and attempts to consolidate disparate landholdings. The extent and success of these reforms varied greatly between the different states of India.

===Japan===
The first land reform in recent history, called the [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|Land Tax Reform]] or {{nihongo||地租改正|chisokaisei}}, passed in 1873, six years after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. It established the right of private land ownership in Japan for the first time and was a major restructuring of the previous land taxation system.

The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system and the government responded by forcefully changing land values to meet the set amount if self-reported values did not meet projected values. This caused widespread resentment among farmers and several large-scale riots, causing the government to lower the tax rate from 3% to 2.5%. The department continued its aggressive taxation until 1878, but the strictness of rules gradually decreased as it became clear that required amounts would be met. By 1880, seven years after the start of the land reforms, the new system had been completely implemented.

Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. Previously, individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English (and later United Kingdom) statute [[Quia Emptores]] enacted several centuries earlier.

Another major land reform was carried out in 1947, during the [[Occupied Japan|occupied era]] after World War II, under instructions of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] based on a proposal from the Japanese government which had been prepared before the defeat of the [[Empire of Japan|Greater Japanese Empire]]. This last reform is also called {{nihongo||農地解放|Nōchi-kaihō|emancipation of farming land}}.

Between 1947 and 1949, approximately {{convert|5800000|acre|km2}} of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) was purchased from the  [[landlord]]s under the reform program and re-sold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Flores 1970, p. 901.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{Main|Land reform in the Philippines}}
During the [[Diosdado Macapagal|Macapagal]] administration in the early 1960s, a limited land reform program was initiated in [[Central Luzon]] covering rice fields.

During the martial law era of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] Administration, Presidential Decree 27 instituted a land reform program covering rice and corn farms. Rice and corn production under this land reform program was heavily supported by the Marcos Administration with land distribution and financing program known as the Masagana 99 and other production loans that led to increased rice and corn production. The country produced enough rice for local consumption and became a rice exporter during that period.

The [[Corazon Aquino]] Administration in the mid-1980s instituted a very controversial land reform known as CARP, which covered all agricultural lands. The program led to rice shortages in the succeeding years and lasted for 20 years without accomplishing the goal of land distribution. The program caused entrepreneurs to stay away from agriculture and a number of productive farmers left the farming sector. The CARP was a monumental failure in terms of cost to the government and the landowners whose lands were subjective to legal landgrabbing by the government. CARP expired at the end of December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/agrarianreform/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090103-181229 CARP not renewed], Inquirer.net, 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In 1972, the Government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], through the Land Reform Law, imposed a ceiling of twenty hectares on privately owned land and sought to distribute lands in excess of the ceiling for the benefit of landless peasants. Both land owned by public companies and paddy lands under ten hectares in extent were exempted from this ceiling. Between 1972 and 1974, the Land Reform Commission took over nearly 228,000 hectares. In 1975 the Land Reform (Amendment) Law brought over 169,000 hectares of plantations owned by companies (including British-owned companies) under state control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13209.html |title=Sri Lanka land reform legislation |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
From 1945 to 1950, United States and South Korean authorities carried out a land reform that retained the institution of private property. They confiscated and redistributed all land held by the Japanese colonial government, Japanese companies, and individual Japanese colonists. The Korean government carried out a reform whereby Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. A new class of independent, family proprietors was created.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Land reform in Taiwan}}
In the 1950s, after the Nationalist government came to Taiwan, land reform and community development was carried out by the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]]. This course of action was made attractive, in part, by the fact that many of the large landowners were Japanese who had fled, and the other large landowners were compensated with Japanese commercial and industrial properties seized after Taiwan reverted from Japanese rule in 1945. The land program succeeded also because the [[Kuomintang]] were mostly from the mainland and had few ties to the remaining indigenous landowners. See also: [[Taiwan Land Reform Museum]]

===Vietnam===
{{Main|Land reform in Vietnam}}{{Main|Land reform in South Vietnam}}{{Main|Land reform in North Vietnam}}

In the years after [[World War II]], land redistribution to poor and landless peasants was initiated by the communist [[Viet Minh]] insurgents in areas which they controlled.  After the partition of the country into two parts ([[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]), the communist land reform (1953–1956) redistributed land to more than 2 million poor peasants, but at a cost of thousands, possibly tens of thousands of lives &lt;ref&gt;''The Viet Minh Regime, Government and Administration in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam'', Bernard Fall, Greenwood Press, Connecticut, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the exodus of up to 1 million people from the North to the South in 1954 and 1955.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The land reform campaign was accompanied by large-scale repression and excesses.&lt;ref name="Nhan_VietEconPol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nhan|first1=Vo Tri|title=Vietnam's Economic Policy Since 1975|date=1990|publisher=Institute for Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-3035-54-6|pages=2–7|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y7htC9I_J34C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=vo+nhan+tri#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were subsequently criticized within the ruling Workers Party of Vietnam itself.&lt;ref name="Nhan_VietEconPol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moise_LandRef"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moise|first1=Edwin E.|title=Land Reform and Land Reform Errors in North Vietnam|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=49|issue=1, Sping 1976|pages=84–85|doi=10.2307/2756362|jstor=2756362|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Communist Party of Vietnam, ''Kinh nghiệm giải quyết vấn đề ruộng đất trong cách mạng Việt Nam'' (Experience in land reform in the Vietnamese Revolution), available online: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120020044/http://dangcongsan.vn/details.asp?topic=2&amp;subtopic=5&amp;leader_topic=79&amp;id=BT1060374012 Bao Dien tu Dang Cong san Viet Nam]&lt;/ref&gt;

South Vietnam made several further attempts in the post-[[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] years, the most ambitious being the [[Land to the Tiller (South Vietnam)|Land to the Tiller]] program instituted in 1970 by President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]]. This limited individuals to 15 hectares, compensated the owners of expropriated tracts, and extended legal title to peasants who in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom had land had previously been distributed by the [[Viet Cong]].

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M. Tung| title = Preserving the world's great cities:The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis|edition= 2001| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn= 0-517-70148-0|url=http://www.anthonymtung.com/excerpts.htm#Chap4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While extensively damaged by the failed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]], the city later underwent a [[Destruction of Warsaw|planned demolition]] by German forces under order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and high officials within the Nazi government. On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

The '''Thirty Tyrants''' ([[Latin]]: ''Tyranni Triginta'') were a series of thirty rulers who appear in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' as having ostensibly been [[pretender]]s to the throne of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of the emperor [[Gallienus]].

Given the notorious unreliability of the ''Historia Augusta'', the veracity of this list is debatable; there is a scholarly consensus that the author deliberately inflated the number of pretenders in order to parallel the [[Thirty Tyrants|Thirty Tyrants of Athens]].

The ''Historia'' actually gives 32 names; however, because the author (who wrote under the name of [[Trebellius Pollio]]) places the last two during the reigns of [[Maximinus Thrax]] and [[Claudius II]] respectively, this leaves thirty alleged pretenders during the reign of Gallienus.

The following list gives the Thirty Tyrants as depicted by the ''Historia Augusta'', along with notes contrasting the Historia Augusta's claims with their actual historical positions:

Notwithstanding the author's pretensions regarding the time during which these persons aspired to the throne, this list includes:
*two women and six youths who never claimed imperial dignity
*seven men who either certainly or probably never claimed imperial dignity
*three probably and two possibly fictitious persons
*two pretenders admittedly not contemporary with Gallienus
*three pretenders not contemporary with Gallienus

Leaving nine pretenders roughly contemporary with Gallienus. According to David Magie (the editor of the Loeb Classical Library edition of the ''Historia Augusta''), at least some of these men issued coins.

Most human civilizations - [[History of India|India]], [[History of China|China]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca Empire|Inca]], among others - based their culture on complex systems of [[astrology]], which provided a link between the cosmos with the conditions and events on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ayurvedic Astrology: Self-healing Through the Stars|last=Frawley|first=David|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2005|isbn=8120831349|location=Twin Lakes, Wisconsin|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, the astrological practice was not mere divination because it also served as the foundation for their spiritual culture and knowledge-systems used for practical purposes such as the calendar (see [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] calendrical shamans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Astrology through History: Interpreting the Stars from Ancient Mesopotamia to the Present|last=Burns|first=William|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2018|isbn=9781440851421|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and medicine (e.g. ''[[I Ching]]''). Astrological tradition even contributed to the development of [[astronomy]] as the study of the skies provided invaluable insights about celestial bodies. For instance, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] astrological tradition has already listed some of the planets in the [[Solar System|solar system]] and their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sefer Ḥakhmoni|last=Mancuso|first=Piergabriele|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn=9789004167629|location=Leiden|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Queen of Scots reenactor.jpg|right|thumb|A reenactress playing the role of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] at a Scottish fair in 2003.]]

'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0703-021, Schwerin, Indianistiktreffen.jpg|thumb|Eastern German Living history at an "Indianistikmeeting" 1982 in [[Schwerin]]]]
[[File:Guédelon - mai 2014 - 24.JPG|thumb|The [[Guédelon Castle]] in France is a castle currently built using only medieval construction techniques, tools, costumes and local materials.]]
Living history approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),&lt;ref Name="Ban"&gt;Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem Häkelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer Überblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, Köln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beiträgen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander Häusler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt;

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt; started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys.

==Activities==

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
[[File:Vikingtent.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Viking encampment.]]

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In education==

[[File:Lincoln living.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Abraham Lincoln in present time.]]
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  “Interpreters” are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual’s personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered “folk artifacts,” which are grouped under the heading of “material culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Experiential learning]], "About"&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], “That the Future May Learn from the Past,” proclaims the site’s commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled “Applied History,” in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.&lt;ref&gt;James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched. Marxian analyses of the legal system, of the social role of women, of foreign trade, of international rivalries among capitalist nations, and the role of parliamentary democracy in the transition to socialism drew animated debates&amp;nbsp;... Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of [[classical Marxism]] while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts, which has then led to contradictory conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=September 2003|isbn=978-0-415-24187-8|page=107|quote=Marxist political economists differ over their definitions of capitalism, socialism and communism. These differences are so fundamental, the arguments among differently persuaded Marxist political economists have sometimes been as intense as their oppositions to political economies that celebrate capitalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lately there is movement toward the recognition that [[historical materialism]] and [[dialectical materialism]] remains the fundamental aspect of all [[Marxist schools of thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should result in more agreement between different schools.

The term "Marxism" was popularized by [[Karl Kautsky]], who considered himself an "orthodox" Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"&gt;Georges Haupt, Peter Fawcett, Eric Hobsbawm.

Pp. 12"/&gt; In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed "Marxist" [[Paul Lafargue]], by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered "Marxist", then "one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010.

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is property of the society as whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoDickson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Hugo-Chavéz Vota.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chavez]] casting a vote in 2007 ]]
[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Criticisms of socialism|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal. [https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333"The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070247/https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333|date=23 July 2011}} ''Socialist Register''. Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam.

Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social origins in nature ==

=== Origin of social groups ===
==== Hobbes ====
[[Image:Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece of "Leviathan," by [[Abraham Bosse]], with input from Hobbes]]
Arguably the most influential theory of human social origins is that of [[Thomas Hobbes]], who in his ''Leviathan''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill, ed. by Ian Shapiro (Yale University Press; 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that without strong government, society would collapse into ''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' — "the war of all against all":
{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.|{{Citation|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.}}}} Hobbes' innovation was to attribute the establishment of society to a founding '[[social contract]]', in which the Crown's subjects surrender some part of their freedom in return for security.

If Hobbes' idea is accepted, it follows that society could not have emerged prior to the state. This school of thought has remained influential to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Runciman (ed.), ''The Origin of Human Social Institutions.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in this respect is British archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] (Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn), who points out that the state did not emerge until long after the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''. The earliest representatives of our species, according to Renfrew, may well have been ''anatomically'' modern, but they were not yet ''cognitively'' or ''behaviourally'' modern. For example, they lacked political leadership, large-scale cooperation, food production, organised religion, law or symbolic artefacts. Humans were simply hunter-gatherers, who — much like extant apes — ate whatever food they could find in the vicinity. Renfrew controversially suggests that hunter-gatherers to this day think and socialise along lines not radically different from those of their nonhuman primate counterparts. In particular, he says that they do not "ascribe symbolic meaning to material objects" and for that reason "lack fully developed 'mind.'"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, hunter-gatherer ethnographers emphasise that extant foraging peoples certainly do have social institutions — notably institutionalised rights and duties codified in formal systems of kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi Strauss, C. 1969. ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. London: Eyre and Spottiswoode.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate rituals such as initiation ceremonies serve to cement contracts and commitments, quite independently of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gennep, A. 1960 [1909] ''The Rites of Passage.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars would add that insofar as we can speak of "human revolutions" — "major transitions" in human evolution&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J. and E. Szathmáry 1995. ''The Major Transitions in Evolution.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; — the first was not the Neolithic Revolution but the rise of symbolic culture that occurred toward the end of the Middle Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., C. Power and I. Watts 1995. The human symbolic revolution: A Darwinian account. ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal.'' 5(1): 75–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing the exact opposite of Hobbes's position, anarchist anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] views the state and society as mutually incompatible: genuine society is always struggling to survive ''against'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;Clastres, P. 1977. ''[[Society Against the State]].'' Trans. R. Hurley in collaboration with A. Stein. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Rousseau in 1753]]
Like Hobbes, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that society was born in a social contract. In Rousseau's case, however, sovereignty is vested in the entire populace, who enter into the contract directly with one another. "The problem", he explained, "is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution. The contract's clauses, Rousseau continued, may be reduced to one — "the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community. Each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has". In other words: "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole." At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J.-J. 1973 [1762]. The social contract. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''The Social Contract and Discourses.'' ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I, Ch. 6.''&lt;/ref&gt; By this means, each member of the community acquires not only the capacities of the whole but also, for the first time, rational mentality:

{{quotation|The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations.|{{Citation|title= ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau,'' The Social Contract and Discourses. ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I Ch. 8.''}}}}

====Sir Henry Sumner Maine====
In his influential book, ''Ancient Law'' (1861), Maine argued that in early times, the basic unit of human social organisation was the patriarchal family:

[[Image:Maine by Dickinson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir Henry James Sumner Maine]]{{quotation|The effect of the evidence derived from comparative jurisprudence is to establish the view of the primeval condition of the human race which is known as the Patriarchal Theory.|{{Citation|title= ''Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p. 122.''}}}}

Hostile to French revolutionary and other radical social ideas, Maine's motives were partly political. He sought to undermine the legacy of Rousseau and other advocates of man’s natural rights by asserting that originally, no one had any rights at all – ‘every man, living during the greater part of his life under the patriarchal despotism, was practically controlled in all his actions by a regimen not of law but of caprice’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were the patriarch’s children subject to what Maine calls his ‘despotism’: his wife and his slaves were equally affected. The very notion of kinship, according to Maine, was simply a way of categorizing those who were forcibly subjected to the despot’s arbitrary rule. Maine later added a Darwinian strand to this argument. In his ''The Descent of Man,'' Darwin had cited reports that a wild-living male gorilla would monopolise for itself as large a harem of females as it could violently defend. Maine endorsed Darwin’s speculation that ‘primeval man’ probably 'lived in small communities, each with as many wives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men’.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to spell out exactly what he meant by the term 'patriarchy', Maine clarified that ‘sexual jealousy, indulged through power, might serve as a definition of the Patriarchal Family’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1883. ''Early Law and Custom.'' London: John Murray, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lewis Henry Morgan ====
[[File:Lewishenrymorgan.jpg|200px|thumb|Lewis H. Morgan]]
In his influential book, ''Ancient Society'' (1877), its title echoing Maine's ''Ancient Law,'' [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] proposed a very different theory. Morgan insisted that throughout the earlier periods of human history, neither the state nor the family existed.

{{quotation| It may be here premised that all forms of government are reducible to two general plans, using the word plan in its scientific sense. In their bases the two are fundamentally distinct. The first, in the order of time, is founded upon persons, and upon relations purely personal, and may be distinguished as a society ''(societas)''. The gens is the unit of this organization; giving as the successive stages of integration, in the archaic period, the gens, the phratry, the tribe, and the confederacy of tribes, which constituted a people or nation (''populus''). At a later period a coalescence of tribes in the same area into a nation took the place of a confederacy of tribes occupying independent areas. Such, through prolonged ages, after the gens appeared, was the substantially universal organization of ancient society; and it remained among the Greeks and Romans after civilization supervened. The second is founded upon territory and upon property, and may be distinguished as a state ''(civitas).''|{{Citation|title= ''Morgan, L. H. 1877.'' Ancient Society. ''Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, p. 6.''}}}} In place of both family and state, according to Morgan, was the ''gens'' — nowadays termed the 'clan' — based initially on matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent. This aspect of Morgan's theory, later endorsed by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, is nowadays widely considered discredited (but for a critical survey of the current consensus, see Knight 2008, 'Early Human Kinship Was Matrilineal'&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf Early human kinship was matrilineal]. In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Frederick Engels ====
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|Frederick Engels]]

[[Frederick Engels]] built on Morgan's ideas in his 1884 essay, ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State in the light of the researches of Lewis Henry Morgan.'' His primary interest was the position of women in early society, and — in particular — Morgan's insistence that the matrilineal clan preceded the family as society's fundamental unit. 'The mother-right gens', wrote Engels in his survey of contemporary historical materialist scholarship, 'has become the pivot around which the entire science turns...' Engels argued that the matrilineal clan represented a principle of self-organization so vibrant and effective that it allowed no room for patriarchal dominance or the territorial state.{{quotation|The first class antagonism which appears in human history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male.|{{Citation|title= ''Engels, F. 1940 [1884]'' The origin of the family, private property and the state.

====Emile Durkheim====
{{Infobox scientist
|name = Émile Durkheim
|image = Emile_Durkheim.jpg
|image_size = 200px}}

[[Emile Durkheim]] considered that in order to exist, any human social system must counteract the natural tendency for the sexes to promiscuously conjoin. He argued that social order presupposes sexual morality, which is expressed in prohibitions against sex with certain people or during certain periods — in traditional societies particularly during menstruation.

{{quotation|One first fact is certain: that is, that the entire system of prohibitions must strictly conform to the ideas that primitive man had about menstruation and about menstrual blood. For all these taboos start only with the onset of puberty: and it is only when the first signs of blood appear that they reach their maximum rigour.|{{Citation|title= ''Durkheim, E. 1963 [1898]. La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines.'' L'Année Sociologique ''1: 1–70. Reprinted as'' Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, ''trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart, p. 81.''}}}}

The incest taboo, wrote Durkheim in 1898, is no more than a particular example of something more basic and universal - the ritualistic setting apart of 'the sacred' from 'the profane'. This begins as the segregation of the sexes, each of which - at least on important occasions - is 'sacred' or 'set apart' from the other. 'The two sexes', as Durkheim explains, 'must avoid each other with the same care as the profane flees from the sacred and the sacred from the profane.' Women as sisters act out the role of 'sacred' beings invested 'with an isolating power of some sort, a power which holds the masculine population at a distance.' Their menstrual blood in particular sets them in a category apart, exercising a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. In this way, the earliest ritual structure emerges — establishing morally regulated 'society' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l’inceste et ses origines. ''L’Année Sociologique'' 1: 1–70. Reprinted as ''Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo,'' trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sigmund Freud====
[[Charles Darwin]] pictured early human society as resembling that of apes, with one or more dominant males jealously guarding a harem of females.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In his myth of the 'Primal Horde', [[Sigmund Freud]] later took all this as his starting point but then postulated an insurrection mounted by the tyrant's own sons:{{quotation|All that we find there is a violent and jealous father who keeps all the females for himself and drives away his sons as they grow up…. One day the brothers who had been driven out came together, killed and devoured their father and so made an end of the patriarchal horde.|{{Citation|title= ''Freud, S. 1965 [1913].'' Totem and Taboo. ''London: Routledge, p. 141.''}}}} Following this, the band of brothers were about to take sexual possession of their mothers and sisters when suddenly they were overcome with remorse. In their contradictory emotional state, their dead father now became stronger than the living one had been. In memory of him, the brothers revoked their deed by forbidding the killing and eating of the 'totem' (as their father had now become) and renouncing their claim to the women who had just been set free. In this way, the two fundamental taboos of primitive society – not to eat the totem and not to marry one's sisters – were established for the first time.

====Marshall Sahlins====
A related but less dramatic version of Freud's 'sexual revolution' idea was proposed in 1960 by American social anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins, M. D. 1960. The origin of society. ''Scientific American'' 203(3): 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow, he writes, the world of primate brute competition and sexual dominance was turned upside-down: {{quotation|The decisive battle between early culture and human nature must have been waged on the field of [[primate sexuality]]….  Among subhuman primates sex had organized society; the customs of hunters and gatherers testify eloquently that now society was to organize sex…. In selective adaptation to the perils of the Stone Age, human society overcame or subordinated such primate propensities as selfishness, indiscriminate sexuality, dominance and brute competition. It substituted kinship and co-operation for conflict, placed solidarity over sex, morality over might. In its earliest days it accomplished the greatest reform in history, the overthrow of human primate nature, and thereby secured the evolutionary future of the species.|{{Citation|title= ''Sahlins, M. D. 1960 The origin of society.'' Scientific American ''203(3): 76–87.''}}}}

==== Christopher Boehm ====
{{quotation| Once a prehistoric hunting band institutionalized a successful and decisive rebellion, and did away with the alpha-male role permanently... it is easy to see how this institution would have spread.|{{Citation|title=''Boehm, C. 2000.'' ''Journal of Consciousness Studies 7, 1–2 pp. 79–101; p. 97.''}}}}
If we accept Rousseau's line of reasoning, no single dominant individual is needed to embody society, to guarantee security or to enforce social contracts. The people themselves can do these things, combining to enforce the general will. A modern origins theory along these lines is that of evolutionary anthropologist [[Christopher Boehm]]. Boehm argues that ape social organisation tends to be despotic, typically with one or more dominant males monopolising access to the locally available females. But wherever there is dominance, we can also expect resistance. In the human case, resistance to being personally dominated intensified as humans used their social intelligence to form coalitions. Eventually, a point was reached when the costs of attempting to impose dominance became so high that the strategy was no longer evolutionarily stable, whereupon social life tipped over into 'reverse dominance' — defined as a situation in which only the entire community, on guard against primate-style individual dominance, is permitted to use force to suppress deviant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ernest Gellner ====
Human beings, writes social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, are not genetically programmed to be members of this or that social order. You can take a human infant and place it into any kind of social order and it will function acceptably. What makes human society so distinctive is the fabulous range of quite different forms it takes across the world. Yet in any given society, the range of permitted behaviours is quite narrowly constrained. This is not owing to the existence of any externally imposed system of rewards and punishments. The constraints come from within — from certain compulsive moral concepts which members of the social order have internalised. The society installs these concepts in each individual's psyche in the manner first identified by Emile Durkheim, namely, by means of collective rituals such as initiation rites. Therefore, the problem of the origins of society boils down to the problem of the origins of collective ritual.

{{quotation|How is a  society established, and a series of societies diversified, whilst each of them is restrained from chaotically exploiting that wide diversity of possible human behaviour? A theory is available concerning how this may be done and it is one of the basic theories of social anthropology. The way in which you restrain people from doing a wide variety of things, not compatible with the social order of which they are members, is that you subject them to ritual. The process is simple: you make them dance around a totem pole until they are wild with excitement, and become jellies in the hysteria of collective frenzy; you enhance their emotional state by any device, by all the locally available audio-visual aids, drugs, music and so on; and once they are really high, you stamp upon their minds the type of concept or notion to which they subsequently become enslaved.|{{Citation|title=''Gellner, E. 1988. Origins of Society. In A. C. Fabian (ed.),'' Origins. The Darwin College Lectures. ''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.128–140; p. 130.''}}}}

===Gender and origins===
Feminist scholars — among them palaeoanthropologists Leslie Aiello and Camilla Power — take similar arguments a step further, arguing that any reform or revolution which overthrew male dominance must surely have been led by women. Evolving human females, Power and Aiello suggest, actively separated themselves from males on a periodic basis, using their own blood (and/or pigments such as red ochre) to mark themselves as fertile and defiant: {{quotation|The sexual division of labor entails differentiation of roles in food procurement, with logistic hunting of large game by males, co-operation and exchange of products. Our hypothesis is that symbolism arose in this context. To minimize energetic costs of travel, coalitions of women began to invest in home bases. To secure this strategy, women would have to use their attractive, collective signal of impending fertility in a wholly new way: by signalling refusal of sexual access except to males who returned "home" with provisions. Menstruation — real or artificial — while biologically the wrong time for fertile sex, is psychologically the right moment for focusing men's minds on imminent hunting, since it offers the prospect of fertile sex in the near future.|{{Citation|title= ''Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.),'' Women in Human Evolution. ''New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153–171; p. 159.''}}}} In similar vein, anthropologist Chris Knight argues that Boehm's idea of a 'coalition of everyone' is hard to envisage, unless — along the lines of a modern industrial picket line — it was formed to co-ordinate 'sex-strike' action against badly behaving males: {{quotation|....male dominance had to be overthrown because the unending prioritising of male short-term sexual interests could lead only to the permanence and institutionalisation of behavioural conflict between the sexes, between the generations and also between rival males. If the symbolic, cultural domain was to emerge, what was needed was a political collectivity — an alliance — capable of transcending such conflicts. ... Only the consistent defence and self-defence of mothers with their offspring could produce a collectivity embodying interests of a sufficiently broad, universalistic kind.|{{Citation|title=''Knight, C. 1991.'' Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture. ''New Haven and London: Yale University Press'', p. 514}}}} In virtually all hunter-gatherer ethnographies, according to Knight, a persistent theme is that 'women like meat',&lt;ref&gt;Biesele, M. 1993. ''Women Like Meat. The folklore and foraging ideology of the Kalahari Ju/'hoan.'' Witwatersrand: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they determinedly use their collective bargaining power to motivate men to hunt for them and bring home their kills — on pain of exclusion from sex.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991.

==Sociobiological theories==
=== Robert Trivers ===

{{quotation|I consider Trivers one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that he has provided a scientific explanation for the human condition: the intricately complicated and endlessly fascinating relationships that bind us to one another.|[https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/trivers04/trivers04_index.html ''Steven Pinker on Robert Trivers'']}}

In his 1985 book, ''Social Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution''. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Trivers]] outlines the theoretical framework used today by most evolutionary biologists to understand how and why societies are established. Trivers sets out from the fundamental fact that genes survive beyond the death of the bodies they inhabit, because copies of the same gene may be replicated in multiple different bodies. From this, it follows that a creature should behave altruistically to the extent that those benefiting carry the same genes — 'inclusive fitness', as this source of cooperation in nature is termed.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 7: 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Where animals are unrelated, cooperation should be limited to 'reciprocal altruism' or 'tit-for-tat'.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1971. The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 46 (1): 35–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Where previously, biologists took parent-offspring cooperation for granted, Trivers predicted on theoretical grounds both cooperation and conflict — as when a mother needs to wean an existing baby (even against its will) in order to make way for another.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1974. Parent-Offspring Conflict. ''American Zoologist'' 14 (1): 249–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, biologists had interpreted male infanticidal behaviour as aberrant and inexplicable or, alternatively, as a necessary strategy for culling excess population.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V.C. 1962. ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour.'' Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; Trivers was able to show that such behaviour was a logical strategy by males to enhance their own reproductive success at the expense of conspecifics including rival males. Ape or monkey females whose babies are threatened have directly opposed interests, often forming coalitions to defend themselves and their offspring against infanticidal males.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings, pp 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;
Human society, according to Trivers, is unusual in that it involves the male of the species investing parental care in his own offspring — a rare pattern for a primate. Where such cooperation occurs, it's not enough to take it for granted: in Trivers' view we need to ''explain'' it using an overarching theoretical framework applicable to humans and nonhumans alike.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1972. Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (ed.) ''Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871–1971''. Chicago, Aldine, pp. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|Everybody has a social life. All living creatures reproduce and reproduction is a social event, since at its bare minimum it involves the genetic and material construction of one individual by another. In turn, differences between individuals in the number of their surviving offspring (natural selection) is the driving force behind organic evolution. Life is intrinsically social and it evolves through a process of natural selection which is itself social. For these reasons social evolution refers not only to the evolution of social relationships between individuals but also to deeper themes of biological organization stretching from gene to community.|{{Citation|title=''Robert Trivers, 1985.''

=== Robin Dunbar ===

[[Image: Robin Dunbar (6293027302).jpg |thumb|right|200px|Robin Dunbar]][[Robin Dunbar]] originally studied gelada baboons in the wild in Ethiopia, and has done much to synthesise modern primatological knowledge with Darwinian theory into a comprehensive overall picture. The components of primate social systems 'are essentially alliances of a political nature aimed at enabling the animals concerned to achieve more effective solutions to particular problems of survival and reproduction'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Primate societies are in essence 'multi-layered sets of coalitions'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although physical fights are ultimately decisive, the social mobilisation of allies usually decides matters and requires skills that go beyond mere fighting ability. The manipulation and use of coalitions demands sophisticated social — more precisely ''political'' — intelligence.
Usually but not always, males exercise dominance over females. Even where male despotism prevails, females typically gang up with one another to pursue agendas of their own. When a male gelada baboon attacks a previously dominant rival so as to take over his harem, the females concerned may insist on their own say in the outcome. At various stages during the fighting, the females may 'vote' among themselves on whether to accept the provisional outcome. Rejection is signalled by refusing to groom the challenger; acceptance is signalled by going up to him and grooming him. According to Dunbar, the ultimate outcome of an inter-male 'sexual fight' always depends on the female 'vote'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, pp. 166, 167, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dunbar points out that in a primate social system, lower-ranking females will typically suffer the most intense harassment. Consequently, they will be the first to form coalitions in self-defence. But maintaining commitment from coalition allies involves much time-consuming manual grooming, putting pressure on time-budgets. In the case of evolving humans, who were living in increasingly large groups, the costs would soon have outweighed the benefits — unless some more efficient way of maintaining relationships could be found. Dunbar argues that 'vocal grooming' — using the voice to signal commitment — was the time-saving solution adopted, and that this led eventually to speech. Dunbar goes on to suggest (citing evolutionary anthropologist Chris Knight&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2011 [1989]. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_origins_hs.pdf ''The origins of society.''] London: Radical Anthropology Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991. ''Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture.'' New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) that ''distinctively human'' society may have been evolved under pressure from female ritual and 'gossiping' coalitions established to dissuade males from fighting one another and instead cooperate in hunting for the benefit of the whole camp: {{quotation| If females formed the core of these early groups, and language evolved to bond these groups, it naturally follows that the early human females were the first to speak. This reinforces the suggestion that language was first used to create a sense of emotional solidarity between allies. Chris Knight has argued a passionate case for the idea that language first evolved to allow the females in these early groups to band together to force males to invest in them and their offspring, principally by hunting for meat. This would be consistent with the fact that, among modern humans, women are generally better at verbal skills than men, as well as being more skilful in the social domain. |{{Citation|title=''Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996.'' Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language. ''London: Faber and Faber, p. 149.''}}}} Dunbar stresses that this is currently a minority theory among specialists in human origins — most still support the 'bison-down-at-the-lake' theory attributing early language and cooperation to the imperatives of men's activities such as hunting. Despite this, he argues that 'female bonding may have been a more powerful force in human evolution than is sometimes supposed'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996. ''Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language.'' London: Faber and Faber, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Although still controversial, the idea that female coalitions may have played a decisive role has subsequently received strong support from a number of anthropologists including Sarah Hrdy,&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy,  S. B. 2009. ''Mothers and others. The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding.'' London and Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power,&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. 1998. Old wives’ tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals.

[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Delian League]] before the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC.]]
'''''Pentecontaetia''''' ({{lang-el|πεντηκονταετία}}, "the period of fifty years") is the term used to refer to the period in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] history between the defeat of the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] in 479 BC and the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. The term originated with a scholiast on [[Thucydides]], who used it in their description of the period. The ''Pentecontaetia'' was marked by the rise of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] as the dominant state in the Greek world and by the rise of [[Athenian democracy]]. Since Thucydides focused his account on these developments, the term is generally used when discussing developments in and involving Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ehrenberg and P.J. Rhodes, "Pentecontaetia," from ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Greek victory of 479 BC, Athens assumed the leadership of the [[Delian League]], a coalition of states that wished to continue the war against Persia. This league experienced a [[Wars of the Delian League|number of successes]] and was soon established as the dominant military force of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  Athenian control over the league grew as some "allies" were reduced to the status of tribute-paying subjects and by the middle of the 5th century BC (the league treasury was moved from [[Delos]] to Athens in 454 BC) the league had been transformed into an Athenian empire.  Athens benefited greatly from this tribute, undergoing a [[Fifth Century Athens|cultural renaissance]] and undertaking massive public building projects, including the [[Parthenon]]; Athenian democracy, meanwhile, developed into what is today called radical or [[Periclean democracy]], in which the popular [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly of the citizens]] and the large, citizen juries exercised near-complete control over the state.

The later years of the ''Pentecontaetia'' were marked by increasing conflict between Athens and the traditional land powers of Greece, led by [[Sparta]]. Between 460 BC and 445 BC, Athens fought a shifting coalition of mainland powers in what is now known as the [[First Peloponnesian War]]. During the course of this conflict, Athens gained and then lost control of large areas of [[central Greece]].  The conflict was concluded by the [[Thirty Years' Peace]], which lasted until the end of the ''Pentecontaetia'' and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.

The eventual breakdown of the peace was triggered by increasing conflict between Athens and several of Sparta's allies. Athens' alliance with [[Corcyra]] and attack on [[Potidaea]] enraged [[Corinth]], and the [[Megarian decree]] imposed strict economic sanctions on Megara, another Spartan ally.  These disputes, along with a general perception that Athenian power had grown too powerful, led to the breakdown of the Thirty Years Peace; the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC.

== Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480—431) ==
'''479'''—Rebuilding of Athens: Although the Greeks were victorious in the Persian War, many Greeks believed that the Persians would retaliate. This led Athens to rebuild its long walls that were razed by the Persian Army during the occupation of [[Attica]] in 480.

'''478'''—Formation of the Delian League: Athens and other city states form a coalition against Persia.

'''477'''—The Conquest of Eion: [[Cimon]], the son of Miltiades of Marathon fame, led Athens to numerous victorious campaigns and war profits. In 477, he led an army against Persian-occupied Eion in northern Greece. Athens was able to benefit from this invasion since the region was rich in timber, which was critical to building Athens' burgeoning naval fleet.

'''476'''—The Conquest of Scyros: The invasions continued with success on a par with Cimon's prior campaigns. In 476, Athens fought against the pirates of Scyros, as the Delian League wanted to reduce piracy around the region and capture the important materials for itself.

'''469'''—Operation in Asia Minor and the Battle of Eurymedon: From the beginning of 469 to 466, the Delian league led an army to [[Asia Minor]] against Persia. Cimon persuaded Greek settlements on the Carian and Lycian coast to rebel against Persia. This led the Persian army to mobilize a force to fight Cimon in the [[Battle of Eurymedon]] in [[Pamphylsia]]. Cimon was able to defeat the Persian army swiftly and the war profits were used to finance Athens' city walls.

'''465'''—Operations in Northern Greece: Athens' powers and desire for expansion grow. In 465, after [[Cleruchy|cleruchizing]] the Chersonese, they tried to gain control of [[Thasos]]. Thucydides wrote that Sparta contemplated an invasion of Attica in order to help free Thasos. However, in the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake and subsequent helot uprising in Sparta, no attack—if indeed such was projected—was launched.

'''461'''—The Debate in Athens over Helping Sparta: With a legion of [[Helot]]s rebelling against Sparta, Athens offered Sparta their help by sending a force of 4,000 [[Hoplite]]s to suppress the rebels. According to Thucydides, Sparta decided to dismiss Cimon's Athenian Army, because they felt that Athens would convince the Helots on [[Ithome]] to form a coalition and besiege Sparta. Spartans did not feel comfortable with such a large Athenian force inside their city. If the Athenians were to turn their backs on Sparta, the city would not be able to protect itself. At this point, Sparta acknowledged that Athens might be getting too powerful. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were deeply offended by their removal from Ithome. They denounced their original treaty with Sparta made during the Greco-Persian Wars, then proceeded to make an alliance with [[Argos]], a major enemy of the Spartans. 

'''460'''—Athens' Clash with Corinth over Megara: Megarians joined the Delian League due to a war between Megara and Corinth. This angered the Corinthians. Even using Athens' weakest soldiers, being the old and young men who were left behind in the city, they were able to win the war against Corinth with ease.

'''460'''—The Athenian Expedition to Egypt: Athens led a coalition with the Egyptians to rebel against Persia. However, their six-year expedition did not lead to much success against Persia, as 100 Athenian ships were destroyed in the Delta region.

'''458'''—The Long Walls: The construction of the long walls gave Athens a major military advantage by forming a barrier around the city-state and its harbors, which allowed their ships to access waterways without threat from outside forces. Two walls were constructed from the city to the sea, one to [[Phaleron]] and the other to [[Piraeus]]. Athens relied on these long walls to protect itself from invasion, while sending off its superior vessels to bombard opponents' cities.

'''458'''—The Battle of Tanagra: According to Thucydides, Spartans aided the Dorians by invading Greece, because they were motivated by ethnic solidarity. Sparta sent out 1500 Hoplites and an additional 10,000 from their allies' forces to suppress the Phocians' Army invading Doris. The Spartans were victorious, but they found themselves stuck in this foreign land. Athens, suspecting a plot by the Spartans to overthrow the democracy and to prevent the building of the Long Walls, then attacked the Spartans at Tanagra in [[Boeotia]] with a force of 14,000. The Spartans were victorious in this battle.

'''457'''—The Battle of Oenophyta: After the Spartans returned home from Tanagra, the Athenians conquered Boetia and [[Phocis]] after a battle at [[Oenophyta]]. They then proceeded to tear down Tanagra's fortifications. 

'''450'''—The Peace of Callias—Although this peace treaty is subject to scholarly debate, allegedly Athens and Persia agreed to a ceasefire.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peace of Callias {{!}} ancient Greece-Persia [450 449 BC]|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-Callias|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''447'''—Athens' forces were defeated at Coronea, causing the Athenian army to flee [[Boeotia]].

'''446'''—The Peloponnesian Invasion of Attica: Athens continued their indirect war with Sparta by attempting to gain control of Delphi. City-states such as Megara and Euboea began to rebel against Athens and the Delian League when the Spartan Army invaded Athenian territory.

'''445'''—The Thirty-Year Peace Between Athens and Sparta: After losing Attica, Boeotia and Megara, Athens agreed to a thirty-year peace in return for all the conquered areas in the Peloponnesian region. From this point on, all future conflicts between Athens and Sparta were resolved under arbitration.

'''447'''—Athenian Colonization and the Colony of Brea: With the 30-year peace treaty, Athens was able to concentrate attention towards growth rather than war. From 447-445, the Delian League was able to influence city-states near the Mediterranean to join and pay tribute (phoro). This helped the region because the tributes paid by each and every city-state were reduced with the increasing number of members joining the league.

'''441'''—The Samian Revolt—Athens decided to besiege [[Samos]] after their revolt in 441. However, Persia decided to take the opportunity to support Samos even though they have signed the Peace of Callias with Athens. Athens would eventually spend 1200 talents to fund the war through the Delian League's treasury. Some scholars believed that Sparta might have aided Samos as well, but decided to pull out, having they signed the Thirty-year peace treaty.

'''437'''—The Foundation of Amphipolis: With vast resources, especially timber for ship building, Athens founded the city of [[Amphipolis]] on the Strymon River. Amphipolis was immensely important to Athens since it controlled many trading routes.

'''432'''—The Potidaean Affair: Athens was threatened by the possibility of a revolt, plotted by Corinth and [[Macedon]]. After fighting in Macedon, which ended when the two countries came to terms with each other, Athens came to Potidaea. They had previously demanded that Potidaea tear down their long walls and banish Corinth ambassadors. However, by the time Athens reached Potidaea, the residents were in full revolt and prepared to fight Athens with support from the Corinthian army. The Corinthians was also able to influence the Spartans to join the cause, since Sparta didn't want to lose such an affluent ally. The fighting concluded with an Athenian victory. 

'''432'''—The Megarian Decree: With Sparta's aid, Megara urged Athens to drop their decree against them since it was hurting their economy; they were forbidden to use Athen's markets and harbors. Athens claims that Megarians insulted them by trespassing on land sacred to [[Demeter]] and murdering an Athenian ambassador. However, most scholars believe it was an act of vengeance when Megara revolted during the early parts of the Pentecontaetia.

'''432'''—Peloponnesian War—This marked the end of the Pentecontaetia, as Athens and Sparta engaged in all-out war, which eventually led to the demise of the Athenian Empire.

=== Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia ===
After the exile of Cimon in Athens, his rivals [[Ephialtes]] and Pericles implemented democratic social reforms. In 462, Ephialtes challenged the [[Areopagus]], claiming that they were abusing their powers. Part of the reform was to introduce "[[graphe paranomon]]" or public protest against illegal decrees. Any citizen would have the right to challenge a previous degree instilled by the Areopagus and claim it as invalid. The assembly would have to conduct a "dokimasia" or examination of state officials before they enter office. Opportunities for citizens to join the office were increased tremendously when 500 members were added. Transferring the powers of the Areopagus to all Athenian citizens enabled a more democratic society. 

These democratic ideals are reflected in the use of personal names without a [[Patronymic]] on inscriptions of casualty lists from around this time, such as those of the tribe [[Erechtheis]] dated to 460/459BC &lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and the Argive dead at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 111&lt;/ref&gt;. Without the [[Patronymic]] or demotic it would have been impossible to identify the particular individual being referred to when multiplicity of the same name occurred, thus both reducing the impact of the long list and ensuring that individuals are deprived of their social context.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 p 61&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ephialtes death, his younger partner Pericles continued with reforms, transforming Athens into the most democratic city-state of Ancient Greece. During 450, he implemented a state salary of two obols per day for jurors to increase public participation from citizens. However, this system caused an outrage from the elites, claiming that the poor were uneducated and incapable of governing.

=== Increasing Tensions Leading to War ===
[[Thucydides]] offers us a unique perspective to view the [[Peloponnesian War]] since he actually took part in the conflict. This first-hand experience allows a look into the mind of a person at the center of the ordeal. The conflict between Athens and Sparta is in Thucydides’ eyes an inevitable confrontation of the two major powers. The beginning of this tension begins during the incipient stages of the Athenian empire following the defeat of Persia during a period called the “pentekontaetia”. The pentekontaetia began in 479 and ended with the outbreak of war. With great confidence in their military abilities, perhaps a bit of instilled machoism, and the need for an anti-Persian alliance, Athens begins recruiting various Greek city-states into an alliance called the [[Delian League]]. The growth of Athenian power through the [[Delian League]] is centered on a growing navy, the rebuilding of the walls that protect the city from land-based attackers, and an aggressive push to extend their influence which included a few skirmishes with other powers. [[Thucydides]] writes about how this period of growth was an inevitable cause of war, “Their supremacy grew during the interval between the present war and the Persian wars, through their military and political actions recounted below against the barbarians, against their own allies in revolt, and against the Peloponnesians whom they encountered on various occasions.” (1.97 [2])

Athenian naval supremacy was a great fear of [[Sparta]] and her allies. While the Spartans combat prowess was unmatched on land, when it came to the sea [[Athens]] was the clear victor. This split seemed to have already been accepted by the Spartans many years earlier, however the aggressiveness and effectiveness of Athenian naval warfare had yet to be fully realized. According to [[Thucydides]] following the defeat of [[Persia]], Athens begins to reconstruct the long walls which connected the main city of Athens to the port of [[Piraeus]] around 478.  “Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards [[Athens]] on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle with Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause them secret annoyance.” (1.92 [1]) The Spartan annoyance stems partly from the long walls being a major deterrent to land based, non-siege tactics which the Spartans were particularly adept at, but also from the way in which the deal was brokered.

[[Thucydides]] writes of [[Themistocles]], an envoy to [[Sparta]], who in 479 changed the tide of history by hiding the facts regarding the construction of the walls around [[Athens]] and those of the [[Piraeus]]. In Themistocles’speech to the Spartan assembly Thucydides points out that at this point Athenian independence was highlighted. “Wherever they had deliberated with the Spartans, they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to none.” (1.91 [5]) This is an important step because Themistocles articulates that Athens is an independent state with its own agenda that brushed over that of others. This is a very important point in the lead up to the [[Peloponnesian War]] because one man is credited with making the split. [[Themistocles]] through his cunningness asserts an independent and strong Athenian identity. He makes it clear after the walls have been secured (ensuring Athenian strength) that Athens is independent and is making self-interested decisions. Furthermore, [[Themistocles]] also predicts that the growth in Athenian power will be centered on the sea. “For he first ventured to tell them to stick to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire.” (1.93 [5]) [[Thucydides]] credits [[Themistocles]] with the determining point in which Athens becomes an empire creating the divide between [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]].

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

Egalitarian and communist-like hunter gatherer societies have been studied and described by many well-known social anthropologists including James Woodburn,&lt;ref&gt;James Woodburn (1982).

Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; offer theoretical accounts to explain how communistic, assertively egalitarian social arrangements might have emerged in the [[prehistory|prehistoric past]]. Despite differences in emphasis, these and other anthropologists follow Engels in arguing that evolutionary change—resistance to primate-style sexual and political dominance—culminated eventually in a revolutionary transition. [[Richard Borshay Lee]] criticizes the mainstream and [[dominant culture]]'s long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding "[[Bourgeois]] ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist. In popular consciousness it is lumped with romanticism, exoticism: the noble savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= ''Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

* '''16,000 years before present''': In the 20th century it was generally believed that humans has crossed a land bridge from [[Eurasia]] perhaps 12,000 years ago &amp;mdash; the 'Clovis First / Single origin hypothesis' &amp;mdash; but modern scientific belief is that settlers arrived by boat at least 14,000-16,000 years before present.

The Greenland colony lasted until the 15th century, but the settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] is the only known [[Norsemen|Norse]] villages in North America outside of Greenland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">[[Image:USICOMOS Exchange.png|right]]The '''US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program''' is an exchange program for young professions in [[historic preservation]] through the United States National Committee of the [[ICOMOS|International Council on Monuments and Sites]]. The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of [[international preservation]] policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/usicomos/International_Exchange_Program/USICOMOS_International_Exchange_Program.htm US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Overview ==
The program began with a one-time exchange between [[US/ICOMOS]] and [[ICOMOS United Kingdom]]. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1–3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year.

Interns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program.

The program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.

== Intern Qualifications ==
Interns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26241">'''Whig history''' (or '''Whig historiography''') is an approach to [[historiography]] that presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater [[liberty]] and [[wikt:enlightenment|enlightenment]], culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].

In general, Whig historians emphasize the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]]. The term is often applied generally (and [[pejoratively]]) to histories that present the past as the inexorable march of [[Progress (history)|progress]] towards enlightenment. The term is also used extensively in the [[history of science]] to mean historiography that focuses on the successful chain of theories and experiments that led to present-day science, while ignoring failed theories and dead ends.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr, "When is Historiography Whiggish?" in ''Journal of the History of Ideas,'' April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301–309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whig history is a form of [[liberalism]], putting its faith in the power of human reason to reshape society for the better, regardless of past history and tradition. It proposes the inevitable progress of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=Conscience and Community: Revisiting Toleration and Religious Dissent in Early Modern England and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19vkEZyd_voC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2010|publisher=Penn State  Press|page=20|isbn=978-0271041377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The British historian [[Herbert Butterfield]] coined the term "Whig history" in his short but influential book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' (1931). It takes its name from the British [[Whiggism|Whigs]], advocates of the power of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], who opposed the [[Tory|Tories]], advocates of the power of the king.

The term has been applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative: in a non-British, more general context, 'whig history' (lower-case) is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;J Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Penguin 2009) p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abstract noun]] "whiggishness" is sometimes used as a generic term for Whig historiography.

Whig history has no direct relation to either the [[British Whig Party|British Whig]] or [[Whig Party (United States)|American Whig]] parties and should not be confused with "[[Whiggism]]", which is a political ideology. The term "[[Whig (disambiguation)|Whiggery]]" is ambiguous in contemporary usage: it may either mean party politics and ideology, or a general intellectual approach.

== Butterfield's intervention ==
When [[H. A. L. Fisher]] in 1928 gave a Raleigh lecture on ''The Whig Historians, from [[Sir James Mackintosh]] to [[George Macaulay Trevelyan|Sir George Trevelyan]]'', he implied that "Whig historian" was adequately taken as a political rather than a progressive or teleological label and this put the concept into play.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bentley, ''Modernizing England's Past: English Historiography in the Age of Modernism'' (2005), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; P. B. M. Blaas, author of the book ''Continuity and Anachronism'', has argued that Whig history itself had lost all vitality by 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield's book on the Whig interpretation marked the emergence of a negative concept in historiography under a convenient phrase, but was not isolated. Undermining whiggish narratives was one aspect of the post–World War I re-evaluation of [[European history]] in general and Butterfield's critique exemplified this trend. Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal. According to Victor Feske, there is too much readiness to accept Butterfield's classic formulation from 1931 as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;''From Belloc to Churchill: Private Scholars, Public Culture, and the Crisis of British Liberalism, 1900–1939'' (1996), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Keith Sewell, ''Herbert Butterfield and the Interpretation of History'', was published in 2005.

=== Butterfield's formulation ===
The characteristics of Whig history as defined by Butterfield include interpreting history as a story of progress toward the present and specifically toward the [[British constitution]]al settlement. Butterfield wrote:{{quote|It is part and parcel of the whig interpretation of history that it studies the past with reference to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Butterfield|title=The Whig Interpretation of History|year=1931|chapter=2. The Underlying Assumption|chapter-url=http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/900/butterfield/chap_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Typical distortions thereby introduced are:
* Viewing the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]ary, [[constitutional monarchy]] as the apex of human political development;
* Assuming that the constitutional monarchy was in fact an ideal held throughout all ages of the past, despite the observed facts of British history and the several power struggles between monarchs and parliaments;
* Assuming that political figures in the past held current political beliefs ([[anachronism]]);
* Assuming that British history was a march of progress whose inevitable outcome was the constitutional monarchy; and
* Presenting political figures of the past as heroes who advanced the cause of this political progress, or villains who sought to hinder its inevitable triumph.&lt;ref&gt;''According to its critics, a Whig interpretation requires human heroes and villains in the story.'' J. Hart, ''Nineteenth-Century Social Reform: A Tory Interpretation of History'', Past &amp; Present 1965 31(1):39–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield argued that this approach to history compromised the work of the historian in several ways. The emphasis on the inevitability of progress leads to the mistaken belief that the progressive sequence of events becomes "a line of [[causation (sociology)|causation]]", tempting the historian to go no further to investigate the causes of historical change.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Butterfield, ''The Whig Interpretation of History'', (New York: W. W. Norton), 1965, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the present as the goal of historical change leads the historian to a special kind of abridgement, selecting only those events that seem important from the present point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield's antidote to Whig history was "to evoke a certain sensibility towards the past, the sensibility which studies the past 'for the sake of the past', which delights in the concrete and the complex, which 'goes out to meet the past', which searches for 'unlikenesses between past and present'".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Wilson and T. G. Ashplant, "Whig History and Present-Centred History," ''The Historical Journal'', 31 (1988): 1–16, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later however - if under wartime pressure - Butterfield would note of the Whig interpretation that "Whatever it may have done to our history, it has had a wonderful effect on our politics....In every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart-strings".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Pengion 2009) p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent views ===
Butterfield's formulation has subsequently received much attention and the kind of historical writing he argued against in generalized terms is no longer academically respectable. Despite its polemical success, Butterfield's celebrated book itself has been criticized by [[David Cannadine]] as "slight, confused, repetitive and superficial".&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'' (1992), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Bentley (historian)|Michael Bentley]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bentley, ''Modern Historiography: An Introduction'' (1999), pp. 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the "Whig theory" according to Butterfield as equivalent to the formation of a canon of 19th-century historians of England (such as [[William Stubbs]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[E. A. Freeman]], [[J. R. Green]], [[W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Lord Acton]], [[J. R. Seeley]], [[S. R. Gardiner]], [[C. H. Firth]] and [[J. B. Bury]]) that in fact excludes few except [[Thomas Carlyle]]. The theory identifies the common factors and Bentley comments: &lt;blockquote&gt;Carlyle apart, the so-called Whigs were predominantly [[Christian]], predominantly [[Anglican]], thinkers for whom the [[Reformation]] supplied the critical theatre of enquiry when considering the origins of modern England. When they wrote about the history of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|English constitution]], as so many of them did, they approached their story from the standpoint of having [[Good News (Christianity)|Good News]] to relate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Scruton]], in his ''A Dictionary of Political Thought'' (1982), takes the theory underlying "Whig history" to be centrally concerned with [[social progress]] and [[Reactionary|reaction]], with the progressives shown as victors and benefactors. Of the English tradition, Cannadine wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''G. M. Trevelyan'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It was fiercely partisan and righteously judgemental, dividing the personnel of the past into the good and the bad. And it did so on the basis of the marked preference for [[Liberalism|liberal]] and progressive causes, rather than [[conservative]] and reactionary ones. [...] Whig history was, in short, an extremely biased view of the past: eager to hand out moral judgements, and distorted by teleology, anachronism and present-mindedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== British Whig historians ==
[[Paul de Rapin|Paul Rapin de Thoyras]]'s history of England, published in 1723, became "the classic Whig history" for the first half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', ''Lord Macaulay's History of England'' (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapin claimed that the English had preserved their [[ancient constitution]] against the absolutist tendencies of the [[Stuarts]]. However, Rapin's history lost its place as the standard history of England in the late 18th century and early 19th century to that of [[David Hume]].

=== David Hume ===
In ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' (1754–1761), Hume challenged Whig views of the past and the Whig historians in turn attacked Hume; but they could not dent his history. In the early 19th century, some Whig historians came to incorporate Hume's views, dominant for the previous fifty years. These historians were members of the ''New Whigs'' around [[Charles James Fox]] (1749–1806) and [[Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] (1773–1840) in opposition until 1830 and so "needed a new historical philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox himself intended to write a history of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, but only managed the first year of [[James II of England|James II]]'s reign. A fragment was published in 1808. [[James Mackintosh]] then sought to write a Whig history of the Glorious Revolution, published in 1834 as the ''History of the Revolution in England in 1688''. [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1765–1769) and [[Henry Hallam]]'s ''Constitutional History of England'' (1827) reveal many Whiggish traits. According to [[Arthur Marwick]], Hallam was the first Whig historian.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of History'' (second edition 1980), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Babington Macaulay ===
Hume still dominated English historiography, but this changed when [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]], utilising Fox and Mackintosh's work and manuscript collections, published the first volumes of his ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'' in 1848. It proved an immediate success, replacing Hume's history and becoming the new orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, pp. 25–6.&lt;/ref&gt; While Macaulay was a popular and celebrated historian of the Whig school, his work did not feature in Butterfield's 1931 book. According to Ernst Breisach, "his style captivated the public as did his good sense of the past and firm Whiggish convictions".&lt;ref&gt;''Historiography'' (second edition, 1994), p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter of Macaulay's ''History of England'' proposes:

{{quote|I shall relate how the new settlement was, during many troubled years, successfully defended against foreign and domestic enemies; how, under that settlement, the authority of law and the security of property were found to be compatible with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never before known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom, sprang a prosperity of which the annals of human affairs had furnished no example; how our country, from a state of ignominious [[vassalage]], rapidly rose to the place of umpire among European powers; how her opulence and her martial glory grew together; how, by wise and resolute good faith, was gradually established a public credit fruitful of marvels which to the statesmen of any former age would have seemed incredible; how a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power, compared with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks into insignificance; how Scotland, after ages of enmity, was at length united to England, not merely by legal bonds, but by indissoluble ties of interest and affection; how, in America, the [[British colonies]] rapidly became far mightier and wealthier than the realms which [[Hernán Cortés|Cortes]] and [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] had added to the dominions of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; how in Asia, British adventurers founded an empire not less splendid and more durable than that of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].

... [T]he history of our country during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.}}

=== William Stubbs ===
[[William Stubbs]] (1825–1901), the constitutional historian and influential teacher of a generation of historians, became a crucial figure in the later survival and respectability of Whig history. According to Reba Soffer: "His rhetorical gifts often concealed his combination of High Church Anglicanism, Whig history, and civic responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, ''Discipline and Power: The University, History, and the Making of an English Elite'' (1994), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of education ===
Political history was the usual venue for Whig history, but it also appears in other areas.  [[Robert Hebert Quick]] (1831–1891) and G. A. N. Lowndes were the leaders of the Whig school of the history of education. In 1898, Quick explained the value of studying the history of educational reform, arguing that the great accomplishments of the past were cumulative and comprised the building blocks that “would raise us to a higher standing-point from which we may see much that will make the right road clearer to us”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gary McCulloch, ''The Struggle for the History of Education'' (Routledge, 2011), p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other examples ==
=== In Canada ===
For Canada, Allan Greer argues:
{{quote|The interpretive schemes that dominated Canadian historical writing through the middle decades of the twentieth century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on the wrong track. They lost because they ''had'' to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Greer, "1837-38: Rebellion reconsidered" ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1995) 76#1 pp 1-18, quotation on page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== In the history of science ===
It has been argued that the [[historiography of science]] is "riddled with Whiggish history".&lt;ref&gt;C. T. McIntire, ''Herbert Butterfield: Historian as Dissenter'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Whig histories, Whig history of science tends to divide historical actors into "good guys" who are on the side of truth (as is now known), and "bad guys" who opposed the emergence of these truths because of ignorance or bias.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Schuster,"The Problem of Whig History in the History of Science, Chap 3 of The Scientific Revolution: Introduction to History and Philosophy of Science [http://descartes-agonistes.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=38&amp;Itemid=53]&lt;/ref&gt; From this Whiggish perspective, [[Ptolemy]] would be criticized because his astronomical system placed the Earth at the center of the universe while [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] would be praised because he placed the Sun at the center of the solar system. This kind of evaluation ignores historical background and the evidence that was available at a particular time: did Aristarchus have evidence to support his idea that the Sun was at the center? Were there good reasons to reject Ptolemy's system before the sixteenth century?

The writing of Whig history of science is especially found in the writings of scientists&lt;ref&gt;"The conventional stories of the past that appear in the introductory chapters of science textbooks are certainly a form of Whiggism.  Historians take great delight in exposing the artificially constructed nature of these stories, and some scientists find the results uncomfortable."  Peter J. Bowler and Iwan Rhys Morus, ''Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 2005) {{ISBN|0-226-06861-7}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and general historians,&lt;ref&gt;"the history of science – as composed by both ex-scientists and general historians – has largely consisted of Whig history, in which the scientific winners write the account in such a way as to make their triumph an inevitable outcome of the righteous logic of their cause." Ken Alder, "The History of Science, or, an Oxymoronic Theory of Relativistic Objectivity", pp. 297–318 in Lloyd Kramer and Sarah Maza, ed., ''A Companion to Western Historical Thought'', (Blackwell,), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; while this whiggish tendency is commonly opposed by professional historians of science. [[Nicholas Jardine]] describes the changing attitude to whiggishness this way:&lt;ref&gt;Nick Jardine, "Whigs and Stories: Herbert Butterfield and the Historiography of Science," .[http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jardine-whigs.pdf ''History of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612060629/http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jardine-whigs.pdf |date=2007-06-12 }}, 41 (2003): 125–140, at pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the mid-1970s, it had become commonplace among historians of science to employ the terms 'Whig' and 'Whiggish', often accompanied by one or more of 'hagiographic', 'internalist', 'triumphalist', even 'positivist', to denigrate grand narratives of scientific progress. At one level there is, indeed, an obvious parallel with the attacks on Whig constitutional history in the opening decades of the century. For, as P. B. M. Blaas has shown, those earlier attacks were part and parcel of a more general onslaught in the name of an autonomous, professional and scientific history, on popular, partisan and moralising historiography. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;...  For post-WWII champions of the newly professionalized history of science the targets were quite different. Above all, they were out to establish a critical distance between the history of science and the teaching and promotion of the sciences. In particular, they were suspicious of the grand celebratory and didactic narratives of scientific discovery and progress that had proliferated in the inter-war years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, some scholars have argued that Whig history is essential to the history of science. At one level, "the very term 'the history of science' has itself profoundly Whiggish implications. One may be reasonably clear what 'science' means in the 19th century and most of the 18th century. In the 17th century 'science' has very different meaning. For example chemistry is inextricably mixed up with alchemy. Before the 17th century dissecting out such a thing as 'science' in anything like the modern sense of the term involves profound distortions".&lt;ref&gt;R. Anthony Hyman, [http://www.projects.ex.ac.uk/babbage/whiggism.html "Whiggism in the History of Science and the Study of the Life and Work of Charles Babbage"]&lt;/ref&gt; The science historians' rejection of whiggishness has been criticized by some scientists for failing to appreciate the temporal depth of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Harrison, "Whigs, prigs and historians of science", ''Nature,'' 329 (1987): 213–14. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v329/n6136/abs/329213a0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As teleology ===
In ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' (1986, see [[anthropic principle]] for details), [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] identify Whiggishness (Whiggery) with a [[teleological]] principle of convergence in history to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986|pages=9–11, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
Despite their shortcomings as interpretations of the past, Whiggish histories continue to influence popular understandings of political and social development. This persistence reflects the power of dramatic narratives that detail epic struggles for enlightened ideals. Aspects of the Whig interpretation are apparent in films, television, political rhetoric and even history textbooks:&lt;ref&gt;James A. Hijiya, "Why the West is Lost", ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd Ser., Vol. 51, No. 2. (Apr., 1994), pp. 276–292.&lt;/ref&gt; thus in the debate over Britishness, for example, [[David Marquand]] praised the Whig approach on the grounds that "Ordered freedom and evolutionary progress ''have'' been among the hallmarks of modern British history, and they ''should'' command respect".&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, in A Gamble ed., ''Britishness'' (Oxford 2009) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular understandings of [[human evolution]] and [[paleoanthropology]] may be imbued with a form of "whiggishness". See for example the celebrated scientific illustration, ''[[March of Progress (illustration)|The March of Progress]]'' (1965). Most portrayals and fictionalized adaptations of the [[Scopes Trial]], such as in ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1955), subscribe to a Whig view of the trial and its aftermath. This was challenged by historian [[Edward J. Larson]] in his book ''Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion'' (1997), for which he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald P. Ladouceur, "Ella Thea Smith and the Lost History of American High School Biology Textbooks", ''Journal of the History of Biology'', Vol. 41, No. 3 (September 2008), pp. 435–471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples addressing moral progress include [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' and [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[The Moral Arc]]''. Both argue that the modern world is much more moral. Pinker is criticized for collapsing distinctions and misrepresenting humanity's past by [[Douglas P. Fry]] and [[R. Brian Ferguson]] in ''War, Peace and Human Nature''; and [[Darcia Narvaez]] points out the opposite trajectory in ''Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom''.

'''Women Who Rock''' was created in 2011 to establish an open dialogue about the portrayal of women and popular music by looking at the effects of society, culture and social justice. This community is brought together in the local Seattle area by [[University of Washington]] and [[Seattle University]] faculty members, students, community members, activists and academics in music history, gender, race and cultural/ social justice movements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "WOMEN WHO ROCK." Women Who Rock Oral History Archive. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variety of individuals from this community are able to introduce and collaborate with artists, musicians, media channels, activists, scholars and students in order to research, discuss and understand the role of women and popular music throughout social scenes and movements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

This forum serves as a way to connect the music community and give light to artists who have been lost to time. This community discusses the underlying social constraints that pave the way for some artists while limiting others. They also try to outline the roots of each sound in popular music and try to give its source recognition.
The University of Washington Libraries Digital Initiatives has hosted the Women Who Rock Digital Oral History Archive since April 2013. The University of Washington works with the Women Who Rock collective by supporting their digital archive and instituting classes on the Seattle campus that represent their ideals. They continue to grow their digital network and data through documentation of scenes collected at their events.
The Women Who Rock collective hosts concerts, interviews, and conferences. They hold an annual unConference &amp; Film Festival that includes music, dance, art and media. They have had notable performers such as [[Alice Bag]], Medusa, Star Evelyn Harris and Christa Bell were featured at their events.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "Women Who Rock Community." Women Who Rock. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, 14 Jan. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building communities ==
The Women Who Rock Archive is based on community outreach and involvement. Over the years the program has partnered with local Seattle communities, including students within and outside the University of Washington. The first collaborating students who helped co-found the project included graduate students from the GWSS Department of the University of Washington who were  mentored by Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman, such as: Nicole Robert, Martha González, Rebecca Clark Mane, and Kim Carter Muñoz. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.washington.edu/news/2010/12/08/these-women-rock-in-research-and-in-life&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/poczineproject/docs/women_who_rock_zine_2013&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://womenwhorockcommunity.org/who-we-are&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://simpsoncenter.org/news/2013/02/rock-archive-women-who-rock%E2%80%99s-2013-unconference-film-festival-launches-digital-oral&lt;/ref&gt;. Lulu (Luzviminda) Carpenter, an experienced Seattle organizer and head of [http://2014northwestfolklifefestival.sched.org/event/1nS1SZ9/uzuri-productions-luzviminda-lulu-carpenter Urzuri Productions],  is a main organizer of the Women Who Rock annual unConference.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/building-communities/bioCarpenter_Lulu.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a faculty member at Seattle University Mako Fitts Ward ensured that the unConference bridged with women musician, performers and activists in Seattle's hip scene. Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman co-teach the class known as Rock the Archive: Hip Hop, Indie Rock &amp; New Media, which allows students to study women and African-American involvement in popular music culture.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michelle Habell-Pallán, Angelica Macklin and Sonnet Retman, “Notes on Women Who Rock: Making Scenes, Building Communities: Participatory Research, Community Engagement, and Archival Practice.” NANO (New American Notes Online) special issue, "Digital Humanities, Public Humanities." July 2014. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Assignments include blog posts, video critiques, and musical analysis. Each assignment is aimed at a key theme of the project: write to rock, reel rebels, making scenes and building communities. For example, students were able to gain admission to the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) and learn about the legacy of Seattle hip-hop.&lt;ref&gt;"MOHAI Presents The Legacy of Seattle Hip-Hop." Museum of History and Industry. MOHAI, 25 June 2015. Web. 04 Dec. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The project has successfully built communities both at the undergraduate and graduate level. Graduate Mentor Workshops are also provided  to allow graduate students to present their work in front of a distinguished audience within their respective field and gain critique and feedback.

== Write To Rock ==
Write to Rock is a subunit of the Women Who Rock organization, focusing on the written histories of popular music. It features many music writers ranging from scholars and critics to journalists and bloggers. With music analysis also ranging across a wide spectrum of genres and music cultures, the group’s focuses are to question and criticize previous music histories through a feminist lens, and to re-write these stories in order to include the erased contributions of women and women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "WOMEN WHO ROCK :: Write to Rock." Women Who Rock Oral History Archive. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Write to Rock archive, which also contributes to the Women Who Rock’s Digital Oral Archive, features biographies and interviews with a number of the individuals who participate with the organization as critical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Habell-Pallán, Michelle, Sonnet Retman, Monica De La Torre, and Angelica Macklin. "Women Who Rock Oral History Collection." Women Who Rock Oral History Collection. University of Washington Digital Initiatives, Apr. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals include: [[Daphne Brooks]], [[Sherrie Tucker]], Maylei Blackwell, María Elena Gaitán, and [[Deborah Wong]].

== Reel Rebels ==
The Women Who Rock Archive also features a number of filmmakers and producers who contribute to the archival and recognition of female artists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The archive has worked with numerous filmmakers including Barni Qaasim, Sheila Jackson, and Karen Whitehead. Recently, they featured a screening of Her Aim Is True, a film biography of [[Jini Dellaccio]], a famous rock photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Karen. "Her Aim Is True." Her Aim Is True. Word Press, n.d. Web. 08 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By highlighting media featuring women, the group attempts to promote greater documentation of the achievements made by female artists. In this, they hope to avoid the systemic under-representation of women in music that is historically pervasive. Videos, in the form of oral histories, are one of several methods the Women Who Rock Archive uses to digitally chronicles the stories of female performers, activists, and community leaders. As of 2015 the Women Who Rock Archive  has eleven oral histories, documenting stories by [[Martha Gonzalez (musician)]], Medusa, Onion Carillo and several others.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;Two Women Who Rock media-makers and UW Gender, Women, &amp; Sexuality Studies Phd students, Angelica Macklin and Monica De La Torre worked with UW faculty Michelle Habell-Pallan and Sonnet Retman to design, curate, and produce the digital version of the Women Who Rock Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Who Rock Oral History Archive :: Search the Archive|url = http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/search.html#credits|website = content.lib.washington.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They partnered with UW Libraries Digital Initiative Team Ann Lally, Anne Graham, Angela Rosette-Tavares, and Rinna Rem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Who Rock Oral History Archive :: Search the Archive|url = http://content.lib.washington.edu/wwrweb/search.html#credits|website = content.lib.washington.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Making Scenes ==
The Making Scenes aspect represents the Women Who Rock organization’s outreach into the local community through events. This allows for community collaboration and dialogue about specific performers and bands. One of the main events this organization holds is an annual conference called the Women Who Rock unConference. Since 2011, this conference has been devoted to women, music, and community building. It has featured various performers including Cholo en Cello, Alice Bag, Medusa, [[Nobuko Miyamoto]], and Quetzal Flores. The conference has been digitally documented every year. Women Who Rock has received support from many organizations such as Washington Hall, Hidmo, De Cajón Project, Seattle Fandango Project, Sistah Sinema, Open Hand Reel, 4Culture, Asian Pacific Islander Women &amp; Family Safety Center, B-Girl Media, Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, Green Bodies, Feest.org, Seattle Girls’ School Latina Affinity Group, Social HeARTistry Educators (S.H.E), Storygarden Seattle, Uzuri Productions, and Zenyu. The organization has also received extensive support from the University of Washington (UW) through the UW Diversity Research Institute, the UW Graduate School, Gender, Women, &amp; Sexuality Studies (GWSS), and American Ethnic Studies.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In an article by [[The Stranger (newspaper)|the Stranger]], a weekly alternative arts and culture newspaper, the Women Who Rock unConference in 2012 was compared to the Northwest Women’s Show held in the Centurylink's Events Center near Centurylink Field. The two events were so widely distinct in that the “unConference” promoted conversation about the politics of gender, race, class, and sexuality generated by popular music while the Northwest Women’s Show focused on dieting, Fitness, Fashion, Wine Tasting, and other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;O, Kelly. "Women Who Rock Project vs. Northwest Women's Show." The Stranger. The Stranger, 5 Mar. 2012. Web. 8 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The author pointed out the disparity between the two events and talked about how fulfilling the unConference was and the triviality of the Northwest Women’s Show.
