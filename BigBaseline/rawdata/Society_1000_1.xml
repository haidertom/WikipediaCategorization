'''Angelica Fraser''' (25 January, 1823 – 27 November, 1910) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] social reformer. She was active in arranging bible based education for tailors and "Tailor's Hall" was opened in London. In Edinburgh she founded a [[temperance society]] for tailors and another for working women.

==Life==
Fraser was born in [[Aberdeen]] in 1823. Her mother, Agnes, died when she was eleven and she took a strong interest in religion.  Her father, Alexander, was the [[Lord Provost]] of Aberdeen. Fraser became interested in the education and well-being of tailors.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt; In 1856 she first entered a tailor's workshop to educate them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19080513.2.23.8|title=Papers Past {{!}} &amp;quot;THE TAILORS' FRIEND.&amp;quot; THE IMPRESSIONIST DRESSER. (Dominion, 1908-05-13)|last=Zealand|first=National Library of New|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arranged for volunteers to read from the Bible as the tailors worked. The idea caught on and similar groups of lady readers were established in Belfast, London and Liverpool to read to tailors as they worked. Fraser thought that the tailors would improve their own working conditions if they were better informed and educated and in 1875 they formed the "Edinburgh Tailors' Abstinence Union".&lt;ref name=ody&gt;Kelly, S. (2004-09-23). Fraser, Angelica Patience (1823–1910), social reformer. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 23 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-59507 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 she formed the "Scottish Ladies' Temperance Society". The society intended to open public houses where alcohol would not be served. They identified laundresses, cooks and similar jobs which made women prone to the temptation of drink. The society planned to make them total abstainers.&lt;ref name="MurrayStark2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet Horowitz Murray|author2=Myra Stark|title=The Englishwoman's Review of Social and Industrial Questions: 1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcwBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=27 January 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-41091-3|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser moved to London in 1879 and the following year organised a conference on matters important to tailors. By 1885 monies had been raised to open an institute with a lecture hall and reading room. It was known as "Tailors' Hall". She became known as the tailors' "Florence Nightingale"&lt;ref name="ody" /&gt; or the "Tailor's Friend". In 1906, on the 50th anniversary of her first work with tailors she established an endowment fund to raise £5000 to ensure the continued work at Tailors' Hall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fraser remained a regular visitor to Tailor's Hall until she died at her home in [[London]] in November 1910.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt;

'''Annette Susannah Beveridge (née Akroyd)''' (1842–1929) was a British [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] known for her translation of the ''[[Humayun|Humayun-nama]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Begam Gulbadam|author2=Annette S. Beveridge|title=The history of Humayun = Humayun-nama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|publisher=Begam Gulbadam|pages=249–|id=GGKEY:NDSD0TGDPA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Babur-nama]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=53954|title=Beveridge [née Akroyd], Annette Susannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Annette Akroyd's father William Akroyd was a [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian]] industrialist associated with the establishment of the [[Bedford College, London]] in 1849, where she completed her study in 1863.&lt;ref name="Kopf1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopf|first=David|authorlink=David Kopf|title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1979|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=978-0-691-03125-5|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in India==
[[File:Annette Akroyd.jpg|thumb|Annette Akroyd with the students of Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, 1875.]]
In October 1872 she sailed for [[British India]]. Around 1875 she was involved in a public controversy with [[Keshub Chandra Sen]], an Indian philosopher and social reformer who attempted to incorporate Christian theology within the framework of Hindu thought. Akroyd was shocked by her discussions with him and felt that Sen, who spoke up for women's education in England, was a typical Hindu obscurantist back home in India, trying to keep knowledge from the minds of women.&lt;ref&gt;David Kopf pg. 34-40&lt;/ref&gt; This dispute spilled into the native press and had its impact on the [[Bethune College|Bethune School]]. Akroyd was also dismayed with Sen's associates such as [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]], [[Aghore Nath Gupta]] and [[Gour Govinda Ray]], who were traditionally Hindu in educational background and resisted the education of women.

:"Mr. Sen had a strong prejudice against university education, in fact, against what is generally regarded as high education, of women. He objected to teaching them, for instance, such subjects as Mathematics, Philosophy and Science, whereas the advanced party positively wanted to give their daughters and sisters what is generally regarded as high education. They did not object to their university education and were not disposed to make much difference in point of education between men and women. There was no hope of compromise between two such extreme schools of thought, Accordingly, the radical party proceeded to start a separate female school of their own, called the [[Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya]] for the education of the adult young ladies belonging to their party. The successful manner in which they carried on the work of this school under Miss Akroyd, subsequently Mrs. Beveridge, attracted much public notice and was highly praised by the officers of Government. This school did excellent work for many years and was subsequently conducted under the name of the [[Banga Mahila Vidyalaya]] and was at last amalgamated with the [[Bethune College]] for ladies, to which it furnished some of its most distinguished students."&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Brahmo Samaj" Sastri:1911:p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
Annette Beveridge translated the diaries of the first [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]], the [[Baburnama]], publishing it in four books from 1912 to 1922. She used both Persian and Turki sources.&lt;ref name="Beveridge3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume I|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli01babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume II|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli02babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also translated the biography of the second [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]], [[Humayun]], from Persian into English. The memoir had been written by his sister [[Gulbadan Begum]], whom Beveridge affectionately called "Princess Rosebud".&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Annette Susannah|title=Life and writings of Gulbadan Begam (Lady Rosebody)|date=1898|location=Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewritingsofgu00beve|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begam|first1=Gulbaden|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The history of Humāyūn (Humāyūn-nāma)|date=1902|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhumynhum00bevegoog|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other translated works include ''The key of the hearts of beginners'', 1908.

==Marriage and children==
She married [[Henry Beveridge]] of the [[Indian Civil Service]].&lt;ref name="MacMillan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret MacMillan|title=Women of the Raj: The Mothers, Wives, and Daughters of the Bristish Empire in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xh4m4Ljrn4C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-8129-7639-7|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had two children: a daughter, Annette Jeanie Beveridge (d. 1956), who married [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 "Courtship and marriage", of ''The Life of R. H. Tawney: Socialism and History''  By Lawrence Goldman&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, [[William Beveridge]] (1879–1963), a noted economist who gave his name to [[Beveridge report|the report]] associated with the foundation of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=pe/&gt;

The Beveridges lived at Pitfold, [[Shottermill]], [[Surrey]], England.&lt;ref name=pe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p14226.htm#i142259|title=Henry Beveridge  Genealogy|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-nuclear protests'''  began on a small scale in the U.S. as early as 1946 in response to [[Operation Crossroads]].&lt;ref&gt;Radio Bikini. DVD. Directed by Stone, Robert. Produced by Robert Stone Productions. 1988; New Video Group, 2003. www.imdb.com/title/tt0093817/&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale anti-nuclear protests first emerged in the mid-1950s in Japan in the wake of the March 1954 [[Lucky dragon|Lucky Dragon Incident]]. August 1955 saw the first meeting of the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which had around 3,000 participants from Japan and other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, Robert.

In 1964, Peace Marches which featured "Ban the bomb" placards, were held in several Australian capital cities.&lt;ref name="australia1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="australia2"/&gt;

In 1972, the [[Nuclear disarmament|anti-nuclear weapons]] movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to [[French nuclear testing]] there. Activists, including [[David McTaggart]] from [[Greenpeace]], defied the French government by sailing small vessels into the test zone and interrupting the testing program.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis.

Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the tests; unions refused to load French ships, service French planes, or carry French mail; and consumers boycotted French products. In Fiji, activists formed an Against Testing on [[Mururoa]] organization.&lt;ref name=japanfocus/&gt;

In November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moritorium on uranium mining.  In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;Falk, Jim (1982). ''Gobal Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', pp. 264–5.&lt;/ref&gt; A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium.  In August, another demonstration brought 50,000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, Alice (1992). ''Atomic Australia 1944–1990'', New South Wales University Press, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's largest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985.&lt;ref name="japanfocus"/&gt; The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific.&lt;ref name=japanfocus/&gt;

On Dec 17th 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/12/18/443080.htm|title=Greenpeace raid on Australian nuclear reactor|date=2001-12-18|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to mark one year since the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to [[uranium mining in Australia]]. There were also events in Sydney, and in Melbourne the protest included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are worried about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |title=Australian Rallies Remember Fukushima Disaster |author=Phil Mercer |date=March 11, 2012 |work=VOA News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312194611/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, 15,000 people demonstrated against French plans to locate the first light-water reactor power plant in Bugey. This was the first of a series of mass protests organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France until the massive demonstration at the [[Superphénix]] breeder reactor in Creys-Malvillein in 1977 culminated in violence.&lt;ref name=nelkin&gt;Dorothy Nelkin and Michael Pollak (1982).

In France, between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations.&lt;ref name="marcuse"/&gt;

In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPWR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/01/18/1027267.htm Thousands march in Paris anti-nuclear protest] ''ABC News'', January 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2007 simultaneous protests, organised by ''[[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]]'', were staged in five French towns to protest construction of [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] plants; [[Rennes]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulouse]], [[Lille]], and [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name=NEI&gt;{{cite news

Following the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], around 1,000 people took part in a protest against nuclear power in [[Paris]] on March 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/pres-d-un-millier-de-manifestants-a-paris-demandent-la-sortie-du-nucleaire-20-03-2011-1308974_23.php Près d'un millier de manifestants à Paris demandent la sortie du nucléaire] [[Le Point]], published 2011-03-20, accessed 2011-04-14&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the protests, however, are focused on the closure of the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]], where some 3,800 French and Germans demonstrated on April 8 and April 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2011/04/10/nucleaire-3-800-manifestants-demandent-l-arret-de-la-centrale-de-fessenheim_1505660_3244.html Des milliers de manifestants demandent l'arrêt de la centrale de Fessenheim] [[Le Monde]], published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands staged anti-nuclear protests around France, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl and after Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], demanding reactors be closed. Protesters' demands were focused on getting France to shut its oldest nuclear power station at Fessenheim, which lies in a densely populated part of France, less than two kilometres from Germany and around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Switzerland.&lt;ref name=afp11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-RY6At4kvtH2P31Nk5xiUeIr8mw?docId=CNG.e738123e4ccce6019851c695501ca633.1211 |title=Thousands in France mark Chernobyl with protests  |author=Arnaud Bouvier  |date=Apr 25, 2011  |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2,000 people also protested at the Cattenom nuclear plant, France's second most powerful, in the Mosel region to the northwest of Strasbourg. Protesters in southwestern France staged another demonstration in the form of a mass picnic in front of the Blayais nuclear reactor, also in memory of Chernobyl. In France's northwestern region of Brittany, around 800 people staged a good-humoured march in front of the Brennilis experimental heavy-water atomic plant that was built in the 1960s. It was taken offline in 1985 but its dismantling is still not completed after 25 years.&lt;ref name=afp11/&gt;

Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear campaigners protested in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/columns-us-japan-nuclear-protest-idUSTRE75A0QH20110615 |title=Japan anti-nuclear protesters rally after quake |author=Antoni Slodkowski |date=Jun 15, 2011 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2011, around 5,000 protesters gathered near Fessenheim nuclear power plant, demanding the plant be shut down immediately. Demonstrators from France and Germany came to Fessenheim and formed a human chain along the road. Protesters claim that the plant is vulnerable to flooding and earthquakes. Fessenheim has become a flashpoint in renewed debate over nuclear safety in France after the Fukushima accident.

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name=spieg11/&gt; Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made.&lt;ref name=spieg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,800319,00.html |title=Thousands of Protesters Obstruct Nuclear Waste Transport |author= |date=2011-11-28 |work=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2011, nine Greenpeace activists cut through a fence at the [[Nogent Nuclear Power Plant]]. They scaled the roof of the domed reactor building and unfurled a "Safe Nuclear Doesn't Exist" banner before attracting the attention of security guards. Two activists remained at large for four hours. On the same day, two more campaigners breached the perimeter of the [[Cruas Nuclear Power Plant]], escaping detection for more than 14 hours, while posting videos of their sit-in on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2017034281.html |title= Breaches at N-plants heighten France's debate over reactors |author=Tara Patel |date=December 16, 2011 |work=Seattle Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aquitaine]], the local group [[TchernoBlaye]] continue to protest against the continued operation of the [[Blayais Nuclear Power Plant]].

On the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], organisers of French anti-nuclear demonstrations claim 60,000 supporters formed a human chain 230 kilometres long, stretching from Lyon to Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/03/11/anti-nuclear-demos-across-europe-on-fukushima-anniversary/ |title=Anti-nuclear demos across Europe on Fukushima anniversary |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, police arrested 57 Greenpeace protesters who used a truck to break through security barriers and enter the Fessenheim nuclear power plant in eastern France. The activists hung antinuclear banners, but France’s nuclear safety authority said that the plant’s security had not been compromised. President Hollande has promised to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants immediate closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/france-greenpeace-activists-arrested-in-break-in.html?_r=0  |title=France: Greenpeace Activists Arrested in Break-In |author= |date=March 18, 2014 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen C.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=marcuse/&gt;

In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.&lt;ref name="dw-world" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16FA3F5D0C728CDDAA0894D9484D81 West Germans Clash at Site of A-Plant] ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DC1439F932A35750C0A967948260 Violence Mars West German Protest] ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest anti-nuclear protest was most likely a 1983 nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin which had about 600,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/2007/02/edwards_calls_i.html Blogs for Bush: The White House Of The Blogosphere: Edwards Calls Israel a Threat]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024242/http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/2007/02/edwards_calls_i.html |date=June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1983, nearly 3 million people across western Europe protested nuclear missile deployments and demanded an end to the arms race. The largest turnout of protesters occurred in West Germany when, on a single day, 400,000 people marched in Bonn, 400,000 in Hamburg, 250,000 in Stuttgart, and 100,000 in West Berlin.&lt;ref name="university148"/&gt;

In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police "used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".&lt;ref name="time1986"/&gt;

During a weekend in October 2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in many years and, according to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', it signals a revival of the [[anti-nuclear movement in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589456,00.html The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement] ''Spiegel Online'', 11/10/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589782,00.html Anti-Nuclear Protest Reawakens: Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests] ''Spiegel Online'', 11/11/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sturdee.

A convoy of 350 farm tractors and 50,000 protesters took part in an anti-nuclear rally in Berlin on September 5, 2009.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name="spieg11"/&gt;

==India==
Following the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the former Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A.&amp;nbsp;Gopalakrishnan. The massive [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] is the focus of concern — "931&amp;nbsp;hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000&amp;nbsp;people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields" — and it has attracted many protests. Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/indian-antinuclear-protesters-will-not-be-deterred-20110422-1drcv.html#ixzz1KOlpfMoG |title=Indian anti-nuclear protesters will not be deterred |first=Ben |last=Doherty |date=April 23, 2011  |work=Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned six-reactor nuclear power complex on the plains of Jaitapur, 420&amp;nbsp;km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. During two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fisherman-shot-dead-in-indian-nuke-protest/story-e6frg6so-1226042424159 |title=Fisherman shot dead in Indian nuke protest |author=Amanda Hodge  |date=April 21, 2011   |work=The Australian  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2011, thousands of protesters and villagers living around the Russian-built [[Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant]] in the southern Tamil Nadu province, are blocking highways and staging hunger strikes, preventing further construction work, and demanding its closure as they fear of the disasters like the [[Environmental impact of nuclear power]], [[Radioactive waste]], [[nuclear accident]] similar to the releases of radioactivity in March at Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=nzh11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10762102 |title=Indian activists fear nuclear plant accident |author=Rahul Bedi |date=October 28, 2011 |work=NZ Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme Court. The PIL specifically asks for the "staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies".&lt;ref name=nukeindia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3889&amp;Itemid=614 |title=

In 1982, [[Chugoku Electric Power Company]] proposed building a [[nuclear power plant]] near [[Iwaishima]], but many residents opposed the idea, and the island’s fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders carried out. Since the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/world/asia/28nuclear.html |title=Japanese Island’s Activists Resist Nuclear Industry’s Allure |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=August 27, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research results show that some 95 post-war attempts to site and build nuclear power plants resulted in only 54 completions. Many affected communities "fought back in highly publicized battles". Co-ordinated opposition groups, such as the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center and the anti-nuclear newspaper ''Hangenpatsu Shinbun'' have operated since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=api12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/22213/api103.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Post-crisis nuclear policy |author=[[Daniel P.

Author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1994, and has campaigned for pacifist and [[anti-nuclear]] causes addressed the crowd. Musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], who composed the score to the movie ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' was also among the event's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |author= |date=September 2011 |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama on the weekend of January 14–15, 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand was for the protection of rights for those affected by the Fukushima accident, including basic human rights such as health care, living standards and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20120122a2.html |title=Protesting nuclear power |author= |date=Jan 22, 2012 |work=The Japan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{Further|Nuclear-free zone#New Zealand}}

From the early 1960s New Zealand peace groups [[CND]] and the Peace Media organised nationwide anti-nuclear campaigns in protest of [[Nuclear testing|atmospheric testing]] in [[French Polynesia]]. These included two large national [[petitions]] presented to the New Zealand government which led to a joint [[New Zealand]] and [[Australian]] Government action to take France to the [[International Court of Justice]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124170238/http://www.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/index.html |date=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Greenpeace]] and an amalgam of [[New Zealand]] peace groups managed to delay nuclear tests by several weeks by trespassing with a ship in the testing zone. During the time, the skipper, [[David McTaggart]], was beaten and severely injured by members of the French military.

On 1 July 1972, the Canadian [[ketch]] ''[[Greenpeace#Moruroa Atoll and the Vega|Vega]]'', flying the [[Greenpeace]] III banner, collided with the French naval minesweeper ''La Paimpolaise'' while in [[international waters]] to protest French [[nuclear weapon]] [[Moruroa|tests]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].

In 1973 the New Zealand Peace Media organised an international flotilla of protest yachts including the [[Fri (yacht)|Fri]], Spirit of Peace, Boy Roel, Magic Island and the Tanmure to sail into the test exclusion zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.bullerdc.govt.nz/cgi-bin/library/liinquiry?acc=00000711 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209094841/http://library.bullerdc.govt.nz/cgi-bin/library/liinquiry?acc=00000711 |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Norman Kirk]] as a symbolic act of protest sent two navy frigates, [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS Canterbury]] and [[HMNZS Otago]], to Mururoa.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723050155/http://www.mururoavet.com/] They were accompanied by [[HMAS Supply|HMAS ''Supply'']], a fleet oiler of the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frame |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop) |title=No Pleasure Cruise: the story of the Royal Australian Navy |year=2004 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=Crows Nest |isbn=1-74114-233-4 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the Greenpeace ship ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' was [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombed and sunk]] by the French [[Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure|DGSE]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], as it prepared for another protest of [[nuclear test]]ing in French military zones. One crew member, [[Fernando Pereira]] of [[Portugal]], photographer, drowned on the sinking ship while attempting to recover his photographic equipment. Two members of DGSE were captured and sentenced, but eventually repatriated to France in a controversial affair.

In the Philippines, a focal point for protests in the late 1970s and 1980s was the proposed [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]], which was built but never operated.&lt;ref name=as/&gt;  The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zone.&lt;ref name=as&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yok-shiu F.

==South Korea==
In March 2012, environmental conservation groups staged a rally in central Seoul to voice opposition to nuclear power on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. According to organizers, over 5,000 people attended, and the turnout was one of the biggest in recent memory for an antinuclear demonstration. The rally adopted a declaration demanding that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy to promote nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/international/news/20120311p2g00m0in018000c.html |title=Antinuclear rally held in Seoul on eve of Japan quake anniversary |author= |date=March 11, 2012 |work=Mainichi Daily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719173708/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/international/news/20120311p2g00m0in018000c.html |archivedate=July 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{See also|Anti-nuclear movement in Spain}}

In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects.&lt;ref name=spain&gt;Lutz Mez, [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]] (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 1977, in Bilbao, Spain, between 150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the [[Lemoniz Nuclear Power Plant]]. This has been called the "biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In June 2010, Greenpeace [[anti-nuclear]] activists invaded Forsmark nuclear power plant to protest the then-plan to remove the government prohibition on building new nuclear power plants.  In October 2012, 20 Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter fence of the Ringhals nuclear plant, and there was also an incursion of 50 activists at the Forsmark plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were protests against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it says are unsafe in European stress tests, and to emphasise that stress tests did nothing to prepare against threats from outside the plant. A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that "the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurethe-antis-attack/ |title=The antis attack! |author= |date=5 April 2013 |work=Nuclear Engineering International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the [[Beznau Nuclear Power Plant]], the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9NCL8100.htm |title=Biggest anti-nuclear Swiss protests in 25 years |author= |date=May 22, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Anti-nuclear_protests_attract_20,000.html?cid=30291990 |title=Anti-nuclear protests attract 20,000 |author= |date=May 22, 2011 |work=Swissinfo |page= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ysmk3EoO?url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Anti-nuclear_protests_attract_20,000.html?cid=30291990 |archivedate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=no |df= |access-date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors.

In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's [[Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant|fourth nuclear power plant]]. The protesters were also opposed to lifespan extensions for three existing nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20110320-269104.html |title=Over 2,000 rally against nuclear plants in Taiwan |author= |date=March 20, 2011  |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in [[Taipei City]], which had a carnival-like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and waving sunflowers. This was part of a nationwide "No Nuke Action" protest, against construction of the fourth nuclear plant and in favor of a more [[renewable energy policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/01/2003502115 |title=Anti-nuclear rally draws legions |author=Lee I-Chia |date=May 1, 2011 |work=Taipei Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yLEqVOgb?url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/01/2003502115 |archivedate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[World Environment Day]] in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation’s three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of the fourth plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/06/05/2003505021 |title=Conservationists protest against nuclear policies |author=Lee I-Chia |date=June 5, 2011 |work=Tapai Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island by taking lessons from Japan's disaster on March 11, 2011. They "want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant – the fourth in densely populated Taiwan". Scores of aboriginal protesters "demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their [[Orchid Island]], off south-eastern Taiwan. Authorities have failed to find a substitute storage site amid increased awareness of nuclear danger over the past decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_776471.html |title=About 2,000 Taiwanese stage anti-nuclear protest |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Straits Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, 68,000 Taiwanese protested across major cities against the island’s fourth nuclear power plant, which is under construction. Taiwan’s three existing nuclear plants are near the ocean, and prone to geological fractures, under the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/taiwan-anti-nuclear-protests-may-derail-8-9-billion-power-plant.html |title=Taiwan Anti-Nuclear Protests May Derail $8.9 Billion Power Plant |author=Yu-Huay Sun  |date=Mar 11, 2013   |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] organised by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="cnduk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many significant anti-nuclear mobilizations in the 1980s occurred at the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]]. It began in September 1981 after a [[Wales|Welsh]] group called "Women for Life on Earth" arrived at Greenham to protest against the decision of the Government to allow [[cruise missile]]s to be based there.&lt;ref name="university1"/&gt; The women's peace camp attracted significant media attention and "prompted the creation of other peace camps at more than a dozen sites in Britain and elsewhere in Europe".&lt;ref name="university1" /&gt; In December 1982 some 30,000 women from various peace camps and other peace organisations held a major protest against nuclear weapons on Greenham Common.&lt;ref name="university148" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wit144/&gt;

On 1 April 1983, about 70,000 people linked arms to form a human chain between three nuclear weapons centres in Berkshire. The anti-nuclear demonstration stretched for 14&amp;nbsp;miles along the Kennet Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brown, Shyama Perera and Martin Wainwright.

In London, in October 1983, more than 300,000 people assembled in Hyde Park. This was "the largest protest against nuclear weapons in British history", according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="university148" /&gt;

In 2005 in Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging [[UK Trident programme|Trident weapons system]] with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.&lt;ref name="thebulletin"/&gt;

In October 2008 in the United Kingdom, more than 30 people were arrested during one of the largest anti-nuclear protests at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] at Aldermaston for 10 years. The demonstration marked the start of the UN World Disarmament Week and involved about 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/28/anti-nuclear-aldermaston-protest-disarmament More than 30 arrests at Aldermaston anti-nuclear protest] ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, more than 200 protesters blockaded the [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]] site. Members of several anti-nuclear groups that are part of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in protest at EDF Energy's plans to renew the site with two new reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/03/hinkley-point-protest-nuclear-power |title=Hinkley Point power station blockaded by anti-nuclear protesters |author= |date=3 October 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, three hundred anti-nuclear protestors took to the streets of Llangefnia, against plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa.

On March 10, 2012, the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], hundreds of anti-nuclear campaigners formed a symbolic chain around Hinkley Point to express their determined opposition to new nuclear power plants, and to call on the coalition government to abandon its plan for seven other new nuclear plants across the UK. The human chain continued for 24 hours, with the activists blocking the main Hinkley Point entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html |title=Brits protest against govt. nuclear plans |author= |date=Mar 10, 2012 |work=PressTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413112359/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/231009.html |archivedate=2012-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, thousands of Scottish campaigners, MSPs, and union leaders, rallied against nuclear weapons. The Scrap Trident Coalition wants to see an end to nuclear weapons, and says saved monies should be used for health, education and welfare initiatives. There was also a blockade of the [[Faslane Naval Base]], where Trident missiles are stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-anti-nuclear-protesters-glasgow-march-1828754 |title=Thousands of anti-nuclear protesters attend Glasgow march against Trident  |author= |date=13 April 2013 |work=Daily Record }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 1981, [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] launched the longest running peace [[vigil]] in US history at [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/07/AR2009020701843.html|title=From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=February 8, 2009|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined on the [[White House Peace Vigil]] by anti-nuclear activists [[Concepcion Picciotto]] and [[Ellen Thomas|Ellen Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=Jazeera&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aje.me/HHwQcE |title=The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue |publisher=''Al Jazeera Documentary Channel'' |date=April 17, 2012 |author= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710053132/http://aje.me/HHwQcE |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's [[Central Park]] against [[nuclear weapons]] and for an end to the [[cold war]] [[arms race]]. It was the largest anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|protest]] and the largest political demonstration in American history.&lt;ref name="thenation2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="university145"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icanw1982"/&gt;

Beginning in 1982, an annual series of [[Christian]] peace vigils called the "Lenten Desert Experience" were held over a period of several weeks at a time, at the entrance to the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the USA. This led to a faith-based aspect of the nuclear disarmament movement and the formation of the anti-nuclear [[Nevada Desert Experience]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Butigan|title=Pilgrimage through a Burning World: Spiritual Practice and Nonviolent Protest at the Nevada Test Site|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzZFXx-fvpgC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8650-4|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice]] was located in [[Seneca County, New York]], adjacent to the [[Seneca Army Depot]]. It took place mainly during the summer of 1983. Thousands of women came to participate and rally against nuclear weapons and the "[[patriarchal society]]" that created and used those weapons.  The purpose of the Encampment was to stop the scheduled deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles before their suspected shipment from the Seneca Army Depot to Europe that fall. The Encampment continued as an active political presence in the Finger Lakes area for at least 5 more years.

Hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1986 in what is referred to as the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]].  The march took nine months to traverse {{Convert|3700|mi}}, advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19861116&amp;id=6NARAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5ekDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4346,12809 Hundreds of Marchers Hit Washington in Finale of Nationwide Peace March] ''Gainesville Sun'', November 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-nuclear organisation "Nevada Semipalatinsk" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former [[Soviet Union]].  It attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the [[nuclear test site]] at [[Semipalatinsk]], in north-east [[Kazakhstan]], in 1991.  The Soviet Union conducted over 400 [[nuclear weapons tests]] at the Semipalatinsk Test Site between 1949 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Semipalatinsk: 60 years later (collection of articles) | publisher = ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' | date = September 2009 | url = http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/special-topics/semipalatinsk-60-years-later | accessdate = 2009-10-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014204454/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/special-topics/semipalatinsk-60-years-later | archive-date = 2009-10-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] believes that one million people were exposed to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/288008.stm World: Asia-Pacific: Kazakh anti-nuclear movement celebrates tenth anniversary] ''BBC News'', February 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Chance.

An important part of communicating in a bias-free manner is by making sure you are engaging in meaningful conversations, using bias-free language. Your use of words is vital in terms of effectively communicating in ways that you do not offend the person you are talking to. According to Locker, "Bias-free language is language that is sensitive to people's sex, race, age, physical condition and many other categories. Bias-free language does not discriminate and therefore includes all readers in a fair and friendly manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/CC3BFEEB-C364-E1A1-A5390F221AC0FD2D/bias-free_language.pdf|title=Bias-free Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Part of History of India}}
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}

The '''Cemetery H culture''' was a Bronze Age culture in the [[Punjab region]] of what is now Pakistan and north-western India, from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE. It was a regional form of the late phase of the [[Harappan civilisation|Harappan]] (Indus Valley) civilisation (alongside the [[Jhukar Phase|Jhukar culture]] of Sindh and [[Rangpur, India|Rangpur culture]] of Gujarat).

==Origins==
The Cemetery H culture was located in and around the [[Punjab region]] in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It was named after a cemetery found in "area H" at [[Harappa]]. Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE.

According to Rafique Mughal, the Cemetery H culture developed out of the northern part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 1700 BCE, being part of the Punjab Phase,&lt;ref&gt;M Rafiq Mughal Lahore Museum Bulletin, off Print, vol.III, No.2, Jul-Dec. 1990 [http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_1990_Decline-of-the-Indus_Lahore-Mus-Bulletin.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; one of three cultural phases that developed in the [[Localization Era]] or "Late Harappan phase" of the [[Indus Valley Tradition]].{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991a}}{{sfn|Shaffer|1992}} According to [[Jonathan Mark Kenoyer|Kenoyer]], the Cemetery H culture "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past."{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56}} According to Kennedy and Mallory &amp; Adams, the Cemetery H culture also "shows clear biological affinities" with the earlier population of Harappa.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=312}} {{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310}}

Some traits of the Cemetery H culture have been associated with the [[Swat culture]], which has been regarded as evidence of the Indo-Aryan movement toward the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=103}} According to Parpola, the Cemetery H culture represents a first wave of [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migration]] from as early as 1900 BCE, which was followed by a migration to the Punjab c. 1700-1400 BCE.{{sfn|Parpola|1998}} According to Kochhar, the Swat IV co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000-1800 BCE), while the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat V later absorbed the Cemetery H people and gave rise to the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] (to 1400 BCE).{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

Together with the [[Gandhara grave culture]] and the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]], the Cemetery H culture is considered by some scholars as a factor in the formation of the [[Vedic civilization]].{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185-186}}

==Features==
The distinguishing features of this culture include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030161353/http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_02.html |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of [[cremation]] of human remains. The bones were stored in painted pottery burial urns. This is completely different from the Indus civilization where bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The urn burials and the "grave skeletons" were nearly contemporaneous.{{sfn|Sarkar|1964}}
* Reddish pottery, painted in black with [[antelope]]s, [[peacock]]s etc., [[sun]] or [[star]] motifs, with different surface treatments to the earlier period.
* Expansion of settlements into the east.
* [[Rice]] became a main crop.
* Apparent breakdown of the widespread trade of the Indus civilization, with materials such as marine shells no longer used.
* Continued use of mud brick for building.

Some of the designs painted on the Cemetery H funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of [[historical Vedic religion|Vedic mythology]]: for instance, peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside, which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead, and a hound that can be seen as the hound of [[Yama]], the god of death.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=102}}&lt;ref&gt;Bridget and Raymond Allchin (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan''], p.246&lt;/ref&gt; This may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period, but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Cemetery H people were the destroyers of the Harappan cities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=102-103}}

==Archaeology==
Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture, a practice previously described in the [[Vedas]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers "both cremated (''agnidagdhá-'') and uncremated (''ánagnidagdha-'')" are invoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15669">'''Co-regulation''' (or coregulation) is a term used in psychology, defined most broadly as a "continuous unfolding of individual action that is susceptible to being continuously modified by the continuously changing actions of the partner". An important aspect of this idea is that co-regulation cannot be reduced down to the behaviors or experiences of the individuals involved in the interaction.&lt;ref name = butler&gt;Butler, E. A., &amp; Randall, A. K. (2013). Emotional Coregulation in Close Relationships. Emotion Review, 5(2), 202–210. http://doi.org/10.1177/1754073912451630&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction is a result of each participant repeatedly regulating the behavior of the other. It is a continuous and dynamic process, rather than the exchange of discrete information.&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, A., &amp; Garvey, A. (2007). Alive communication. Infant Behavior and Development, 30(2), 251–257. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2007.02.007&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-regulation is often applied in the context of emotions. In this sense, the emotions of each individual within a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] are constantly in flux, depending on the emotions and behaviors of the partner. If emotion co-regulation is in effect, the result will be a decrease in overall emotional distress. A working definition of emotion co-regulation has been offered as "a bidirectional linkage of oscillating emotional channels between partners, which contributes to emotional stability for both partners".&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Emotion co-regulation is thoroughly studied in the context of early emotional development, often between infants and caregivers. It has also been studied in adult interpersonal interactions, with an emphasis on close, romantic relationships. One important note regarding co-regulation is that there may be an imbalance within the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]], such that one member is more actively regulating the behavior of the other.

The following is an example of co-regulation between a mother and her infant, from ''Emotional Development: The Organization of Emotional Life in the Early Years''. This scenario exemplifies a mother maintaining her infant's engagement via variations in her voice, facial expressions, and body language. She sensitively elicits behaviors from the infant and adds more stimulation when appropriate. Likewise, the infant indicates and maintains the mutual engagement with her own facial expressions, vocalizations, and body language.
{{Quote|Hello there pumpkin ... Mommy's comin' to get you. Yes, she is. [Brief pause.] Momma's gonna get you and tickle you. What do you think of that? [Brief pause.] Come on. Come on, you little sweetie. Let me see that smile. Humm? [Pause.] Yeah, that's right ... thaaaat's right. [The infant exhibits a big smile with bobbing head, and mother responds in kind, then says,] Oh, well now, are you gonna say somethin'? Are ya? [Pause, mother nodding head, widening eyes.] Come on! [Pause.] Come on! [The baby begins cycling movements of the arms and kicking the feet.] Come on. [Drawn out, then longer pause.] Yeah! [as the baby bursts forth with a gurgling sound, the caregiver then laughs and hugs the baby]."&lt;ref name = sroufe/&gt;}}

==Proposed criteria==

Despite a history of studies on co-regulation, researchers have lacked a clear, operational definition of co-regulation. In a review of emotional co-regulation in close relationships, Butler and Randall proposed the following three criteria for determining the presence of co-regulation:&lt;ref name = butler/&gt;
#Bidirectional linkage of emotional channels:
#:Both partners' emotions will influence each other in a recursive pattern of mutual regulation. Critically, this effect will be supported by statistical tests for dependence.
#Morphostatic oscillating emotional channels:
#:The level of emotional arousal within each member will stay within the range of stable, comfortable arousal (mildly negative to fairly positive). If the dyad becomes too emotionally aroused without a subsequent return to emotional calm, this would be a failure to co-regulate. Morphostatic oscillation is in contrast to morphogenic oscillation, which results in an elevated emotional state for one or both partners. Examples of morphogenic oscillation includes emotion contagion, transmission, and negative reciprocity during conflicts. 
#Co-regulation will contribute to emotional and physiological [[allostasis]] for both partners.
#:A close relationship partner (e.g., caregiver, spouse) will be sensitive to one's emotional distress, and mere proximity to that partner will automatically lead to reductions in distress. In contrast, proximity to a stranger when faced with a stressor may also lead to reductions in distress, but it will not manifest in a bidirectional pattern.

==Across the lifespan==

===In childhood===

Co-regulation has been identified as a critical precursor for [[emotional self-regulation]]. Infants have instinctive regulatory behaviors, such as gaze redirection, body re-positioning, self-soothing, distraction, problem solving, and venting,&lt;ref&gt;Leerkes, E. M., &amp; Wong, M. S. (2012). Infant Distress and Regulatory Behaviors Vary as a Function of Attachment Security Regardless of Emotion Context and Maternal Involvement. Infancy, 17(5), 455–478. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00099.x&lt;/ref&gt; but the most effective way for an infant to regulate distress is to seek out help from a caregiver. Sensitive, reliable responses by the caregiver, over time, indicate to the infant that emotional distress is manageable, either with the help of a caregiver, or by strategies developed during past interactions with a caregiver. The strongest theoretical and empirical support for this phenomenon comes from research on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name = bowlby&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). Attachment and loss (Vol 1), 2nd ed. New York: Basic.&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment has even been explicitly defined as "the dyadic regulation of emotion".&lt;ref name=sroufe&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1997). Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise is that early biological and behavioral co-regulation from the caregiver facilitates the child's development of secure attachment which then promotes self-regulation. Drawing from [[John Bowlby]]'s theory of "internal working models", young children develop mental representations of the caregiving relationship, as well as relationships more generally, through repeated interactions with the caregiver. Sensitive and consistent caregiving promotes the development of the expectation that emotional arousal is manageable via eliciting the support of the caregiver (or others) and/or with independent coping. Alternatively, Bowlby hypothesized that infants who experience insensitive and inconsistent caregiving are likely to develop the expectation that emotional needs will not be met by others or the self.&lt;ref name = bowlby/&gt; Furthermore, in studies testing the statistical dependencies between parent and infant behaviors, researchers have found support for contingencies of eye gaze, facial expressions, prosody, speech rhythms, attention, and physiological arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1985). Attachment as psychobiological attunement: Being on the same wavelength. In M. Reite &amp; T. Field (Eds.), The psychobiology of attachment and separation (pp. 415–454). Orlando, FL: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In infancy, co-regulation is primarily initiated and maintained by the caregiver, such that the caregiver is putting forth effort to soothe the child's emotional distress. Caregiver responses are calibrated to closely fit infant responses and elicit the next behavior. This effect has been called "caregiver-guided dyadic regulation".&lt;ref name = sroufe/&gt; Co-regulatory interactions between parents and children become more balanced over time, as children develop emotion regulation strategies of their own. Caregivers of preschoolers, for example, take a more passive co-regulating role. They demonstrate willingness to assist with distress and availability when needed, but not over-involvement. Instead of more actively co-regulating, these parents are more likely than parents of younger children to give their children space to independently regulate, suggest regulation strategies, or facilitate more abstract discussions regarding emotional experiences and appropriate responses.&lt;ref&gt;Blandon, A. Y., Calkins, S. D., Keane, S. P., &amp; O'Brien, M. (2008). Individual differences in trajectories of emotion regulation processes: The effects of maternal depressive symptomatology and children's physiological regulation. Developmental Psychology, 44(4), 1110–1123. http://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1110&lt;/ref&gt;

===In adulthood===
Co-regulation has also been examined in the context of close adult relationships, though less so than in the parent-child context. Research studies conducted thus far provide preliminary support for the phenomenon. Similar to the evidence for co-regulation in childhood, this literature is often rooted in the [[Attachment Theory|attachment]] framework. As such, it works from the hypothesis that early experiences of co-regulation are internalized and guide expectations about and behavior within future close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A., &amp; Fleeson, J. (1986). Attachment and the construction of relationships. In W. Hartup &amp; Z. Rubin (Eds), Relationships in development. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; There, however, are several points of divergence between the child and adult literature on co-regulation. First, co-regulation in adult relationships is defined by reciprocity between partners, such that the responsibility to regulate the other is more or less equally split. Second, research on adult co-regulation is more likely to incorporate physiological measures. Indeed, physiological substrates involved in reward systems (e.g., oxytocin, opioids), are strongly activated by sexual contact, which is an added mechanism through which adults co-regulate. Third, animal models are commonly utilized in studies of co-regulation within adult dyads.&lt;ref&gt;Sbarra, D. A., &amp; Hazan, C. (2008). Coregulation, Dysregulation, Self-Regulation: An Integrative Analysis and Empirical Agenda for Understanding Adult Attachment, Separation, Loss, and Recovery. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 12(2), 141–167. http://doi.org/10.1177/1088868308315702&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these differences, research findings on adult co-regulation thus far seem to extend the parent-child co-regulation findings. So far, researchers have evidence that adult partners' emotions oscillate in a coordinated pattern&lt;ref&gt;Butner, J., Diamond, L. M., &amp; Hicks, A. M. (2007). Attachment style and two forms of affect coregulation between romantic partners. Personal Relationships, 14, 431–455.&lt;/ref&gt; and that presence of one's spouse leads to stress reduction, and even more so for individuals in reportedly high quality marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J. A., Schaefer, H. S., &amp; Davidson, R. J. (2006). Lending a hand: Social regulation of the neural response to threat. Psychological Science, 17, 1032–1039&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==

===Behavioral===
Examples of co-regulating parent behaviors/caregiver-guided dyadic regulation:&lt;ref name = gulsrud&gt;Gulsrud, A. C., Jahromi, L. B., &amp; Kasari, C. (2009). The Co-Regulation of Emotions Between Mothers and their Children with Autism. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 40(2), 227–237. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-009-0861-x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grolnick, W. S., Kurowski, C. O., McMenamy, J. M., Rivkin, I., &amp; Bridges, L. J. (1998). Mothers' strategies for regulating their toddlers' distress. Infant Behavior and Development, 21(3), 437–450. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0163-6383(98)90018-2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prompting/helping: Mother physically or vocally prompts and scaffolds child (e.g., physical prompting with toy if child becomes frustrated) 
* Following the child's lead: Mother is sensitive to child's interests and follows the child to his/her desired toy/activity (e.g., Mom may appear to wait for child to choose a toy and then insert herself into interaction) 
* Redirection of attention: Mother distracts the child or directs the child's attention away from negative stimulus (e.g., pointing out other toys in room) 
* Active ignoring: Mother actively ignores child during distress episodes (e.g., mom may continue to play with a toy or purposely turn away from child) 
* Reassurance: Mother reassures or encourages child surrounding frustrating or negative activity (e.g., ''It's okay. You can do it!'') 
* Emotional following: Mother's reflection, extension or elaboration upon child's distress or preoccupation (e.g., ''I know you want the toy'') 
* Physical comfort: Mother initiates behaviors to comfort child (e.g., hugging, kissing, picking up the child, rocking) 
* Vocal comfort: Mother initiates vocalizations to comfort the child (e.g., sshhing, singing, sing-song voice)

===Biological===
Inclusion of physiological measurements of co-regulation is a relatively recent innovation in the psychological research. The underlying premise is that, similar to observable indicators of co-regulation, co-regulating partners' physiology will be bidirectionally linked and subsequently stabilized. Some of these biological measures may be more effective research tools than others. More rapidly fluctuating indices, such as autonomic responses, for example, are proposed to be more temporally sensitive measures of biological co-regulation.&lt;ref name = butler/&gt;
* Activity of the [[autonomic nervous system]]
* [[Cortisol]]
* [[Oxytocin]]
* [[Vagal tone]]

==In autism spectrum disorder (ASD)==
{{main article|Autism spectrum}}
As co-regulation is contingent on reciprocal relationships between members of a dyad, it can be compromised by risk factors within the individuals. As such, a newer line of research has identified children on the [[autism spectrum]] as a risk group for disruptions in co-regulation in their parent-child dyads. In the [[DSM-5]], the first diagnostic criterion of ASD is "Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts"&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5®). American Psychiatric Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, disruptions with co-regulation are inherent in the disorder, in that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in social-emotional reciprocity and sharing of emotions. Although only a handful of studies have directly examined co-regulation in parent-child with ASD dyads, converging evidence has demonstrated that parents' immediate responses to emotional distress facilitates self-regulation for children with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschler-Guttenberg, Y., Feldman, R., Ostfeld-Etzion, S., Laor, N., &amp; Golan, O. (2015). Self- and Co-regulation of Anger and Fear in Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Role of Maternal Parenting Style and Temperament. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45(9), 3004–3014. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-015-2464-z&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly interesting finding was that, while mothers of typically developing children transition to more passive co-regulation over toddlerhood, as their children become more independent self-regulators, mothers of children with ASD continued to use active co-regulation strategies throughout the duration of the study. The authors conjectured that this continuation was a reflection of the mothers' sensitivity to their children's heightened developmental needs.&lt;ref name = gulsrud/&gt;

;Europe
Human history has experienced numerous episodes of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;David Nirenberg, Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medieval Europe, Protestants clashed with Catholics, Christians clashed with Muslims while both perpetuated violence against Jews and [[Romani people|Roma]] minorities. In 1561, [[Huguenot]]s in Toulouse took out in a procession through the streets to express their solidarity for Protestant ideas. A few days later, the Catholics hunted down some of the leaders of the procession, beat them and burned them at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Jean Souriac]], "Du corps à corps au combat fictif. Quand les catholiques toulousains affrontaient leurs homologues protestants," in Les affrontements: Usages, discours et rituels, Editor: Frédérique Pitou and Jacqueline Sainclivier, Presses Universitaires de Rennes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the French town of Pamiers, communal clashes were routine between Protestants and Catholics, such as during holy celebrations where the Catholics took out a procession with a statue of St. Anthony, sang and danced while they carried the statue around town. Local Protestants would year after year disrupt the festivities by throwing stones at the Catholics. In 1566, when the Catholic procession reached a Protestant neighborhood, the Protestants chanted "kill, kill, kill !!" and days of communal violence with numerous fatalities followed.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruff, Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500–1800, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1572, thousands of Protestants were killed by Catholics during communal violence in each of the following cities – Paris, Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyon, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partner, P. 1999"/&gt; In Switzerland, communal violence between the Reformation movement and Catholics marked the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gordon (2002), The Swiss Reformation, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719051180}}, pp. 90–99&lt;/ref&gt;

;Africa
The Horn of Africa as well as West African regions have similar history of communal violence.

East, South and Southeast Asia have recorded numerous instances of communal violence. For example, Singapore suffered a wave of communal violence in 20th century between Malays and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Leifer, Michael (1964), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642213 Communal violence in Singapore], Asian Survey, Vol. 4, No. 10 (Oct., 1964), 1115–1121&lt;/ref&gt; In Indian subcontinent, numerous 18th through 20th century records of the British colonial era mention communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, as well as Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, particularly during processions related to respective religious celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Bayly, C.

The frequency of communal violence in South Asia increased after the first partition of Bengal in 1905, where segregation, unequal political and economic rights were imposed on Hindus and Muslims by Lord Curzon, based on religion. The colonial rule was viewed by each side as favoring the other side, resulting in a wave of communal riots and 1911 reversal of Bengal partition and its re-unification.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P.

==National laws==

===India===
The Indian law defines communal violence as, "any act or series of acts, whether spontaneous or planned, resulting in injury or harm to the person and or property, knowingly directed against any person by virtue of his or her membership of any religious or linguistic minority, in any State in the Union of India, or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of clauses (24) and (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf PREVENTION OF COMMUNAL AND TARGETED VIOLENCE (ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND REPARATIONS) BILL, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814185325/http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf |date=2014-08-14 }} Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, communal violence is defined as that is driven by a sense of religious, ethnic or tribal solidarity. The equivalence of tribalism to ethnicity was referred locally as ''kesukuan''.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia – Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Communal violence in Indonesia includes numerous localized conflicts between various social groups found on its islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html Social violence in Indonesia is localized] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104117/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html |date=2016-03-04 }} Jakarta Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, communal violence is defined as that violence that occurs between different community who identify themselves based on religion, tribes, language, sect, race and others. Typically this sense of community identity comes from birth and is inherited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ACLED-Country-Report_Kenya_December-2013.pdf COUNTRY REPORT: KENYA – 2013] ACLED, Africa (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar definition has been applied for 47 African countries, where during 1990–2010, about 7,200 instances of communal violence and inter-ethnic conflicts has been seen.&lt;ref&gt;Idean Salehyan et al, Social Conflict in Africa: A New Database, International Interactions: Empirical and Theoretical Research in International Relations, Volume 38, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Cyprus Greek Turk Communal Violence at Ktima, Paphos.jpg|thumb|Damage from communal violence between Christian Greeks and Muslim Turks in [[Cyprus]].]]
Colm Campbell has proposed, after studying the empirical data and sequence of events during communal violence in South Africa, Palestinian Territories and Northern Ireland, that communal violence typically follows when there is degradation of rule of law, the state fails to or is widely seen as unable to provide order, security and equal justice, which then leads to mass mobilization, followed by radicalization of anger among one or more communities, and ultimately violent mobilization. Targeted mass violence by a few from one community against innocent members of other community, suppression of complaints, refusal to prosecute, killing peaceful demonstrators, imprisonment of people of a single community while refusal to arrest members of other community in conflict, perceived or actual prisoner abuse by the state are often the greatest mobilizers of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Campbell (2011), 'Beyond Radicalization: Towards an Integrated Anti-Violence Rule of Law Strategy', Transitional Justice Institute Research Paper No. 11-05, in Salinas de Friás, KLH Samuel and ND White (eds), Counter-Terrorism: International Law and Practice (Oxford University Press, Oxford 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stewart, Horizontal Inequalities and Conflict: Understanding Group Violence in Multiethnic Societies, {{ISBN|978-0230245501}}, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that ethnic segregation may also cause communal violence. Empirically estimating the effect of segregation on the incidence of violence across 700 localities in Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]] after the contested 2007–2008 general election, Kimuli Kahara finds that local ethnic segregation increases communal violence by decreasing interethnic trust rather than by making it easier to organize violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a small minority of individuals prefer to live in ethnically homogenous settings due to fear of other ethnic groups or otherwise, it can result in high degrees of ethnic segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|date=1971|title=Dynamic Models of Segregation|url=|journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=143–186|doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahara argues that such ethnic segregation decreases the possibility of positive contact across ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence? Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration and the resultant positive interethnic contact reduces prejudice by allowing individuals to correct false beliefs about members of other ethnic groups, improving intergroup relations consequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, segregation is correlated with low levels of interethnic trust. This widespread mistrust along ethnic lines explains the severity of communal violence by implying that when underlying mistrust is high, it is easier for extremists and elites to mobilize support for violence, and that where violence against members of other ethnic groups is supported by the public, perpetrators of such violence are less likely to face social sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict escalation''' is the process by which conflicts grow in severity over time. This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context.  In [[systems theory]], the process of conflict escalation is modeled by [[positive feedback]].

While the word ''escalation'' was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the [[Cold War]] by two  important books: ''On Escalation'' ([[Herman Kahn]], 1965) and ''Escalation and the Nuclear Option'' ([[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lawrence|title=The evolution of nuclear strategy|year=1993|publisher=St Martin's press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-02843-1|pages=198–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAxF8SBR3IC&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=%22The%20Impact%20of%20Atomic%20Weapons%20on%20Strategy%20and%20Tactics.%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]—the [[Cold War]].

Conflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit [[rules of engagement]]. Highly successful [[military tactics]] exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. [[Napoleon]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] both advocated this approach. [[Sun Tzu]] elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that [[military strategy]] was about minimizing escalation, and [[diplomacy]] about eliminating it.

==Continuum of force==
{{Main|Use of force continuum}}
The United States Marine Corps' "Continuum of Force" (found in MCRP 3-02B){{clarify|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? Be a little more specific --&gt; documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are:

===Level 1: Compliant (cooperative)===
The subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 2: Resistant (passive)===
The subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 3: Resistant (active)===
Initially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points.

===Level 4: Assaultive (bodily harm)===
The unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and [[Strike (attack)|blow]]s.

===Level 5: Assaultive (lethal force)===
The subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons.

==Preventing==
A major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a [[mindset]] to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in [[peacemaking]]. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of [[protest]]s, [[Strike action|strike]]s, or other [[direct action]]s.

[[Mohandas Gandhi]], a major proponent of [[nonviolence]], used satyagraha to demonstrate that:
*Peacefully controlling a group of people with a common cause was possible.
*One could accomplish objectives through [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] without capitulating to violent attack.
*His method ensured mutual support.
*It was possible to desist from retributive justice.
*It was not ultimately desirable to inflict [[punishment]], even when grievously wronged.

With this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided [[technological escalation]] and demonstrated to those in power that:
* The group was held together by its own discipline, and not by any kind of authority using violence.
* Authority could surrender without being subjected to violence.
* Authority could depart safely.
* Authority could devolve without obstacles, for the [[dissent]] was well enough organized to constitute an effective [[political party]].

==Conflict escalation curve==
{{Original research section|date=September 2016}}
The conflict escalation curve is a concept created by [[Michael N. Nagler]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far [[dehumanization]] has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).

The curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed.
 
The curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages.

===Stage 1: Conflict resolution===
In the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.

===Stage 2: Satyagraha===
The conflict escalates into [[satyagraha]], or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called "the law of suffering"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation.

Invoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: "The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering."&lt;ref&gt;K. Shridharani, "War without Violence" P. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders.

===Stage 3: Sacrifice: the last resort===
When the conflict has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous "fasts unto death" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like [[Kathy Kelly]] who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.

The philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion.

===How to use the conflict escalation curve===
The conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried.

For example, in 2003, US President [[George W. Bush]] dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as "a focus group," saying: "Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Richard|title=Antiwar Protests Fail to Sway Bush on Plans for Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/international/middleeast/19IRAQ.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=NY Times|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming.

==Systems view==
Carol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory.{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Jay Forrester]] and [[Donella Meadows]] observed that people in crisis would often push the [[twelve leverage points]] towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo.{{cn|date=February 2007}}

{{For|other kinds of conflict|conflict (disambiguation)}}
'''Cultural conflict''' is a type of [[conflict (process)|conflict]] that occurs when different [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s clash. It has been used to explain violence and crime.

==Wider definition==
[[Jonathan H. Turner]] defines it as a conflict caused by "differences in [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s that place people at odds with one another".&lt;ref name="Turner2005-87"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a micro level, Alexander Grewe discusses a cultural conflict between guests of different culture and nationality as seen in a British 1970 sitcom, ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Grewe|title="I'm sick to death with you..." or External Character Conflicts in Fawlty Towers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRnUcigKzqEC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=17 October 2005|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-638-42885-9|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines this conflict as one that occurs when '''people's''' expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met, as others have different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"/&gt;

Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt;  Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in [[politics]], particularly on a macro level.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of cultural conflict is [[Abortion debate|the debate]] over [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt; [[Ethnic cleansing]] is another extreme example of cultural conflict.&lt;ref name="AndersenTaylor2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L. Andersen|author2=Howard F. Taylor|title=Sociology: The Essentials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTvpA0P3u-gC&amp;pg=PT72|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-83156-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on [[slavery]] were one of the reasons for the [[American civil war]].&lt;ref name="Fellman1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Fellman|title=Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LldHnF7CB3kC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=19 April 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506471-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrow definition==
A more narrow definition of a cultural conflict dates to [[Daniel Bell]]'s 1962 essay, "Crime as an American Way of Life", and focuses on [[criminal]]-enabling consequences of a clash in cultural values.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Kornblum|title=Sociology in a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&amp;pg=PT191|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=31 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30157-6|pages=191–192; 195, 197, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kornblum]] defines it as a conflict that occurs when conflicting [[Norm (social)|norm]]s create "opportunities for deviance and criminal gain in deviant [[sub-culture]]s".&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; Kornblum notes that whenever laws impose cultural values on a group that does not share those views (often, this is the case of the majority imposing their laws on a minority), illegal markets supplied by criminals are created to circumvent those laws.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; He discusses the example of [[prohibition]] in the [[interbellum]] United States, and notes how the cultural conflict between pro- and anti-alcohol groups created opportunities for illegal activity; another similar example he lists is that of the [[war on drugs]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;

Kornblum also classifies the cultural conflict as one of the major types of [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;  In ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'' [[Samuel P. Huntington]] proposes that people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world.

==Influence and understanding==
Michelle LeBaron describes different cultures as "underground rivers that run through our lives and relationships, giving us messages that shape our perceptions, attributions, judgments, and ideas of self and other".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/bi-essay/culture-conflict |title=Culture and Conflict |publisher=Beyond Intractability |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that cultural messages "shape our understandings" when two or more people are present in regards to relationships, conflict, and peace.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; LeBaron discusses the influence of culture as being powerful and "unconscious, influencing conflict and attempts to resolve conflict in imperceptible ways".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; She states that the impact of culture is huge, affecting "name, frame, blame, and attempt to tame conflicts".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Due to the huge impact that culture has on us, LeBaron finds it important to explain the "complications of conflict".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; First, "culture is multi-layered", meaning that "what you see on the surface may mask differences below the surface".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Second, "culture is constantly in flux", meaning that "cultural groups adapt in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable ways".&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Third, "culture is elastic", meaning that one member of a cultural group may not participate in the norms of the culture.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt; Lastly, "culture is largely below the surface", meaning that it isn't easy to reach the deeper levels of culture and its meanings.&lt;ref name="Michelle LeBaron" /&gt;

[[File:Decentralization.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Graphical comparison of a centralised (A) and a decentralised (B) system]]

A '''decentralised system''' in [[systems theory]] is a system in which lower level components operate on local information to accomplish global goals. The global pattern of behaviour is an [[emergent property]] of dynamical mechanisms that act upon local components, such as indirect communication, rather than the result of a central ordering influence (see [[centralised system]]).

==Centralised versus decentralised systems==
A centralised system is one in which a central controller exercises control over the lower-level components of the system directly or through the use of a power [[hierarchy]] (such as instructing a middle level component to instruct a lower level component).&lt;ref&gt;Bekey, G. A. (2005). Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complexity|complex]] [[behaviour]] exhibited by this system is thus the result of the central controller's "control" over lower level components in the system, including the active supervision of the lower level components.

A decentralised system, on the other hand, is one in which complex behaviour emerges through the work of lower level components operating on local information, not the instructions of any commanding influence. This form of control is known as [[distributed control]], or control in which each component of the system is equally responsible for contributing to the global, complex behaviour by acting on local information in the appropriate manner. The lower level components are implicitly aware of these appropriate responses through mechanisms that are based on the component's interaction with the environment, including other components in that environment.

==Self-organisation==
Decentralised systems are intricately linked to the idea of [[self-organisation]]—a phenomenon in which local interactions between components of a system establish order and coordination to achieve global goals without a central commanding influence. The rules specifying these interactions emerge from local information and in the case of biological (or biologically-inspired) agents, from the closely linked perception and action system of the agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01048-3 |title=Self-organization in social insects |year=1997 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=Eric |last2=Theraulaz |first2=Guy |last3=Deneubourg |first3=Jean-Louls |last4=Aron |first4=Serge |last5=Camazine |first5=Scott |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions continually form and depend on [[spatio-temporal pattern]]s, which are created through the [[positive feedback|positive]] and [[negative feedback]] that the interactions provide. For example, recruitment in the [[foraging]] behaviour of [[ants]] relies on the positive feedback of the ant finding food at the end of a [[pheromone]] trail while ants' [[task switching (psychology)|task-switching]] behaviour relies on the negative feedback of making [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] contact with a certain number of ants (for example, a sufficiently low encounter rate with successful foragers can cause a midden worker to switch to foraging, although other factors like food availability can affect the threshold for switching).

== Examples ==
While decentralised systems can easily be found in nature, they are also evident in aspects of human society such as governmental and economic systems.

=== Biological: Insect colonies ===
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|right|thumb|A large number of [[Ant]]s eating a piece of [[fruit]].]]

One of the most well known examples of a "natural" decentralized system is one used by certain [[Insect colony|insect colonies]]. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the [[homogeneous]] biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to collectively create complex, global behaviour. While individually exhibiting simple behaviours, these agents achieve global goals such as feeding the colony or raising the [[Offspring|brood]] by using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central control, these insect colonies achieve global goals by performing required tasks, responding to changing conditions in the colony environment in terms of task-activity, and subsequently adjusting the number of workers performing each task to ensure that all tasks are completed.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Gordon, D. (2010). Ant Encounters: Interaction Networks and Colony Behavior. Princeton, NJ: [[Princeton U Press]]. {{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ant colonies guide their global behaviour (in terms of foraging, patrolling, [[brood care]], and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of [[spatio-temporal pattern]]ed interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and [[olfaction|olfactory]] sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behaviour of other ants and thus never have a "central controller" dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.

Instead, ants use a flexible [[task allocation and partitioning of social insects|task-allocation system]] that allows the colony to respond rapidly to changing needs for achieving these goals. This task-allocation system, similar to a [[division of labor]] is flexible in that all tasks rely on either the number of ant encounters (which take the form of antennal contact) and the sensing of chemical gradients (using olfactory sensing for pheromone trails) and can thus be applied to the entire ant population. While recent research has shown that certain tasks may have physiologically and age-based response thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19776072 |year=2009 |last1=Robinson |first1=EJ |last2=Feinerman |first2=O |last3=Franks |first3=NR |title=Flexible task allocation and the organization of work in ants |volume=276 | issue=1677 |pages=4373–80 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1244 |pmc=2817103 |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; all tasks can be completed by "any" ant in the colony.

For example, in foraging behaviour, [[red harvester ants]] (''Pogonomyrmex barbatus'') communicate to other ants where [[food]] is, how much food there is, and whether or not they should switch tasks to forage based on cuticular [[hydrocarbon]] scents and the rate of ant-interaction. By using the combined odors of forager cuticular hydrocarbons and of seeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/423032a |title=Social insects: [[Cuticular hydrocarbon]]s inform task decisions |year=2003 |last1=Greene |first1=Michael J. |last2=Gordon |first2=Deborah M. |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6935 |pages=32 |pmid=12721617}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interaction rate using brief antennal contact, the colony captures precise information about the current availability of food and thus whether or not they should switch to foraging behaviour "all without being directed by a central controller or even another ant". The rate at which foragers return with seeds sets the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest on foraging trips; faster rates of return indicate more food availability and fewer interactions indicate a greater need for foragers. A combination of these two factors, which are solely based on local information from the environment, leads to decisions about switching to the foraging task and ultimately, to achieving the global goal of feeding the colony.

In short, the use of a combination of simple cues makes it possible for red harvester ant colonies to make an accurate and rapid adjustment of foraging activity that corresponds to the current availability of food&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052219 |title=Interactions with Combined Chemical Cues Inform Harvester Ant Foragers' Decisions to Leave the Nest in Search of Food |year=2013 |editor1-last=Fenton |editor1-first=Brock |last1=Greene |first1=Michael J. |last2=Pinter-Wollman |first2=Noa |last3=Gordon |first3=Deborah M. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e52219 |pmid=23308106 |issue=1 |pmc=3540075}}&lt;/ref&gt; while using positive feedback for regulation of the process: the faster outgoing foragers meet ants returning with seeds, the more ants go out to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |work=Stanford Report |date=May 15, 2013 |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/may/ants-forage-evolve-051413.html |title=Evolution shapes new rules for ant behavior, Stanford research finds |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ants then continue to use these local cues in finding food, as they use their olfactory senses to pick up pheromone trails laid by other ants and follow the trail in a descending gradient to the food source. Instead of being directed by other ants or being told as to where the food is, ants rely on their closely coupled action and perception systems to collectively complete the global task.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

While [[red harvester ant]] colonies achieve their global goals using a decentralised system, not all insect colonies function this way. For example, the foraging behaviour of ''[[wasps]]'' is under the constant regulation and control of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/156853986X00090 |title=Queen Regulation of Worker Foraging in [[Paper Wasp]]s: A Social Feedback Control System (Polistes Fuscatus, Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |year=1987 |last1=Reeve |first1=Hudson K. |last2=Gamboa |first2=George J. |journal=Behaviour |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human society: Market economy ===
A [[market economy]] is an economy in which decisions on investment and the allocation of producer goods are mainly made through markets and not by a plan of production (see [[planned economy]]). A market economy is a decentralised economic system because it does not function via a central, economic plan (which is usually headed by a governmental body) but instead, acts through the distributed, local interactions in the market (e.g. individual [[investment]]s). While a "market economy" is a broad term and can differ greatly in terms of state or governmental control (and thus central control), the final "behaviour" of any market economy emerges from these local interactions and is not directly the result of a central body's set of instructions or regulation.

==Application==
[[File:RechargingSwarm.jpg|thumb|right|Swarm of [[open-source]] Jasmine micro-robots recharging themselves]]

===Artificial intelligence and robotics===
While classic [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) in the 1970s was focused on knowledge-based systems or planning robots, [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[behavior-based robotics|behaviour-based robots]] and their success in acting in the real, unpredictably changing world has led many AI researchers to shift from a planned, centralised symbolic architecture to studying intelligence as an emergent product of simple interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JRA.1986.1087032 |title=A robust layered control system for a mobile robot |year=1986 |last1=Brooks |first1=R. |journal=IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation |volume=2 |pages=14|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA160833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This thus reflects a general shift from applying a centralised system in robotics to applying a more decentralised system based on local interactions at various levels of abstraction.

For example, largely stemming from [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon's]] [[physical symbol system|physical-symbol theory]], researchers in the 1970s designed robots with a course of action that, when executed, would result in the achievement of some desired goal; thus the robots were seen as "intelligent" if they could follow the directions of their central controller (the program or the programmer) (for an example, see [[STRIPS]]). However, upon Rodney Brooks' introduction of [[subsumption architecture]], which enabled robots to perform "intelligent" behaviour without using symbolic knowledge or explicit reasoning, increasingly more researchers have viewed intelligent behaviour as an emergent property that arises from an agent's interaction with the environment, including other agents in that environment.

While certain researchers have begun to design their robots with closely coupled perception and action systems and attempted to [[embodied agent|embody]] and [[situated cognition|situate]] their agents a la Brooks, other researchers have attempted to simulate multi-agent behaviour and thus further dissect the phenomena of decentralised systems in achieving global goals. For example, in 1996, Minar, Burkhard, Lang-ton and Askenazi created a multi-agent software platform for the stimulation of interacting agents and their emergent collective behaviour called "[[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]]". While the basic unit in Swarm is the "swarm", a collection of agents executing a schedule of actions, agents can be composed of swarms of other agents in nested structures. As the software also provides object-oriented libraries of reusable components for building models and analyzing, displaying and controlling experiments on those models, it ultimately attempts to not only simulate multi-agent behaviour but to serve as a basis for further exploration of how collective groups of agents can achieve global goals through careful, yet implicit, coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Minar |first1=N. |last2=Burkhart |first2=R. |last3=Langton |first3=C. |last4=Askenazi |first4=M. |year=1996 |url=http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/70e0c84b2cff6e8e87f2940fa60965e9/ |title=The Swarm Simulation System: A Toolkit for Building Multi-Agent Simulations |work=SFI Working Papers |publisher=Sante Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Water molecule (1).svg|thumb|right|The subject of the parody, water, has a molecule consisting of two [[hydrogen]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom, thus the name dihydrogen monoxide.]]

The '''dihydrogen monoxide parody''' involves calling [[water]] by the unfamiliar chemical name "'''dihydrogen monoxide'''" ('''DHMO'''), or "'''hydroxylic acid'''" in some cases, and listing some of water's well-known effects in a particularly alarming manner, such as [[rust|accelerating corrosion]] and [[drowning|causing suffocation]]. The parody often calls for dihydrogen monoxide to be banned, regulated, and labeled as dangerous. It illustrates how a lack of [[scientific literacy]] and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.

==History==
A 1983 [[April Fools' Day]] edition of the ''[[Durand Express]]'', a weekly newspaper in [[Durand, Michigan]], reported that "dihydrogen oxide"&lt;!--the source calls it "oxide"--&gt; had been found in the city's water pipes, and warned that it was fatal if inhaled, and could produce blistering vapors.&lt;ref name="Durand"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1983.html |title=April Fool's Day, 1983 |publisher=Museum of Hoaxes |access-date=November 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010418103649/http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1983.html |archive-date=April 18, 2001 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance of the parody on the Internet was attributed by the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' to the so-called "Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide",&lt;ref name="greatmoments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=April 19, 1997 |title=Internet-inspired prank lands 4 teens in hot water |first=Dennis B. |last=Roddy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-uZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0G8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5974%2C1742699 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a parody organization at UC Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] discussions in 1990.&lt;ref name="recdothumor" /&gt;

Dihydrogen monoxide:
* is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
* contributes to the "greenhouse effect".
* may cause severe burns.
* contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
* accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
* may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.
* has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
* as an industrial solvent and coolant.
* in nuclear power plants.
* in the production of styrofoam.
* as a fire retardant.
* in many forms of cruel animal research.
* in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
* as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.

A mock [[material safety data sheet]] has also been created for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/2010/03/24/dhmo-material-safety-data-sheet/ |title=DHMO Material Safety Data Sheet |publisher=Improbable Research |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhmo.org/msds/MSDS-DHMO-Kemp.pdf |title=Material Safety Sheet – DiHydrogen Monoxide |publisher=DHMO.org |access-date=November 25, 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular terminology and naming conventions ==
The water [[molecule]] has the [[chemical formula]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, meaning each molecule of water is composed of two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s and one [[oxygen]] atom. Literally, the term "dihydrogen monoxide" means "two hydrogen, one oxygen", consistent with its molecular formula: the prefix ''[[Wiktionary:di-|di-]]'' in ''dihydrogen'' means "two", the prefix ''[[Wiktionary:mono-|mon-]]'' in ''monoxide'' means "one", and an [[oxide]] is an oxygen atom attached to another atom in an ionic compound.&lt;ref name="nomenclature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.widener.edu/svb/pset/nomen_b.html |title=Chemical Nomenclature |first=S. E. |last=Van Bramer |year=1996 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[chemical nomenclature]], various names for water are in common use within the scientific community. Some such names include ''hydrogen oxide'', as well as an [[alkali]] name of ''hydrogen hydroxide'', and several acid names such as ''hydric acid'', ''hydroxic acid'', ''hydroxyl acid'', and ''hydroxilic acid''. The term "hydroxyl acid" used in the original text is a non-[[Naming acids#Nomenclature|standard]] name.&lt;ref name="other name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluelaketec.com/awater.htm |title=About Water |publisher=Bluelake Technologies |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}

Under the 2005 revisions of [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry]], there is no single correct name for every compound.&lt;ref name="IUPAC2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUP Recommendations 2005 |year=2005 |format=PDF |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited.&lt;ref name="IUPAC2004" /&gt; ''Water'' is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is ''oxidane,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leigh |first1=G.

== Public efforts involving the DHMO parody==
* In 1989&amp;ndash;1990, several students circulated a dihydrogen monoxide contamination warning on the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], campus via photocopied fliers.&lt;ref name="greatmoments"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matthew.at/dhm.pdf |title=Contamination Warning! |location=UC Santa Cruz |format=PDF |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1994, Craig Jackson created a web page for the Coalition to Ban DHMO.&lt;ref name="greatmoments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHMO coalition"/&gt;
* The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by [[Dan Curtis Johnson]]; partly as a foil on the Coalition page, claiming to oppose its "subversive agenda". The site points out that hydrogen hydroxide is "environmentally safe" and "enhances the functionality, growth, and health of many forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armory.com/~crisper/DHMO/ |title=Hydrogen Hydroxide: Now More Than Ever! |publisher=Armory.com |access-date=November 25, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523021635/http://www.armory.com/~crisper/DHMO/ |archive-date=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]], gathered 43 votes to ban the chemical, out of 50 ninth-graders surveyed. Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls [[science fair|Science Fair]] for analysis of the results of his survey.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt; In recognition of his experiment, journalist [[James K. Glassman]] coined the term "Zohnerism" to refer to "the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James K. |last=Glassman |author-link=James K.

* In late 1997, drawing inspiration from Jackson's web page and Zohner's research, Tom Way created a website at DHMO.org, including links to some legitimate sites such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{open access}}{{cite web |url=http://dhmo.org/presskit/ |title=Press Kit |publisher=DHMO.org |access-date=November 25, 2018}}{{password-protected}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In {{visible anchor|2001}}, a staffer in [[New Zealand Green Party]] MP [[Sue Kedgley]]'s office responded to a request for support for a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide by saying she was "absolutely supportive of the campaign to ban this toxic substance". This was criticized in a press release by the National Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0110/S00440.htm |title=Greens Support Ban On Water! |date=October 25, 2001 |publisher=[[Scoop Independent News]] |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] fell for the very same joke six years later.&lt;ref name="DeanAndKedgely"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gnad |first=Megan |title=MP tries to ban water |work=New Zealand Herald |date=September 14, 2007 |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10463579 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, radio talk show host [[Neal Boortz]] mentioned on the air that the [[Atlanta]] water system had been checked and found to be contaminated with dihydrogen monoxide, and set about relating the hazards associated with that "dangerous" chemical. A local TV station even covered the 'scandal'. A spokesperson for the city's water system told the reporter that there was no more dihydrogen monoxide in the system than what was allowed under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/neal-boortz-to-hang-up-the-headphones |title=Neal Boortz to Hang Up the Headphones |publisher=Fellowship Of The Minds |author=Dave |date=June 5, 2012 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The idea was used for a segment of an episode of the [[Penn &amp; Teller]] show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'', in which actress [[Kris McGaha]] and a camera crew gathered signatures from people considering themselves "concerned environmentalists" to sign a petition to ban DHMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= {{cite web |series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! |title=Environmental Hysteria |date=April 18, 2003 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0672528/ |season=1 |number=13 |access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2004, [[Aliso Viejo, California]], almost considered banning the use of foam containers at city-sponsored events because dihydrogen monoxide is part of their production.

{{short description|A situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms}}
'''Ecological collapse''' refers to a situation where an [[ecosystem]] suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in [[carrying capacity]] for all organisms, often resulting in [[mass extinction]]. Usually, an ecological collapse is precipitated by a disastrous event occurring on a short time scale. Ecological collapse can be considered as a consequence of [[ecosystem collapse]] on the biotic elements that depended on the original ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sato |first1=Chloe F. |last2=Lindenmayer |first2=David B. |title=Meeting the Global Ecosystem Collapse Challenge |journal=Conservation Letters |date=2018 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=e12348 |doi=10.1111/conl.12348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bland |first1=L. |last2=Rowland |first2=J. |last3=Regan |first3=T. |last4=Keith |first4=D. |last5=Murray |first5=N. |last6=Lester |first6=R. |last7=Linn |first7=M. |last8=Rodríguez |first8=J.P. |last9=Nicholson |first9=E. |title=Developing a standarized definition of ecosystem collapse for risk assessment |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=2018 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=29–36 |doi=10.1002/fee.1747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystems have the ability to rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or a gentle rebound is determined by two factors—the toxicity of the introduced element and the [[ecological resilience|resiliency of the original ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="Basic Civil Engineering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopi|title=Basic Civil Engineering|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|location=India|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through natural selection the planet's species have continuously adapted to change through variation in their biological composition and distribution. Mathematically it can be demonstrated that greater numbers of different biological factors tend to dampen fluctuations in each of the individual factors.&lt;ref name="Basic Civil Engineering"/&gt;

Scientists can predict tipping points for ecological collapse. The most frequently used model for predicting [[food web]] collapse is called R50, which is a reliable measurement model for food web robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The reliability of R50 as a measure of vulnerability of food webs to sequential species deletions|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.01588/abstract|journal = Oikos|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1600-0706|pages = 446–457|volume = 124|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/oik.01588|first = Tomas|last = Jonsson|first2 = Sofia|last2 = Berg|first3 = Alexander|last3 = Pimenov|first4 = Catherine|last4 = Palmer|first5 = Mark|last5 = Emmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and examples==
Although, there is no single cause for ecological collapse,  attributing factors include [[asteroid impact]]s, [[Large igneous province|extremely large volcanic eruptions]], and [[abrupt climate change]]. The snowball effect of these attributing factors and ecological collapse are demonstrated within the [[fossil record]]. [[Prehistoric]] examples include the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]], the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], and other [[mass extinctions]]. For example, effects of [[climate change]] as a contributing factor towards ecological collapse are demonstrated in the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC Nature|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Ordovician-Silurian_extinction_event|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible cause of the Ordovician Extinction was global cooling which affected the habitats of marine life. Consequently, sea creatures such as trilobites, brachiopods, and graptolites became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC Nature|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Ordovician%25E2%2580%2593Silurian_extinction_event|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Karabonov and colleagues conducted a study to show how during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM), alternations in the environment and climate led to ecological collapse in [[Lake Baikal]] and [[Lake Hovsgol]] which then led to species evolution in these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecological collapse of Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol ecosystems during the Last Glacial and consequences for aquatic species diversity|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099|journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date = 2004-07-06|pages = 227–243|volume = 209|series = High Latitude Eurasian Palaeoenvironments|issue = 1–4|doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.02.017|first = Eugene|last = Karabanov|first2 = Douglas|last2 = Williams|first3 = Mikhail|last3 = Kuzmin|first4 = Valentina|last4 = Sideleva|first5 = Galina|last5 = Khursevich|first6 = Alexander|last6 = Prokopenko|first7 = Emilia|last7 = Solotchina|first8 = Lilia|last8 = Tkachenko|first9 = Svetlana|last9 = Fedenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of Hovsgol's ecosystem during the LGM brought forth a new ecosystem, with limited biodiversity in species and low levels of [[endemism]], in Hovsgol during the Holocene. Karabonov's study also shows that ecological collapse during LGM in Lake Hovsgol led to higher levels of diversity and higher levels of endemism as a byproduct of evolution following the ecological collapse of the LGM. The Ordovician Extinction event and Lake Baikal and Hovsgol demonstrate two effects of ecological collapse on prehistoric environments.

Historic examples include the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of the Grand Banks cod]] in the early 1990s, attributed to [[overfishing]].

Important pressures contributing to current and future ecological collapse include [[habitat loss]], [[habitat degradation|degradation]], and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], overgrazing, [[overexploitation]] of ecosystems by humans, human industrial growth and overpopulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Overpopulation and Ecosystem Collapse {{!}} EcoInternet - Earth Blog|url = http://ecointernet.org/2014/05/17/on-overpopulation-and-ecosystem-collapse/|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]],[[ocean acidification]], [[pollution]], and [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Living Planet Report|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainforest collapse==
Rainforest collapse refers to the actual past and theoretical future ecological collapse of [[rainforest]]s. It may involve [[habitat fragmentation]] to the point where little rainforest [[biome]] is left, and rainforest species only survive in isolated refugia. Habitat fragmentation can be caused by roads. When humans start to cut down the trees for logging, secondary roads are created that will go unused after its primary use. Once abandoned, the plants of the rainforest will find it difficult to grow back in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Legacy of logging roads in the Congo Basin: How persistent are the scars in forest cover?|url = http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00488.1|journal = Ecosphere|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 2150-8925|pages = art64|volume = 6|issue = 4|doi = 10.1890/ES14-00488.1|first = Fritz|last = Kleinschroth|first2 = Sylvie|last2 = Gourlet-Fleury|first3 = Plinio|last3 = Sist|first4 = Fréderic|last4 = Mortier|first5 = John R.|last5 = Healey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest fragmentation also opens the path for illegal hunting. Species have a hard time finding a new place to settle in these fragments causing ecological collapse. This leads to extinction of many animals in the rainforest.

=== Carboniferous period ===
{{Main article|Carboniferous rainforest collapse}}

In the [[Carboniferous]] period, [[coal forest]]s, great [[tropical wetland]]s, extended over much of Euramerica (Europe and America). This land supported towering [[lycopsid]]s which fragmented and collapsed abruptly.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the rainforests during the [[Carboniferous]] has been attributed to [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse#Possible causes|multiple causes]], including [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Fielding, C.R. |author2=Frank, T.D. |author3=Birgenheier, L.P. |author4=Rygel, M.C. |author5=Jones, A.T. |author6=and Roberts, J. | year=2008 | title=Stratigraphic imprint of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age in eastern Australia: A record of alternating glacial and nonglacial climate regime | journal=Geological Society of London Journal | volume =  165| pages = 129–140 | doi=10.1144/0016-76492007-036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. This sudden collapse affected several large groups including lycopsids and amphibians. Reptiles prospered in the new environment due to adaptations that let them thrive in drier conditions.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fishbone pattern of rainforest fragmentation]]

== Today ==
A classic pattern of [[forest fragmentation]] is occurring in many [[rainforest]]s including those of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]], specifically a 'fishbone' pattern formed by the development of roads into the forest. This is of great concern, not only because of the loss of a [[biome]] with many untapped resources and wholesale death of living organisms, but also because plant and animal species extinction is known to correlate with habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space &amp; time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Overgrazing]] was found to cause [[land degradation]], specifically in Southern Europe, which is another driver of ecological collapse and natural landscape loss. Proper management of pastoral landscapes can mitigate risk of desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploring the Impact of Overgrazing on Soil Erosion and Land Degradation in a Dry Mediterranean Agro-Forest Landscape (Crete, Greece)|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2014.968691|journal = Arid Land Research and Management|date = 2015-07-03|issn = 1532-4982|pages = 360–374|volume = 29|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/15324982.2014.968691|first = Orestis|last = Kairis|first2 = Christos|last2 = Karavitis|first3 = Luca|last3 = Salvati|first4 = Aikaterini|last4 = Kounalaki|first5 = Kostas|last5 = Kosmas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 roughly 170 million gallons of oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico when BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. The effects of the BP oil spill are still being felt today, more than 8,000 marine birds, sea turtles and marine mammals were found dead or injured within months of the clean up effort. The impact of this disaster has unbalanced the food web of the environment. The oil spill occurred at the height of breeding season and as result affected egg and larval animals to the worst extent wiping entire age classes. This loss of a generation down the line will prove dire for future predators of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Protect-Habitat/Gulf-Restoration/Oil-Spill/Effects-on-Wildlife.aspx|title = How Does the BP Oil Spill Impact Wildlife and Habitat?|date = 2015-10-28|accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = National Wildlife Federation|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a major concern for marine biologists is the effects of ecological collapse on the coral reefs (who based on fossil evidence are more vulnerable to extinction but also demonstrate greater resilience&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The future of coral reefs|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5419|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2001-05-08|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 33228|pmid = 11344288|pages = 5419–5425|volume = 98|issue = 10|doi = 10.1073/pnas.091092998|first = Nancy|last = Knowlton}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An effect of global climate change is the rising sea levels which can lead to reef drowing or [[coral bleaching]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Human activity, such as fishing, mining, deforestation, etc., serves as a threat for coral reefs by affecting the niche of the coral reefs. For example, Edinger and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reef degradation and coral biodiversity in indonesia: Effects of land-based pollution, destructive fishing practices and changes over time|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X98000472|journal = Marine Pollution Bulletin|date = 1998-08-01|pages = 617–630|volume = 36|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/S0025-326X(98)00047-2|first = Evan N|last = Edinger|first2 = Jamaluddin|last2 = Jompa|first3 = Gino V|last3 = Limmon|first4 = Wisnu|last4 = Widjatmoko|first5 = Michael J|last5 = Risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate a correlation between a loss in diversity of coral reefs by 30-60% and human activity such as sewage and/or industrial pollution.

The ocean is in great danger of collapse. In a study of 154 different marine fish species, David Byler found out that many factors such as overfishing, climate change, and fast growth of fish populations will cause ecosystem collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fishing, fast growth and climate variability increase the risk of collapse|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151053|journal = Proc. R. Soc. B|date = 2015-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmid = 26246548|pages = 20151053|volume = 282|issue = 1813|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.1053|first = Malin L.|last = Pinsky|first2 = David|last2 = Byler|pmc=4632620}}&lt;/ref&gt; When humans fish, they usually will fish the populations of the higher trophic levels such as salmon and tuna. The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen(DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.

Although global climate change and human dominance are inevitable, humans can institute greater self-awareness in order to aid the habits of creatures such as coral reefs.

Some scientists predict that a global ecological collapse will occur after 50% of the natural landscape is gone due to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Fear Global Ecological Collapse Once 50% of the Natural Landscape is Gone|url = http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/scientists-fear-global-ecological-collapse-once-50-natural-landscape-gone.html|website = TreeHugger|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Although the causes of ecological collapse are due to factors unique to their environment, they all for the most part share similar ramifications such as loss in biodiversity, trophic cascades, and even extinction. For example, the urbanization and deforestation of the South east Asian Pacific has led to the extinction of three plant species and eight animal species in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sodhi, Koh, Brook, Ng|first1=Navjot, Lian, Barry, Peter|title=Southeast Asian Biodiversity and impending disaster|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=December 2004|volume=19|issue=12|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.09.006|pages=654–660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Edmund Harvey''' (4 January 1875 – 3 May 1955), generally known as '''Edmund Harvey''', was an English museum curator, social reformer and politician. He sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], first as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and later as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent Progressive]]. He was also a prolific writer on Christianity and the role and history of the [[Society of Friends]].

==Family and education==
Harvey was born in [[Leeds]] to a prominent [[Quaker]] family.&lt;ref name="times15"&gt;The Times, 4 May 1955 p15&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of William Harvey, a teacher and art collector, who made a substantial gift of paintings by Dutch and Flemish masters to the nation, as well as being a local politician, serving for 13 years on Leeds City Council.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 2 May 1928 p11&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Harvey was educated at [[Bootham School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= |title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England|publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association|year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[York]] and attended [[University of Leeds|Yorkshire College, Leeds]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He also studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris, as well as at other institutions overseas. In 1900 he received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree from Oxford University with First Class honours in [[Literae Humaniores]]. He later received an honorary [[Doctorate of Laws]] from Leeds University.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;''Who was Who'', OUP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he married Alice Irene Thompson, the daughter of the eminent physicist Professor [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 19 July 1911 p11&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother was the writer [[W. F. Harvey|William Fryer Harvey]], best known for his short story [[The Beast with Five Fingers]] that was turned into a film of the same name, starring [[Peter Lorre]].

==Career==
In 1900 Harvey enrolled as an assistant at the [[British Museum]], where he worked until 1904.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; However, he was also deeply interested in social reform and welfare, especially the alleviation of poverty, educational and prison reform issues.&lt;ref name="times15"/&gt; He chose to pursue this work through the [[settlement movement]], and was a resident of [[Toynbee Hall]] from 1900, Deputy Warden from July 1904 and became Warden of Toynbee Hall, 1906–1911.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs &amp; Anne Macartney, ''Toynbee Hall: the first hundred years''; Routledge &amp; Keegan Paul, 1984, p80&lt;/ref&gt; From 1906 to 1910 he was a member of the Central (Unemployed) Body for London,&lt;ref name="times41"&gt;''The Times House of Commons, 1910''; Politico’s Publishing 2004 p41&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation responsible for registering those unemployed men applying for unemployment relief and finding work for them.&lt;ref&gt;R H Tawney, ''The Report of the Central Unemployed Body for London''; The Economic Journal, Volume 18, No. 72, December 1908&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 to 1921 he was Warden of Swarthmore Settlement in Leeds.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; Harvey was among a number of reformers, including [[R. H. Tawney]] and Harvey's predecessor as Warden of Toynbee Hall, Canon [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]], who recognised that the emphasis of settlement work needed to be moved away from the simple provision of relief and help and towards a wider agenda based upon social investigation, the raising of public awareness of social problems and broader political legislation.&lt;ref&gt;C Crouch &amp; A F Heath (eds.), ''Social research and social reform: essays in honour of A.H. Halsey''; Oxford University Press, 1992 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
===London politics===

Harvey’s politics were strongly linked to his religious and social beliefs. He was elected to the [[London County Council]] for [[Finsbury East (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury East]] as a [[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive]] and served 1904–1907, during which time he sat on the Education Committee.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 3 May 1904 p3&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an elected member of [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney Borough Council]] 1909–1911.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

===West Leeds===
[[File:Blue plaque, Thomas Edmund Harvey - Grosvenor Road, Headingley.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque on his house in Headingley, Leeds]]
Harvey first stood for Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910]], for [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]], holding [[Herbert Gladstone]]'s old seat for the Liberals by a majority of 3,315 votes.&lt;ref name="times41"/&gt; He retained Leeds West at the [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910 general election]], increasing his majority to 4,270.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times House of Commons, 1911''; Politico's Publishing 2004 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

While an MP, Harvey was a member of the Standing Committee on Boy Labour in the Post Office (1910–1917).&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 11 March 1911 p7&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as unpaid [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Sir Ellis Ellis-Griffith, 1st Baronet|Ellis Ellis-Griffith]] [[King's Counsel|KC]], [[Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Home Office]],&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; and performed the same role for [[Charles Masterman]], [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], 1913–1914,&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 18 July 1913 p10&lt;/ref&gt; although he resigned the post on the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Packer (ed.), ''The letters of Arnold Stephenson Rowntree to Mary Katherine Rowntree, 1910–1918''; Cambridge University Press, 2002 p23n&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism and conscientious objection===

As a Quaker, Harvey was placed in a difficult personal position by Britain's declaration of war in August 1914. Quakers traditionally took the view that all war is incompatible with the spirit and teachings of Christ. Harvey was a [[pacifist]] and profoundly wished to keep Britain out of the war and supported those elements in the government, particularly the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]], who were working to prevent a general war.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Hazlehurst, ''Politicians at War, July 1914 – May 1915''; Jonathan Cape, 1971 p39&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey remained one of the small band of Liberals, at that time still including [[Norman Angell]] and [[E D Morel]], who had grave doubts about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Douglas, ''Liberals: a history of the Liberal and Liberal Democratic parties''; Hambledon &amp; London, 2005 p166&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Throughout the First World War and until 1920 Harvey, in the Quaker tradition, engaged personally in relief work in the war zone in France, on behalf of the War Victims’ Relief Committee of the [[Society of Friends]].&lt;ref name="times15"/&gt; But Harvey's dilemma over support for the government, as distinct from his religious beliefs, surfaced when he and another Liberal Quaker MP, [[Arnold Stephenson Rowntree]], helped to draft the section of the [[Military Service Act 1916]] that provided for the possibility of [[conscientious objectors]] being required to perform work of national importance as a condition of exemption from service in the army. There was disagreement among Quakers about the sort of service, if any, which conscientious objectors should be asked to do, and Harvey and Rowntree were accused of arrogating to themselves the right to specify what objectors might do and of misrepresenting to the authorities the extent to which they could speak for Quaker opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Griffin (ed.), ''The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell: The Public Years, 1914–1970''; Routledge, 2002 pp60-62&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a member of the Pelham Committee (formally, the Committee on Work of National Importance), the body charged in March 1916 with trying to find suitable civilian occupations for conscientious objectors prepared to undertake the work of national importance he had helped to be written into the Military Service Act.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

===Dewsbury===

Harvey stood down from Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], but tried to re-enter the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]], having in 1921 been selected as Liberal candidate for [[Dewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Dewsbury]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 30 May 1921 p7&lt;/ref&gt; Dewsbury had been [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Sir Walter Runciman]]'s seat up until 1918, when, as an opponent of the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]] of [[David Lloyd George]], Runciman had been opposed by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Coalition Conservative]] who had the benefit of the [[Coalition coupon|government coupon]]. In a three-cornered contest Harvey nearly regained the seat for the Liberals in 1922, but lost to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate [[Ben Riley]] by 756 votes (3.3% of the total vote), the Conservative candidate [[Osbert Peake, 1st Viscount Ingleby|Osbert Peake]], later to be MP for [[Leeds North (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North]] came third.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p126&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey was, however, returned to Parliament for Dewsbury at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]], when he defeated Riley in a straight fight to win by a majority of 2,256 votes. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 general election]] the situation was again reversed. This time Riley won the seat back, and in a three-cornered contest Harvey fell to the bottom of the poll.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;

===1929–1937===

Harvey did not stand for election in Dewsbury again. For the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] he returned to his old stamping ground of Leeds. On this occasion he abandoned Leeds West, where Liberal candidates had come bottom of the poll at the last three general elections, trying Leeds North instead. He was not successful, coming third in a three-way fight with his old antagonist Osbert Peake winning the seat for the [[Tories]].&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p161&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey continued to support the Liberal Party, being sometime Yorkshire representative on the [[National Liberal Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 17 December 1931 p14&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not stand for Parliament in the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]] or [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935]].

===MP for the Combined English Universities===

In 1937 Harvey was chosen as a candidate in a by-election for the [[Combined English Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined English Universities]] seat. He stood as an Independent Progressive candidate, saying that contests for the University seats ought to be fought on ideas and not on party political lines. Against him were Conservative and Independent rivals, but Harvey won with a majority of 1,644 votes.&lt;ref&gt;F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p668&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his links with Liberalism, however – the party leader [[Sir Archibald Sinclair|Sir Archie Sinclair]], [[Ramsay Muir]] and the Liberal Party Organisation all sent messages of congratulation to Harvey when he won the by-election.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 23 March 1937 p16&lt;/ref&gt; He held the Combined English Universities seat until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], when he stood down from Parliament for the last time, aged 70.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 6 July 1945 p2&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Parliament as an Independent, and consistent with his representation of a University seat, Harvey championed the plight of foreign academics and scientist forced by various regimes to flee as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 3 February 1939 p9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 6 February 1939 p9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appointments==
Retaining his lifelong interest in social reform, Harvey was a Master of the charitable trust the [[Guild of St George]] 1934–51. Harking back to his museum work and because of his father's gift of paintings to the nation, Harvey also served as the Chairman of the National Loan Collection Trust, the body set up to co-ordinate the lending of pictures to municipal and other provincial art galleries.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

==Death==
Harvey died at his home, Rydal House, Grosvenor Road, Leeds&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 4 May 1955, p15&lt;/ref&gt; on 3 May 1955 aged 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The House of Commons Constituencies Beginning With "D" |url=http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Dcommons2.htm |website=/www.leighrayment.com |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglantyne Jebb 1920.jpg|thumb|Eglantyne Jebb]]
'''Eglantyne Jebb,'''  (25 August 1876 – 17 December 1928) was a British [[reform movement|social reformer]] and founder of the [[Save the Children]] organisation.

== Early life ==
She was born in 1876 in [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]], and grew up on her family's estate. The Jebbs were a well-off family and had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service. Her mother, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], had founded the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]], to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas; her sister Louisa would help found the [[Women's Land Army]] in [[World War I]]. Another sister, [[Dorothy Frances Jebb]], who married the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Charles Roden Buxton]], campaigned against the demonisation of the German people after the war.
She also served a faculty member at [[Wellesley College]] in 1929, teaching courses in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley College, [http://repository.wellesley.edu/news/796 "The Wellesley News (05-31-1928)"] (1928). ''The Wellesley News''. Book 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nickname ==
She was known as the "White Flame" because the flame of her [[philanthropy|dedicated love]] for children in distress burned to a white heat of passion all her life.

== Social activism ==
Having studied history at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb trained to become a school teacher, but a year's experience as a Primary School teacher, at St. Peter's Junior School in Marlborough, convinced her that this was not her vocation, though it increased her awareness of the difficulties and widespread nature of poverty faced by young children.

She moved to [[Cambridge]] to look after her sick mother. There she became involved in the [[Charity Organisation Society]], which aimed to bring a modern scientific approach to charity work. This led her to carry out an extensive research project into conditions in the city, and in 1906 she published a book, ''Cambridge, a Study in Social Questions'' based on her research.

The Cambridge Independent Press, a weekly liberal-supporting newspaper published a number of articles covering Eglantyne's campaigning and political activities in Cambridge in the run up to the First World War. She was appointed to the Education Committee of Cambridge Borough Council in 1907, although in her first year only attended 13 of a possible 31 meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=8 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also on the committee of the newly formed League for Physical Education and Improvement, but resigned citing pressures from other workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|issue=17 May 1907|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=17 May 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the watchful eye of [[Florence Ada Keynes]] Eglantyne and Florence's daughter Margaret set up and ran the Boy's employment registry, shortly followed by a similar one for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a Blue Plaque above 82 Regent Street where the employment registry was sited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulley|first1=Clare|url=http://www.claremulley.com/blog/28-december-2014/|title=Blue Plaque-tastic!|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 she was asked to undertake a journey to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] on behalf of the Macedonian Relief Fund. She returned shortly before the First World War broke out, and soon was drawn into a project organised by Dorothy, who had begun importing European newspapers – including ones from Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] for which a special licence had to be obtained from the government – and publishing extracts in English in the ''Cambridge Magazine'', which revealed that everyday life in the enemy countries was far worse than government propaganda suggested.

As the war was coming to an end, and the German and Austro-Hungarian economies came near to collapse, it was clear to Dorothy and Eglantyne that the children of these countries were suffering appallingly from the effects of the war and the [[Blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]], which continued even when an armistice was signed. A pressure group, the Fight the Famine Council, was set up in 1919 to persuade the British government to end the blockade.

== Save the Children ==
Soon, however, the focus shifted to organising relief. On 15 April 1919, the Council set up a fund to raise money for the German and Austrian children – the [[Save the Children Fund]]. Unexpectedly, this organisation, launched at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on 19 May 1919, quickly raised a large sum of money from the British public, and officials were despatched to organise relief work.

The success of the Fund led Eglantyne and Dorothy to attempt to set up an international movement for children. The [[International Save the Children Union]] (''Union International de Secours à l'Enfant'') was founded in [[Geneva]] in 1920, with the British [[Save the Children Fund]] and the Swedish [[Rädda Barnen]] as leading members.

In London, it was now Eglantyne who was in charge, and she ensured that the Fund adopted the professional approach she had learnt in the Charity Organisation Society. A manager, Lewis Golden, was recruited to put the organisation on a businesslike foundation. He adopted the innovative – and controversial – approach of taking full-page advertisements in national newspapers; it was highly effective, and raised very substantial amounts of income for the Fund's work.

As the problems in central Europe receded, there was a new focus of the Fund's attention – a refugee crisis in [[Greece]] and the surrounding areas, a consequence of the continuing conflict in the area. Then in 1921, just as this situation was coming under control, there was a new and bigger emergency. Partly as a consequence of the devastation of war, revolution and civil war, and partly due to the disastrous economic policies of the [[Bolshevik]] government, the people of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] faced a [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] as crops failed. A new fundraising effort brought a surge of donations, and a Save the Children team was dispatched to the city of [[Saratov]], one of the main famine centres.

== Declaration of the Rights of the Child ==
In all the work the Fund did, a major element in Eglantyne's thinking was the importance of a planned, research-based approach. In 1923, when the Russian relief effort was coming to an end, and the Fund's income was sharply reducing, she turned to another issue – that of children's rights. She headed to Geneva, to a meeting of the International Union, with a plan for a Children's Charter. The result was a short and clear document – drafted by Eglantyne – which asserted the rights of children and the duty of the international community to put children's rights in the forefront of planning. The [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], or the Declaration of Geneva as it came to be known, was adopted a year later by the [[League of Nations]].

With peace returning to Europe, and relief efforts in decline, the focus of the Save the Children movement shifted to promoting the Declaration. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare congress was held in Geneva. The Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments. An expanded version would be adopted by the United Nations in 1959, and it was one of the main inspirations behind the 1989 UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Death and legacy ==
After many years of ill health due to a thyroid problem, including three operations for [[goitre]], Eglantyne Jebb died in a nursing home in Geneva in 1928, and is buried there in St George's cemetery. [[Save the Children]], which she and her sister [[Dorothy Buxton|Dorothy]] (who converted to the [[Society of Friends]] with her husband) founded in England in 1919 and as an international organisation based in Geneva the following year, remains active today. Also, the [[Church of England]] remembers her life and service annually on its [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|liturgical calendar]] on 17 December.

Since social psychologist [[Roy Baumeister]] coined the term in 2000, only two studies directly assessing erotic plasticity have been completed {{as of|2010|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Benuto"&gt;Benuto, L. (2010). ''Exploring erotic plasticity as an individual difference variable: Theory and measurement. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,'' 7263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BenutoMeana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benuto | first1 = L. | last2 = Meana | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Acculturation and sexuality: investigating gender differences in erotic plasticity | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 217–24 | pmid = 18686150 | doi=10.1080/00224490801987465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#Female erotic plasticity hypothesis|female erotic plasticity hypothesis]] states that women have higher erotic plasticity than men, and therefore their sex drives are more socially flexible and responsive than those of men (factors such as religion, culture and education have a greater effect on women's sexual behaviors). Men, on the other hand, remain relatively rigid after [[puberty]] but can still be affected by these factors.

==Female erotic plasticity hypothesis==
As women have been theorised to possess a weaker sex drive than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=R. F. |last2=Catanese |first2=K. R. |last3=Vohs |first3=K. D. |year=2001 |title=Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence |url=http://carlsonschool.umn.edu/Assets/71520.pdf |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=242–73 |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0503_5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522044854/http://carlsonschool.umn.edu/Assets/71520.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lippa 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R. A. | year = 2009 | title = Sex differences in sex drive, sociosexuality, and height across 53 nations: testing evolutionary and social structural theories | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 631–51 | pmid = 17975724 | doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may more readily accept substitutes or alternate forms of satisfaction. Baumeister theorized that weaker motivations tend to lead to greater plasticity. For example, the [[Father|paternal]] role has greater plasticity than the [[mother|maternal]] role because males have a weaker motivation in the parenting context.&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; However, a lower sex drive does not necessarily imply that sex is less important for women, or that females have a lower capacity to become aroused. Rather, Baumeister's hypothesis&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; supports the notion that women are less willing to engage in sex than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = L. M. | year = 2007 | title = The evolution of Plasticity in Female-Female Desire | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 245–274 | doi=10.1300/j056v18n04_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for female erotic plasticity===

====Culture====
According to Baumeister, the culture a woman is raised in affects her sexual attitudes and behaviours more than it would affect a man raised in the same culture. Factors such as politics, cultural and societal views on sexual behaviours would all play a role. A multinational study by Lippa (2009) found that women are more variable in their sex drives, suggesting that their sexuality is more malleable and influenced by society than men's.&lt;ref name="Lippa 2009" /&gt; Another study showed that South Korean women had a higher median age of first intercourse, lower rates of premarital sex, and greater disapproval of premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sohn | first1 = A. | last2 = Chun | first2 = S. S. | year = 2007 | title = Gender Differences in Sexual Behaviour and Condom-Related Behaviours and Attitudes among Korean Youths | url = | journal = Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 45–52 | doi=10.1177/10105395070190020801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, there are strong gender-based sexual [[double standard]]s such that women are expected to be passive and virgins at marriage. Therefore, Baumeister theorized that cultural norms have affected women's attitudes and behaviours more so than men. Another study showed that female, but not male, Hispanic immigrants to the United States were less likely to engage in vaginal, oral, and anal sex than Hispanics who had been born and raised in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = U. K. | last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. H. | year = 2009 | title = Risky Sexual Behaviours Among Hispanic Young Adults in South Florida: Nativity, Age at Immigration And Gender Differences | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 202–209 | doi=10.1363/4120209}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safe sex|Condom use]] was unaffected by whether or not the person was an immigrant, suggesting that upbringing and acculturation had a significant impact on engaging in sexual activity and not on how they would protect themselves during sex.

Baumeister predicted that [[acculturation]], the process of adopting the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the surrounding culture, should have a greater effect on the sexual behaviours and attitudes of female immigrants. However, in a study conducted by Benuto and Meana, one of the two studies conducted about erotic plasticity, supporting evidence was not found.&lt;ref name="BenutoMeana" /&gt; When examining the acculturation of college students from an American college of non-American background, acculturation had the same effect on sexual behaviours and attitudes of both men and women. Numerous potential methodological flaws of the study are indicated that may have produced this contradictory data, such as women trying to appear socially desirable in their responses (see [[social desirability bias]]) or that participants were too acculturated.

====Religion====
Catholic nuns are more successful at fulfilling their vows of [[celibacy]] and more willing to commit to their promises of sexual abstinence than male clergy, suggesting women can more easily adapt to such high non-permissive standards.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, S. (1992). ''A delicate dance: Sexuality, celibacy, and relationships among Catholic clergy and religious.'' New York: Crossroad.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on older unmarried adults found that those who were highly religious were less likely to have recently had sex compared to non-religious unmarried adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = M.

Church attendance and religiosity is also associated with lower odds of reporting masturbation among females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baćak | first1 = V. | last2 = Štulhofer | first2 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Masturbation Among Sexually Active Women in Croatia: Associations with Religiosity and Pornography Use | url = | journal = International Journal of Sexual Health | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 248–257 | doi=10.1080/19317611.2011.611220}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible explanation is that higher levels of spirituality and religiosity are associated with higher levels of sex guilt in women. One study even suggests that this differs amongst women of different culture. Religious Euro-Canadian women reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire and less sex guilt than Eastern Asian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woo | first1 = J.

Finally, Farmer and colleagues (2009) found that unreligious women are more likely to engage in unrestricted premarital intercourse behaviour than religious women. Such a difference was not demonstrated in religious and non-religious men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Trapnell | first2 = P.

=====Adolescent sexuality=====
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality|Premarital sex|Sexual abstinence}}

Religiosity can also affect whether adolescents choose to abstain from sexual conduct. Commitment to religion and having friends with similar commitments has a stronger impact on girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmer-Gembeck | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Helfand | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Ten years of longitudinal research on U.S. adolescent sexual behaviour: Development correlates of sexual intercourse, and the importance of age, gender and ethnic background | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 153–224 | doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors, such as family members’ disapproval of adolescent sexual behaviour also play a significant role.

====Heritability====
[[Heritability]] is the amount of differences between individuals that is the product of genetics. According to female erotic plasticity theory, sexual behaviours of men should be more heritable because there is a stronger biological component driving these behaviours. A study examining adult twins in Sweden found a lower genetic component for the engagement in same-sex behaviours in women than in men.&lt;ref name="Langstrom"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Långström | first1 = N. | last2 = Rahman | first2 = Q. | last3 = Carlström | first3 = E. | last4 = Lichtenstein | first4 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Genetic and Environmental Effects on Same-sex Sexual Behaviour: A Population Study of Twins in Sweden | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9386-1 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 75–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared environment also played a larger role in women's same-sex behaviours than in men's, although unique environmental factors were roughly the same. On the other hand, in their study of Australian twins, Bailey, Dunne and Martin found a concordance in sexual behaviour of 20% for male [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|MZ twins]], and of 24% for female MZ twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bailey, J. Michael |author2=Dunne, Michael P. |author3=Martin, Nicholas G. |date=March 2000|title=Genetic and environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=78|pages=524–536|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/78/3/524/|accessdate=2013-03-05|issue=3|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.3.524|pmid=10743878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another twin study showed male identical twins are more likely than female identical twins to begin having sex at the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunne | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Martin | first2 = N. G. | last3 = Statham | first3 = D. J. | last4 = Slutske | first4 = W. S. | last5 = Dinwiddie | first5 = S. H. | last6 = Bucholz | first6 = K.

====Attitude–behaviour inconsistencies====
Baumeister's 3rd prediction states that women should have greater inconsistencies between their attitudes towards sexual behaviours and whether they actually engage in said behaviours. Wives are more likely than husbands to report that they changed a "great deal" in their habits, ideas and expectations of sex over 20 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ard | first1 = B. N. | year = 1977 | title = Sex in Lasting Marriages: A Longitudinal Study | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 274–285 | doi=10.1080/00224497709550985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more husbands reported that their spouses changed than did wives. Another example is condom use, for which women in the past have demonstrated difficulty in expressing their desire to use them during sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Bird | first2 = S. T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = J. T. | last4 = Beckman | first4 = L. J. | last5 = Huszti | first5 = H.

==Gender similarities==
Although the female erotic plasticity theory states that the men's and women's sexuality are different, some evidence suggests that men's sexuality too can be affected by sociocultural factors. Although religious commitment and family member's stances on adolescent sexual behaviours have a significant impact on females' choice to abstain, to a lesser extent it affects males' choice as well.&lt;ref name="Zimmer" /&gt; Also, the fact that some male clergy are successful in maintaining their vows of celibacy suggests some degree of erotic plasticity. College education is associated with an increase in variety of sexual behaviours&lt;ref name="SH-D"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shibley Hyde | first1 = J. | last2 = Durik | first2 = A. M. | year = 2000 | title = Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity – Evolutionary or Sociocultural Forces?

Asian males and females consistently report more conservative sexual attitudes than Hispanic and Euro-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahrold | first1 = T. K. | last2 = Meston | first2 = C. M. | year = 2010 | title = Ethnic Differences in Sexual Attitudes of U.S. College Students: Gender, Acculturation, and Religiosity Factors | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9406-1 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 190–202 | pmc = 4426857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual arousal==
{{Main article|Sexual arousal}}

According to [[Meredith Chivers]], straight women are physically aroused by a greater variety of erotic images than men, and this physical arousal does not match subjective arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = M. L. | year = 2010 | title = A brief update on the specificity of sexual arousal | url = | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 407–414 | doi=10.1080/14681994.2010.495979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar results were found in a study that showed both consensual and non-consensual sex scenes to men and women. Neither men nor women reported sexual arousal to the rape scenes, but women's bodies responded in a similar way to both scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kelly D. Suschinsky |author2=Martin L. Lalumière |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/2/159.short |title=Prepared for Anything? |doi=10.1177/0956797610394660 |date=2010-12-28 |accessdate=2013-03-05 |volume=22 |journal=Psychological Science |pages=159–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual explanation for this is that women's physical arousal is an evolutionary automatic response, to prevent damage during rape.
However, a study that measured sexual arousal through pupil dilation found that physical response of lesbian and bisexual women to erotic images was more category-specific, with lesbian women showing more response to women, and bisexual women showing more response to the preferred sex than the other. This may be due to masculinization of the brain via prenatal hormones. The difference between straight and non-straight women was consistent with Chivers' findings.
The same study found also sexual fluidity in men's response, that moved along a continuum between heterosexuality and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040256 |title=The Eyes Have It: Sex and Sexual Orientation Differences in Pupil Dilation Patterns |publisher=PLoS ONE |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study by Henry E. Adams et al. showed that a significant percentage of heterosexual men, both homophobic (80%) and non-homophobic (34%), became aroused by homosexual male pornography, as well as heterosexual and lesbian, suggesting that sexual arousal in men is also fluid.&lt;ref name="my.psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://my.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf |title=Is Homophobia Associated With Homosexual Arousal? |publisher=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |year=1996 |author1=Henry E. Adams |author2=Lester W. Wright, Jr. |author3=Bethany A. Lohr |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual fluidity and same-sex behaviours==
[[Sexual fluidity]] is the concept that sexual orientation or sexuality is not rigid, but rather can change over time. According to Lisa Diamond, developer of the concept, women generally tend to be more fluid in their sexuality than men.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L. M. (2008). ''Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women’s Love and Desire.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In her study of lesbian, bisexual and unlabeled women, she found that these had a tendency of changing their sexual identities and behaviour over time.&lt;ref name="my.psychologytoday.com"/&gt; 
Other studies have shown as well greater fluidity among lesbians, compared with homosexual men. However, heterosexual men and women were equally stable in their orientation, and bisexual men and women were similarly unstable.&lt;ref&gt;http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Kinsey proposed that sexuality moves along a continuum, and it's not reduced to two extremes. In his studies he found substantial same-sex behaviour among the general population: 46% of men had reacted sexually to persons of both sexes during the course of their lives, while 36% of men and 13% of women had an overt homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', {{ISBN|978-0-253-33412-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who remained in relationships with [[Trans woman|male-to-female]] [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]] maintained a heterosexual identity, yet reported changes in their sexual lives. (Aramburu Alegría, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;Aramburu Alegría, C. (2012). Relational and sexual fluidity in females partnered with male-to-female transsexual persons. ''Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 2012 Feb 1,'' 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; Some women reported that their relationships no longer included sexual activity, while others reported that things were still changing. This suggests women are able to change their sexuality without changing their sexual orientation.
Also, according to Lippa (2006), heterosexual women with high sex drives tend to be attracted to both women and men, whereas heterosexual men with high sex drives are only associated with attraction to either women or men, suggesting greater plasticity in women's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R. A. | year = 2006 | title = Is High Sex Drive Associated With Increased Sexual Attraction to Both Sexes? It Depends on Whether You Are Male or Female | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 46–52 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although, according to Van Wyk and Geist (1984) and Dixon (1985), a high sex drive is also associated with bisexuality in men.

==Erotic plasticity and gender/sexual variation==
Lesbians are more likely than gay men to engage in heterosexual sex, suggesting greater variability in their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F. &amp; Stillman, T. (2006). Erotic Plasticity: Nature, Culture, Gender, and Sexuality. In R. D. McAnulty &amp; M. M Burnette (Eds.), ''Sex and Sexuality, Volume 1'' (pp. 343-359). Westport: Praeger Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bart, P. B. (1993). Protean women: The liquidity of female sexuality and the tenaciousness of lesbian identity. In S. Wilkinson &amp; C. Kitzinger (Eds.), ''Heterosexuality: Feminism and psychology reader'' (pp. 246-252). London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; No research has been done on people with gender variation, such as [[transgender]] people.

Little is known about erotic plasticity in [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]]. [[Sexual reassignment surgery]] and [[hormone therapy]] (i.e. [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]]) in [[Trans man|female-to-male transsexuals]] produce an increase in their sexual desire, but it is uncertain how erotic plasticity plays a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wierckx | first1 = K. | last2 = Elaut | first2 = E. | last3 = Van Caenegem | first3 = E. V. | last4 = Van De Peer | first4 = F. | last5 = Dedecker | first5 = D. | last6 = Van Houdenhove | first6 = E.

L. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation of female-to-male transsexuals: A comparison of homosexual and non-homosexual types | doi = 10.1023/a:1001915530479 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 259–278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire''==
In her Ph.D. dissertation in 2009, [[Lorraine Benuto]] attempted to create a scale measuring erotic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Benuto" /&gt; Her scale, the EPQ (''Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire''), contained the following subscales, each believed to be a component of erotic plasticity:
* Fluidity (of behaviours on the same-sex/opposite-sex continuum)
* Attitude-Behaviour Inconsistency
* Changes in Attitudes (over time)
* Perception of Choice
* Sociocultural Influence

When administered to a test population, women scored higher on fluidity, attitude-behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no significant gender differences in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister's hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, the subscales of the EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity is a much more complicated construct than initially imagined.

Contrary to the numerous studies Baumeister cites as evidence of sociocultural influences on women, Benuto did not find a gender difference on the sociocultural influence subscale. However, Baumeister's cited studies were not [[self-report study|self-report studies]], whereas Benuto's scale was, which may have contributed to the discrepancy.

==Applications in sex therapy==
Baumeister provided three applications of the theory of erotic plasticity in [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name="B2004" /&gt; Sex differences in erotic plasticity can change how therapists will approach providing sex therapy to men and women. Baumeister found that [[cognitive therapy]] would be a better approach for female patients because sexual responses and behaviours are influenced by what things mean, therefore working with women's interpretations and understanding of these responses and behaviours would be of greatest benefit. Physiological therapy, such as [[hormone therapy]], would therefore be best for male patients, since the focus would be more on the body than on the man's cognitions. Also, someone with high erotic plasticity will have less sexual self-knowledge and self-understanding than someone with low erotic plasticity since their behaviours and tastes are susceptible to change; this knowledge could be useful in helping someone perhaps confused about his or her sexual identity. Finally, prospects for successful sex therapy may be better for women than men, because if men develop a problem, their low plasticity will make it difficult to allow significant change after puberty.

Other useful applications of erotic plasticity in sex therapy include having women place much consideration in family and peer relationships, and any internal and external pressures that may be affecting their sexual identity, such as religious influences, cultural norms and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McElwain | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Grimes | first2 = M. E. | last3 = McVicker | first3 = M. L. | year = 2009 | title = The Implications of Erotic Plasticity and [[Social Constructionism]] in the Formation of Female Sexual Identity | url = | journal = Journal of Feminist Family Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 125–139 | doi=10.1080/08952830902911347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and alternate explanations==
Baumeister's theory of female erotic plasticity has been met with some criticism. Some argue Baumeister makes causal inferences from correlational research when discussing how education affects men and women differently.&lt;ref name="SH-D" /&gt; He was also criticized for his use of extreme groups to support his predictions, such as people of the least and most amount of education.&lt;ref name="SH-D" /&gt; Below are two posited alternate explanations of erotic plasticity:

===Shibley Hyde and Durik===
In a 2000 paper, [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] and Amanda M. Durik argued that a more sociocultural explanation could be used to explain erotic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Hyde &amp; Durik, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|author2=Durik, Amanda M.|title=Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity – Evolkutionary or Sociocultural Forces? Comment on Baumeister (2000)|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2000|volume=126|issue=3|pages=375–379|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.375|pmid=10825780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, education does not affect men's and women's sexual behaviour differently. Instead, it increases women's power, therefore women with the greatest amount of education are nearly equal in power with men. On the other hand, women who are the least educated have the least power relative to men. When comparing sexual behaviours of most educated and least educated men and women, they found that education actually increased the prevalence of many sexual activities in both sexes, including oral sex, anal sex, and having a same sex partner. The differences between men and women were much smaller in the most educated group than in the least educated group. Shibley Hyde and Durik speculate that more educated women are better at communicating their desires and have enough self-confidence to do so. They also may perform a greater variety of sexual activities because of their greater exposure to ideas and their commitment to learning.

Shibley Hyde and Durik also asserted that religion has a greater effect on women's sexual behaviours because a group with less power – in this case, women – will shape their behaviour to be more like the group with power, in this case, men. Therefore, women pay more attention to and conform more to religious teachings since it is the culture to which they must adapt. They back up this claim by presenting evidence that non-religious women and men are similar in the prevalence of all sexual activities, minus masturbation. On the contrary, Conservative Protestant men and women differed significantly in all sexual behaviours.

They also argued for a modern sexual double standard that is more restrictive of female sexuality than male sexuality. They claimed that now, extramarital sex is more tolerated in women than in the past, but it is still less acceptable in women than in men. Therefore, these different gender roles will exert powerful influences on both men's and women's behaviour and sexuality. Finally, they claim that the greater evidence for attitude-behaviour inconsistency in women is not the result of high erotic plasticity, but because of men's greater interpersonal power. Although women may, for example, have the intention of using condoms or have negative attitudes towards anal sex, men may use their greater power to do what it is they desire if it differs from what their partner wants.

===Benuto===
Benuto (2009) argues that heightened fluidity and sociocultural influences, two components of erotic plasticity, actually stand in opposition to each other. Although scientific evidence exists that women's sexual behaviours are indeed more fluid than men's, Benuto argues there is nothing in society that would encourage women to engage in same-sex behaviour. She hypothesizes that, based on the properties of her EPQ scale (Benuto, 2009),&lt;ref name="Benuto" /&gt; erotic plasticity may not be a unitary construct like Baumeister initially proposed, and that there perhaps may be multiple “plasticities”, each composed of different constructs. Such constructs include sociocultural influences, [[locus of control]] and changes of sexual attitudes over time. Finally, it is possible that the heightened attitude-behaviour inconsistency in women could either be due to the powerlessness of women, or women wanting to maintain harmony and nurturance in their relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7452">'''Ethnic history''' is a branch of [[social history]] that studies ethnic groups and immigrants. Barman (2007) argues that the field allows historians to use alternate models of interpretation, unite qualitative and quantitative data, apply sociological models to historical patterns, examine more deeply macro-level policies and decisions, and, especially, empathize with the ethnic groups under study.

==Defining the field==
Ethnic history is especially important in the U.S. and Canada. [[Oscar Handlin]] (b. 1915), the director of scores of PhD dissertations at Harvard University was an important pioneer and sponsor of ethnic historiography. Handlin's Pulitzer-prize-winning interpretation, ''[[The Uprooted]]'' (1951) was highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handler and Mary F. Handler, "The New History and the Ethnic Factor in American Life," ''Perspectives in American History,'' 1970, Vol. 4, pp 5-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Major encyclopedias have helped define the field; Handler sponsored one published by Harvard University Press in 1980 that received wide media attention because it tied in with an American interest in their roots.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perin (1983) looks at the historiography of Canadian ethnic history and finds two alternative methodologies. One is more static and emphasizes how closely immigrant cultures replicate the Old World. This approach tends to be filiopietistic. The alternative approach has been influenced by the recent historiography on labor, urban, and family history.

McDonald|McDonald]] (2007) identifies five main areas of interest for scholarship on U.S. ethnic history: the origins and meaning of ethnicity, particularly the issue of whether it is inherited or invented; the origins of ethnic diversity (such as conquest, immigration, involuntary migration); models of ethnic adaptation (especially the [[Melting pot|Melting Pot]], [[Cultural mosaic|mosaic]], [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] and kaleidoscope metaphors); ethnic incorporation into the social, economic, and political fabric of the receiving country; and minority group survival strategies, including responses to competing forms of allegiance like class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Jason McDonald. ''American Ethnic History: Themes and Perspectives''. (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research is done by reading the letters immigrants wrote to relatives back home, often comparing the advantages and disadvantages of their new lives.&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Kamphoefner, "Immigrant Epistolary and Epistemology: On the Motivators and Mentality of Nineteenth-Century German Immigrants." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2009): 34-54. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40543427 in JSTOR], on deep-reading their letters&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant trend has been to integrate ethnic history with other new historiographical tendencies, such as [[Atlantic history]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[labor history (discipline)|labor history]] or [[women's history]].

Since he did not talk, look, or act like a slave (in the eyes of Northern audiences), Douglass was denounced as an imposter."&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass wrote several autobiographies. He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography, ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]''. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, it covered events during and after the Civil War. Douglass also actively supported [[women's suffrage]], and held several public offices. Without his approval, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States [[United States presidential election, 1872|as the running mate and Vice Presidential nominee of]] [[Victoria Woodhull]], on the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] ticket.&lt;ref name=VP/&gt;

Douglass was a firm believer in the [[Egalitarianism|equality]] of all peoples, whether [[African Americans|black]], [[Woman|female]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], or recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]]. He was also a believer in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, and in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution. When radical abolitionists, under the motto "No Union With Slaveholders", criticized Douglass' willingness to dialogue with slave owners, he famously replied: "I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong."&lt;ref name=uniteQuote&gt;{{Cite book

==Life as a slave==
Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Talbot County, Maryland]]. The plantation was between [[Hillsboro, Maryland|Hillsboro]]&lt;ref name="Narrative" /&gt; and [[Cordova, Maryland|Cordova]]; his birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin{{efn|"The old cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads upstairs, and its clay floor downstairs, and its dirt chimney, and windowless sides, ... was MY HOME – the only home I ever had; and I loved it, and all connected with it.

}}&lt;br /&gt;Frederick Douglass began his own story thus: "I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland." (Tuckahoe is not a town; it refers to the area west of the creek in Talbot County.) In successive autobiographies, Douglass gave more precise estimates of when he was born, his final estimate being 1817. He adopted February 14 as his birthday because his mother Harriet Bailey used to call him her "little [[Valentine's Day|valentine]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slaves were punished for learning to read or write, and so could not keep records. Based on the extant records of Douglass's former owner, Aaron Anthony, historian [[Dickson Preston]] determined that Douglass was born in February 1818. McFeely, 1991, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass was of mixed race, which likely included Native American and African on his mother's side, as well as European.&lt;ref name=pbs-WGBH&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Black? One Nation's Definition|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html|work=Frontline |publisher=WGBH |accessdate=November 27, 2015|ref=pbs-WGBH}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was "almost certainly white," as shown by historian [[David W. Blight]] in his 2018 biography of Douglass.&lt;ref name="gopnik76"&gt;Adam Gopnik, "American Prophet", ''The New Yorker'', 15 October 2018, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He said his mother Harriet Bailey gave him his grand name. After escaping to the North years later, he took the surname [[Douglass family|Douglass]], having already dropped his two middle names.

He later wrote of his earliest times with his mother:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The opinion was ... whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion I know nothing ... My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant ... It [was] common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. ... I do not recollect ever seeing my mother by the light of day. ... She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave.

After this early separation from his mother, young Frederick lived with his maternal grandmother, Betty Bailey. At the age of six, he was separated from his grandmother and moved to the [[Wye House]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hstc.org/museum-gardens/frederick-douglass|title="Frederick Douglass", The Historical Society of Talbot County, Maryland|access-date=December 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222223221/http://www.hstc.org/museum-gardens/frederick-douglass|archive-date=December 22, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass's mother died when he was about ten. After Anthony died, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas' brother Hugh Auld in [[Baltimore]]. He felt himself lucky to be in the city, where he said slaves were almost freemen, compared to those on plantations.&lt;ref name="gopnik76"/&gt;
{{Slavery}}
When Douglass was about twelve, Hugh Auld's wife Sophia started teaching him the [[alphabet]]. Douglass described her as a kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him "as she supposed one human being ought to treat another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave. Written by himself| chapter = Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage slaves to desire freedom; Douglass later referred to this as the "first decidedly antislavery lecture" he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick. ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass: His Early Life as a Slave, His Escape from Bondage, and His Complete History'', p. 50. Dover Value Editions, Courier Dover Publications, 2003. {{ISBN|0-486-43170-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under her husband's influence, Sophia came to believe that education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Douglass | first = Frederick | title = Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave.

Douglass continued, secretly, to teach himself how to read and write. He later often said, "knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, H. and Appiah, K. (2004). ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave &amp; Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.'' pp. xiii, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited ''[[The Columbian Orator]]'', an anthology that he discovered at about age twelve, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. The book, first published in 1797, is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar.

When Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he taught other slaves on the plantation to read the [[New Testament]] at a weekly [[Sunday school]]. As word spread, the interest among slaves in learning to read was so great that in any week, more than 40 slaves would attend lessons. For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed. While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated. One Sunday they burst in on the gathering, armed with clubs and stones, to disperse the congregation permanently.

In 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh ("[a]s a means of punishing Hugh," Douglass later wrote). Thomas Auld sent Douglass to work for [[Edward Covey]], a poor farmer who had a reputation as a "slave-breaker". He whipped Douglass regularly, and nearly broke him psychologically. The sixteen-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings, however, and fought back. After Douglass won a physical confrontation, Covey never tried to beat him again.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Jerome.

==From slavery to freedom==
Douglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him out from his owner [[Edward Lloyd (Governor of Maryland)|Colonel Lloyd]], but was unsuccessful. In 1836, he tried to escape from his new master Covey, but failed again. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with [[Anna Murray-Douglass|Anna Murray]], a [[Free people of color|free black]] woman in Baltimore about five years older than he. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;
[[File:Anna Murray-Douglass (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Anna Murray-Douglass]], Douglass's wife for 44 years, portrait ca. 1860.]]
On September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a train from the newly merged [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (P.W.&amp; B.) railroad line to the great Northern cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The area where he boarded was a short distance east of the previous temporary P.W.&amp; B. train depot in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of [[Harbor East]] and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]]. The depot was located at President and Fleet streets, east of [[Inner Harbor|"The Basin"]] of the [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore harbor]], on the Northwest Branch of the [[Patapsco River]]. (This depot was replaced by the historic [[President Street Station]], constructed 1849–1850; it was noted as a site of other slave escapes along one of many routes of the famous "[[Underground Railroad]]" and during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].)

Young Douglass reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], in the northeast corner of the state, along the southwest shore of the [[Susquehanna River]], which flowed into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Although this placed him some 20 miles from the free state of Pennsylvania, it was easier to travel through Delaware, another slave state.

Frederick Douglass later wrote of his arrival in New York City:

{{quote|I have often been asked, how I felt when first I found myself on free soil. And my readers may share the same curiosity. There is scarcely anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A new world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath, and the 'quick round of blood,' I lived more in one day than in a year of my slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely describe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: 'I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions.' Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8ILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |page=170 |accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once Douglass had arrived, he sent for Murray to follow him north to New York. She brought with her the necessary basics for them to set up a home. They were married on September 15, 1838, by a black [[Presbyterian]] minister, just eleven days after Douglass had reached New York.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SouthCoast /&gt; At first, they adopted Johnson as their married name, to divert attention.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA124" /&gt;

Douglass thought of joining a white Methodist Church but from the beginning, he was disappointed when he saw it was segregated. Later he joined the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], an independent [[black church|black denomination]] first established in New York City, which counted among its members [[Sojourner Truth]] and [[Harriet Tubman]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice S. Lee (2009), ''The Cambridge Companion to Frederick Douglass''. Cambridge University Press, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a licensed preacher in 1839,&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/frederick_douglass.html|title=This Far by Faith. Frederick Douglass |publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this helped him hone his oratorical skills. He held various positions, including steward, Sunday School superintendent, and sexton. In 1840, Douglass delivered a speech in [[Elmira, New York]], then a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. (Years later, a black congregation formed there and by 1940 it became the region's largest church.)&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"&gt;[http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass/ "Religious Facts You Might Not Know about Frederick Douglass"], ''Religion News'', 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass also joined several organizations in New Bedford, and regularly attended abolitionist meetings. He subscribed to [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s weekly journal ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. Inspired by Garrison, Douglass later said, "no face and form ever impressed me with such sentiments [of the hatred of slavery] as did those of William Lloyd Garrison." So deep was this influence that in his last biography, Douglass confessed "his paper took a place in my heart second only to The Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass (2008). ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass''. Cosimo, Inc. p. 149 {{ISBN|9781605203997}} (first published in 1881).&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison was likewise impressed with Douglass, and had written about his anti-colonialism stance in ''The Liberator'' as early as 1839. In 1841, Douglass first heard Garrison speak at a meeting of the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later Douglass spoke at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in [[Nantucket]]. Then 23 years old, Douglass conquered his nervousness and gave an eloquent speech about his rough life as a slave.

While living in Lynn, Douglass engaged in early protest against the segregation in transportation. In September 1841 at [[Lynn station|Lynn Central Square station]], Douglass and friend [[James N. Buffum]] were thrown off an [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] train because Douglass refused to sit in the segregated railroad coach.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.civilrightsteaching.org/desegregation/transportation-protests/ |title=Transportation Protests: 1841 to 1992 |website=www.civilrightsteaching.org |language=en |access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://primaryresearch.org/resistance-to-the-segregation-of-public-transportation-in-the-early-1840s/ |title=Resistance to the Segregation of Public Transportation in the Early 1840’s |website=primaryresearch.org |language=en |access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikisource-inline|Page:My Bondage and My Freedom (1855).djvu/411 |single=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, Douglass joined other speakers in the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]'s "Hundred Conventions" project, a six-month tour at meeting halls throughout the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]]. During this tour, slavery supporters frequently accosted Douglass. At a lecture in [[Pendleton, Indiana]], an angry mob chased and beat Douglass before a local Quaker family, the Hardys, rescued him. His hand was broken in the attack; it healed improperly and bothered him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Times of Frederick Douglass |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8ILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |pages=287–88 |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stone marker in Falls Park in the [[Pendleton Historic District (Pendleton, Indiana)|Pendleton Historic District]] commemorates this event.

===Autobiography===
Douglass's best-known work is his first autobiography ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', written during his time in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.itemlive.com/2018/02/02/re-examining-fredrick-douglasss-time-lynn/ |title=Re-Examining Fredrick Douglass's Time In Lynn |publisher=Lynn Daily Item / itemlive.com |accessdate=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and published in Europe.

Douglass published three versions of his autobiography during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 ''Narrative'' was his biggest seller, and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]''. In 1881, after the Civil War, Douglass published ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]'', which he revised in 1892.

===Travels to Ireland and Great Britain===
[[File:Unidentified Artist - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project-restore.png|215px|thumb|Douglass in 1847, around 29 years of age]]
Douglass' friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his "property" back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the ''Cambria'' for [[Liverpool]] on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] was beginning.

The feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. I breathe, and lo! the chattel [slave] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlour—I dine at the same table—and no one is offended ... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, {{'}}''We don't allow niggers in here!''{{'}}&lt;ref name="My Bondage"&gt;Frederick Douglass, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]: Part I – Life as a Slave, Part II – Life as a Freeman'', with an introduction by James M'Cune Smith.

Douglass spent two years in Ireland and Great Britain, where he gave many lectures in churches and chapels. His draw was such that some facilities were "crowded to suffocation". One example was his hugely popular ''London Reception Speech'', which Douglass delivered in May 1846 at [[Alexander Fletcher (minister)|Alexander Fletcher's]] [[Finsbury Chapel]]. Douglass remarked that in England he was treated not "as a color, but as a man."&lt;ref name="Ruuth"&gt;Marianne Ruuth (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lx8nXxmAlcC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=Douglass%20-%20england%20-%20not%20%22as%20a%20color%2C%20but%20as%20a%20man Frederick Douglass], pp.&amp;nbsp;117–18. Holloway House Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Douglass met with [[Thomas Clarkson]], one of the last living British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]], who had persuaded Parliament to abolish slavery in Great Britain's colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], ''[[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]]'', New York: HarperCollins, 2006, pp. 415–21.&lt;/ref&gt; During this trip Douglass became legally free, as British supporters led by [[Anna Richardson (abolitionist)|Anna Richardson]] and her sister-in-law Ellen of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] raised funds to buy his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld.&lt;ref name="Ruuth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Return to the United States===
[[File:Frederick Douglass by Samuel J Miller, 1847-52.png|thumb|Douglass circa 1847–52, around his early 30s]]
After returning to the U.S. in 1847, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|North Star]]'', from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2013/06/19/5-religious-facts-you-might-not-know-about-frederick-douglass|title=5 religious facts you might not know about Frederick Douglass|work=Religion News Service|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''North Star'''s motto was "Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren." The AME Church and ''North Star'' vigorously opposed the mostly white [[American Colonization Society]] and its proposal to send blacks back to Africa. This and Douglass's later abolitionist newspapers were mainly funded by English supporters, who gave Douglass five hundred pounds to use as he chose.&lt;ref name="Ruuth"/&gt; Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the ''North Star'' competed with Garrison's ''[[National Anti-Slavery Standard]]'' and Marius Robinson's ''Anti-Slavery Bugle''.

Douglass also came to consider Garrison too radical. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. But, [[Lysander Spooner]] published ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1846), which explored the [[United States Constitution]] as an anti-slavery document. Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fanuzzi, "Frederick Douglass' 'Colored Newspaper': Identity Politics in Black and White," in ''The Black Press: New Literary and Historical Essays'', edited by Todd Vogel (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2001), pp. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1848, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and enquiring after members of his family still held by Auld.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglass1848"/&gt; In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he would feel if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619–1895: from the colonial period to the age of Frederick Douglass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-y0OAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=February 2, 2011|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=104–05|isbn=978-0-19-516777-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglass1848"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/02/i-am-your-fellow-man-but-not-your-slave.html|title=I am your fellow man, but not your slave |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
In 1848, Douglass was the only African American to attend the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, in upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/seneca_falls |title=Seneca Falls Convention |publisher=Virginia Memory |date=August 18, 1920 |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 1997, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;USConstitution.net. [http://www.usconstitution.net/sentiments.html Text of the "Declaration of Sentiments", and the Resolutions]. Retrieved on April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers [[James Mott|James]] and [[Lucretia Mott]].&lt;ref name=McMillen93/&gt; Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could not also claim that right. He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere.

{{quote|In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.&lt;ref name=McMillen93&gt;McMillen, 2008, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Douglass's powerful words, the attendees passed the resolution.&lt;ref name=McMillen93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. Women's Rights. [http://www.nps.gov/wori/historyculture/report-of-the-womans-rights-convention.htm Report of the Woman's Rights Convention, July 19–20, 1848]. Retrieved April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial spot in his paper, the North Star, to press the case for women's rights in this public venue. The article was two-fold: it recalled the "marked ability and dignity" of the proceedings and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.

On the first count, Douglass acknowledged the "decorum" of the participants in the face of disagreement. The latter half discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and his own discussion of the "infant" feminist cause. Strikingly, he expressed the belief that "[a] discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency ... than would be a discussion of the rights of women," and Douglass noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.

His opinion as the prominent editor of the paper likely carried weight, and he stated the position of the North Star explicitly: "[w]e hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man." This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, "right is of no sex."

Later, after the Civil War when the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] to give freedmen and free blacks the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for [[universal suffrage]], and opposed any bill that split the issues.&lt;ref name="DouglassO'Meally2003"/&gt; Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.&lt;ref name="Foner, p.600"&gt;Foner, p.  600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote.&lt;ref name="Foner, p.600"/&gt; Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTV8OsmDQPcC&amp;pg=PA138 |page=138 |title=The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia |last=Watkins |first=Valetha |chapter=National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) |editor=Julius E.

===Douglass refines his ideology===
[[File:Motto frederick douglass 2.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass in 1856, around 38 years of age]]

Meanwhile, in 1851, Douglass merged the ''North Star'' with [[Gerrit Smith]]'s ''Liberty Party Paper'' to form ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', which was published until 1860.

On July 5, 1852, Douglass delivered an address to the ladies of the Rochester Anti-Slavery Sewing Society. This speech eventually became known as "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"; one biographer called it "perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William S. McFeely|title=Frederick Douglass|date=1991|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0393634112|format=hardcover|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester. His was one of 5 names attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, ''The Claims of Our Common Cause'', along with [[Amos Noë Freeman]], [[James Monroe Whitfield]], [[Henry O. Wagoner]], and [[George Boyer Vashon]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick. Frederick Douglass: Selected speeches and writings. Chicago Review Press, 2000. pp. 260–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.

On March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[George DeBaptiste]], and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Underground Railroad, US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center. Diane Publishing, February 1, 1995, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass met Brown again, when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on [[Harpers Ferry Armory|the federal armory]] in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]]. However, Douglass disapproved of Brown's plan to start an armed [[slave rebellion]] in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Douglass believed that attacking federal property would enrage the American public. After the raid, Douglass fled for a time to Canada, fearing guilt by association as well as arrest as a co-conspirator. Years later, Douglass shared a stage in Harpers Ferry with [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]], the prosecutor who secured Brown's conviction and execution.

In March 1860, while Douglass was once again traveling in England, his youngest daughter Annie died in [[Rochester, New York]]. Douglass sailed back from England the following month, traveling through Canada to avoid detection.

====Photography====
Douglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white, as photographs were an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views.&lt;ref name="Picturing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Stauffer|author2=Zoe Trodd|author3=Celeste-Marie Bernie|author4=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|author5=Kenneth B.

==Religious views==
As a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the Bible. In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Conyers &amp; Dawson (2009). ''The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul. 2006. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619–1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass Three-volume Set''. Oxford University Press. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He described this approach in his last biography, ''Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to "cast all my care upon God." This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Frederick (1882); ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass: From 1817–1882''. 3rd edition by John Lobb. Christian Age Office. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Douglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy&lt;ref name="lib.rochester.edu"&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2945], University of Rochester Frederick Douglass Project. Retrieved on November 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and accused slaveholders of ''[[wickedness]]'', lack of morality, and failure to follow the [[Golden Rule]]. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the "Christianity of Christ" and the "Christianity of America" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented "wolves in sheep's clothing".&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, 2006. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See his lecture: ''Love of God, Love of Man, Love of Country''. Delivered at Market Hall, New York City October 22, 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, in a famous oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a ''[[blasphemy]]'' when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was "one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church "stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form", and "an abomination in the sight of God". Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, [[Ichabod Spencer]], and [[Orville Dewey]], he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that "we ought to obey man's law before the law of God". He further asserted, "in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... [[Henry Ward Beecher]] of Brooklyn, [[Samuel J. May]] of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]". He maintained that "upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains". In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, "let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds."&lt;ref name="lib.rochester.edu"/&gt;

During his visits to the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American Churches that permitted slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Conyers &amp; Dawson (2009). The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.

On his return to the United States, Douglass founded the ''North Star'', a weekly publication with the motto "Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren." Douglass later wrote a letter to his former slaveholder, in which he denounced him for leaving Douglass's family illiterate:

{{quote|Your wickedness and cruelty committed in this respect on your fellow creatures, are greater than all the stripes you have laid upon my back or theirs. It is an outrage upon the soul, a war upon the immortal spirit, and one for which you must give account at the bar of our common Father and Creator.|Letter to His Old Master. To my Old Master Thomas Auld.&lt;ref name="My Bondage" /&gt;}}

Davis (2005). ''Frederick Douglass: A Precursor of Liberation Theology''. Voices of the African diaspora. Mercer University Press. {{ISBN|9780865549258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass was a deeply spiritual man, as his home continues to show. The fireplace mantle features busts of two of his favorite philosophers, [[David Friedrich Strauss]], author of "The Life of Jesus", and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], author of "The Essence of Christianity". In addition to several Bibles and books about various religions in the library, images of angels and Jesus are displayed, as well as interior and exterior photographs of Washington's [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"/&gt; Throughout his life, Douglass had linked that individual experience with social reform, and like other Christian abolitionists, he followed practices such as abstaining from tobacco, alcohol and other substances that he believed corrupted body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-stauffer/frederick-douglass-the-prophet_b_2425712.html | work=Huffington Post | first=John | last=Stauffer | title=What Every American Should Know About Frederick Douglass, Abolitionist Prophet | date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War years==
===Before the Civil War===
By the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as [[women's rights]]. His eloquence gathered crowds at every location. His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.

===Fight for emancipation and suffrage===
[[File:Men of Color Civil War Recruitment Broadside 1863.png|thumb|1863 Broadside listing Douglass as a speaker calling men of color to arms]]
Douglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. In August 1861, Douglass published an account of the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] that noted that there were some blacks already in the Confederate ranks.&lt;ref name="Black Confederates"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/black-confederates/|title= Black Confederates}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Douglass brought the subject up again, quoting a witness to the battle who said they saw black Confederates "with muskets on their shoulders and bullets in their pockets."&lt;ref name="Black Confederates"/&gt; Douglass conferred with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1863 on the treatment of black soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; and with President [[Andrew Johnson]] on the subject of black [[suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which took effect on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory.&lt;ref&gt;Slaves in Union-held areas were not covered by this war-measures act.&lt;/ref&gt; (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with the adoption of the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries."&lt;ref name="thecivilwaryears-thefightforemancipation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html|title=The Fight For Emancipation|accessdate=April 19, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708000612/http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part4.html|archivedate=July 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1864|U.S. Presidential Election of 1864]], Douglass supported [[John C. Frémont#Presidential candidate Radical Democracy Party 1864|John C. Frémont]], who was the candidate of the abolitionist [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]]. Douglass was disappointed that President Lincoln did not publicly endorse [[suffrage]] for black freedmen. Douglass believed that since African-American men were fighting for the Union in the American Civil War, they deserved the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the North no longer obliged to return slaves to their owners in the South, Douglass fought for equality for his people. He made plans with Lincoln to move liberated slaves out of the South. During the war, Douglass also helped the Union cause by serving as a recruiter for the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]]. His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, but was ill for much of his service.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of [[Fort Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;William S. McFeely, ''Frederick Douglass'' (New York: W. W. Norton, 1991), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.

===After Lincoln's death===
The post-war (1865) ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] outlawed slavery. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] provided for citizenship and equal protection under the law. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race.&lt;ref name="DouglassO'Meally2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick Douglass|author2=Robert G. O'Meally|title=Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIwdPfWvjMC&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=February 1, 2011|date=November 30, 2003|publisher=Spark Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-59308-041-9|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1876, Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the [[Emancipation Memorial]] in Washington's Lincoln Park. In that speech, Douglass spoke frankly about Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln "the white man's president", Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination. But Douglass also asked, "Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed [[Emancipation Proclamation|the first day of January 1863]], when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=39 |title=Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln by Frederick Douglass|publisher=Teaching American History |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass also said: "Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery ..."

The crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln's widow [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]] supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite [[walking-stick]] to Douglass in appreciation. That walking-stick still rests in Douglass's final residence, "Cedar Hill", now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

==Reconstruction era==
[[File:George Kendall Warren - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Douglass in 1876, around 58 years of age]]

After the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African-Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Freedman's Savings Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass also became chargé d'affaires for the Dominican Republic, but resigned that position after two years because of disagreements with U.S. government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, G. Pope. ''The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism'', University of Georgia Press, 1998, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, white insurgents had quickly arisen in the South after the war, organizing first as secret [[vigilante]] groups, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as "the military arm of the Democratic Party", turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 10 years after the end of the war, Democrats regained political power in every state of the former Confederacy and began to reassert white supremacy. They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing [[racial segregation|segregation]] and a concerted effort to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12–13, accessed March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to combat these efforts, Douglass supported the presidential campaign of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]]. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the ''New National Era'', attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; President Grant sent a Congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate if the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South allowing [[African Americans]] their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, however, Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who opposed annexation, stating if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would "regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent."&lt;ref name="Brands 2012a"&gt;Brands (2012), ''The Man Who Saved the Union Ulysses S Grant In War and Peace'', p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2000-2008 17th Street, NW.JPG|thumb|left|Douglass' former residence in the [[U Street Corridor]] of Washington, D.C. He built 2000–2004 17th Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|N.W.]], in 1875.]]

After the midterm elections, Grant signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (also known as the Klan Act), and the second and third [[Enforcement Acts]]. Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites, but earned Douglass's praise. An associate of Douglass wrote of Grant that African Americans "will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services."

In 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as [[Victoria Woodhull]]'s running mate on the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] ticket. He was nominated without his knowledge. Douglass neither campaigned for the ticket nor acknowledged that he had been nominated.&lt;ref name=VP&gt;{{cite book

However, in early June of that year, Douglass' home on South Avenue in Rochester, New York, burned down; arson was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;''Democrat and Chronicle'' (Rochester, New York), June 3, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Daily Union and Advertiser'' (Rochester, New York), June 3, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; There was extensive damage to the house, its furnishings, and the grounds; in addition, sixteen volumes of the ''North Star'' and ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'' were lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Daily Union and Advertiser'' (Rochester, New York), June 17, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass then moved to Washington, D.C.

Throughout the Reconstruction era, Douglass continued speaking, and emphasized the importance of work, voting rights and actual exercise of suffrage. Douglass's stump speech for 25 years after the end of the Civil War emphasized work to counter the racism that was then prevalent in unions.&lt;ref&gt;Olasky, Marvin. "History turned right side up". ''World magazine''. February 13, 2010. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered on November 15, 1867, Douglass said: "A man's rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box and the cartridge box. Let no man be kept from the ballot box because of his color. Let no woman be kept from the ballot box because of her sex."&lt;ref name=auken&gt;{{cite book

==Family life==
[[File:Douglass Helen Eva Frederick.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass after 1884 with his second wife [[Helen Pitts Douglass]] (sitting). The woman standing is her sister Eva Pitts.]]
Douglass and [[Anna Murray-Douglass|Anna]] had five children: [[Rosetta Douglass]], [[Lewis Henry Douglass]], Frederick Douglass Jr., [[Charles Remond Douglass]], and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.

Anna Douglass remained a loyal supporter of her husband's public work. His relationships with [[Julia Griffiths]] and [[Ottilie Assing]], two women with whom he was professionally involved, caused recurring speculation and scandals.&lt;ref name="ThompsonConyers2010PA125"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julius Eric Thompson|author2=James L.

After Anna died in 1882, in 1884 Douglass married again, to [[Helen Pitts Douglass|Helen Pitts]], a white suffragist and abolitionist from [[Honeoye, New York]]. Pitts was the daughter of [[Gideon Pitts Jr]]., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass. A graduate of [[Mount Holyoke College]] (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named ''Alpha'' while living in Washington, D.C. She later worked as Douglass's secretary.&lt;ref name="gopnik"/&gt;

Their marriage provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger than Douglass. Her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage a repudiation of their mother. But feminist [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] congratulated the couple.&lt;ref name="winningthevote"&gt;[http://winningthevote.org/FDouglass.html Frederick Douglass biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211042543/http://winningthevote.org/FDouglass.html |date=February 11, 2006 }} at winningthevote.org.

==Final years in Washington, D.C.==

Hayes]] was elected President, Douglass accepted an appointment as [[United States Marshal]] for the [[District of Columbia]], which helped assure his family's financial security.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass House.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site|Cedar Hill]]'', Douglass' house in the [[Anacostia Historic District|Anacostia]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., is preserved as a [[List of areas in the United States National Park System#National historic sites|National Historic Site]].]]

In 1877, Douglass visited Thomas Auld, who was by then on his deathbed, and the two men reconciled. Douglass had met Auld's daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior; she had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass' speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2006-105" /&gt;

That same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family's final home in Washington D.C., on a hill above the [[Anacostia River]]. He and Anna named it ''Cedar Hill'' (also spelled ''CedarHill''). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms, and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15&amp;nbsp;acres (61,000&amp;nbsp;m²). The home is now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].

In 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass''. That year he was appointed as [[Recorder of Deeds]] for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray-Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist [[Ida B. Wells]]. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.

Douglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With his new wife, Helen, Douglass traveled to England, Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt and Greece from 1886 to 1887. Douglass also became known for advocating [[Irish Home Rule]] and supported [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in Ireland.

Many African Americans, called [[Exoduster]]s, escaped the Klan and racially discriminatory laws in the South by moving to [[Kansas]], where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the [[Back-to-Africa movement]]. He thought the latter resembled the [[American Colonization Society]] which he had opposed in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop [[Henry McNeal Turner]], Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely 1991, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilkerson, Isabel]], ''[[The Warmth of Other Suns]]'' (2010), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Benjamin Harrison|Harrison]] appointed Douglass as the United States's minister resident and [[consul-general]] to the [[Republic of Haiti]] and [[Chargé d'affaires]] for [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] in 1889,&lt;ref name=sears&gt;

In 1892, Douglass constructed rental housing for blacks, now known as [[Douglass Place]], in the [[Fells Point]] area of Baltimore. The complex still exists, and in 2003 was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2008a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=764}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=November 21, 2008|work= Douglass Place, Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a massive heart attack.&lt;ref name="frederick-douglass-heritage.org"/&gt; He was 77.

His funeral was held at the [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Thousands of people passed by his coffin to show their respect. Although Douglass had attended several churches in the nation's capital, he had a pew here and donated two standing candelabras when this church had moved to a new building in 1886. He also gave many lectures there, including his last major speech, "The Lesson of the Hour."&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"/&gt;

Douglass' coffin was transported back to [[Rochester, New York]], where he had lived for 25 years, longer than anywhere else in his life. He was buried next to Anna in the Douglass family plot of [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester|Mount Hope Cemetery]], and Helen joined them in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|7407760|Anna Murray Douglass (1813–1882)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|7407772|Helen Pitts Douglass (1838–1903)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freethought-trail.org/site.php?By=SiteType&amp;Page=3&amp;Site=50|title=The Freethought Trail|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Finkenbine argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!&lt;ref&gt;Roy E. Finkenbine. [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00186.html "Douglass, Frederick"], ''American National Biography Online'', 2000. Accessdate: March 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Episcopal Church (USA)]] remembers Douglass annually on its [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar]] for February 20, the anniversary of his death. Many public schools have also been named in his honor. Douglass still has living descendants today, such as Ken Morris, who is also a descendant of [[Booker T. Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-of-abolitionist-frederick-douglass-continues-his-legacy/|title=Family of abolitionist Frederick Douglass continues his legacy|author=Axelrod, Jim|date=June 19, 2013|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other honors and remembrances, organized chronologically, include:

'''Freedom of panorama''' ('''FOP''') is  a provision in the [[copyright]] laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking photographs and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and other art works which are permanently located in a [[public place]], without infringing on any copyright that may otherwise subsist in such works, and the publishing of such images.&lt;ref name="seiler"&gt;Seiler, D.: ''[http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html Gebäudefotografie in der EU – Neues vom Hundertwasserhaus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160856/http://www.fotorecht.de/publikationen/hundertwasserhaus3.html |date=2007-09-30 }}'', in ''Photopresse'' 1/2 (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;16.

It is an exception to the normal rule that the copyright owner has the exclusive right to authorize the creation and distribution of [[derivative work]]s. The phrase is derived from the [[German language|German]] term ''{{lang|de|Panoramafreiheit}}'' ("panorama freedom").

==Laws around the world==
Many countries have similar provisions restricting the scope of copyright law in order to explicitly permit photographs involving scenes of public places or scenes photographed from public places. Other countries, though, differ widely in their interpretation of the principle.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt;

In [[Romania]], the heirs of [[Anca Petrescu]], the architect of the colossal [[Palace of the Parliament]], sued the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] for selling photos and other [[Souvenir|souvenirs]] with the image of the iconic building. The [[copyright infringement]] trial is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dpvue.com/2018/10/taking-photos-of-palace-of-parliament.html|title=Why taking photos of the Palace of the Parliament can be considered illegal|work=dpvue|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Since 7 October 2016, article L122-5 of the French Code of Intellectual Property provides for a limited freedom of panorama for works of architecture and sculpture.  The code authorizes "reproductions and representations of works of architecture and sculpture, placed permanently in public places (''voie publique''), and created by [[natural person]]s, with the exception of any usage of a commercial character".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=5DD8F8800CB25AA883378CE851D89A7D.tpdila13v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000033219336&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 5, section 11  of Code on Intellectual Property|accessdate=December 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127170315/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do|archivedate=January 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits to freedom of panorama in France have a drastic effect on Wikipedia articles about French architecture. Wikimedia Commons editors routinely delete any images of recent French architecture, despite the changes in the law, because Commons does not allow images where commercial use is prohibited.

===Australia===

In [[Australia]], freedom of panorama is dealt with in the federal [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]], sections 65 to 68. Section 65 provides: "The copyright in a work ... that is situated, otherwise than temporarily, in a public place, or in premises open to the public, is not infringed by the making of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of the work or by the inclusion of the work in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast". This applies to any "artistic work" as defined in paragraph (c) of section 10: a "work of artistic craftsmanship" (but not a circuit layout).&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca1968133|Copyright Act 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "[[street art]]" may be protected by copyright.&lt;ref name="G124v01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/AsiCommon/Controls/BSA/Downloader.aspx?iDocumentStorageKey=62a2e433-4cab-4d6f-8dd2-dc4af24277e7&amp;iFileTypeCode=PDF&amp;iFileName=Street%20Art%20&amp;%20Copyright | title=Street Art &amp; Copyright | publisher=[[Australian Copyright Council]] | work=Information Sheet G124v01 | date=September 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322193002/http://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/AsiCommon/Controls/BSA/Downloader.aspx?iDocumentStorageKey=62a2e433-4cab-4d6f-8dd2-dc4af24277e7&amp;iFileTypeCode=PDF&amp;iFileName=Street%20Art%20&amp;%20Copyright | archivedate=22 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street photographer's rights |url=http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/street-photographers-rights/ |website=Arts Law Information Sheet |publisher=Arts Law Centre of Australia |accessdate=8 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630101936/http://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/street-photographers-rights/ |archivedate=June 30, 2014 |deadurl=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographers &amp; Copyright |edition=17 |url=http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/732757805533a4bbed9e2a.pdf |publisher=Australian Copyright Council |accessdate=28 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702180313/http://www.copyright.org.au/admin/cms-acc1/_images/732757805533a4bbed9e2a.pdf |archivedate=July 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |page=7 |format=PDF |date=January 2014 |quote=You will generally need permission to photograph other public art, such as murals. }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Section 66 of the Act provides exceptions to copyright infringement for photos and depictions of buildings and models of buildings.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;

===Canada===
Section 32.2(1) of the Copyright Act (Canada) states the following:
{{quote|It is not an infringement of copyright
{{block indent|(b) for any person to reproduce, in a painting, drawing, engraving, photograph or cinematographic work
{{block indent|(i) an architectural work, provided the copy is not in the nature of an architectural drawing or plan, or}}
{{block indent|(ii) a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship or a cast or model of a sculpture or work of artistic craftsmanship, that is permanently situated in a public place or building;}}}}}}
The Copyright Act also provides specific protection for the incidental inclusion of another work seen in the background of a photo. Photos that "incidentally and not deliberately" include another work do not infringe copyright.

===United States===
{{further|Copyright in architecture in the United States}}
[[copyright law of the United States|United States copyright law]] contains the following provision:
{{quote|The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.|[[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 120|17 U.S.&amp;nbsp;Code §&amp;nbsp;120(a)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17 U.S. Code § 120 - Scope of exclusive rights in architectural works|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|access-date=4 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419101318/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120|archivedate=19 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Former USSR===
Almost all countries from the former [[Soviet Union]] lack freedom of panorama. Exceptions are three countries whose copyright laws were amended recently. The first was [[Republic of Moldova]] in July 2010, when the law in question was approximated to EU standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors = Eugene Stuart, Eduardo Fano, Linda Scales, Gerda Leonaviciene, Anna Lazareva | title = Intellectual Property Law and Policy.

==Two-dimensional works==
The precise extent of this permission to make pictures in public places without having to worry about copyrighted works being in the image differs amongst countries.&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; In most countries, it applies only to images of three-dimensional works&lt;ref name="uk_2"&gt;See ''e.g.'' Lydiate.&lt;/ref&gt; that are permanently installed in a public place, "permanent" typically meaning "for the natural lifetime of the work".&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;Rehbinder, M.: ''Schweizerisches Urheberrecht'' 3rd ed., p.&amp;nbsp;158, Stämpfli Verlag, Berne, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7272-0923-2}}.

==Public space==
Many laws have subtle differences in regard to public space and private property. Whereas the photographer's location is irrelevant in Austria,&lt;ref name="seiler"/&gt; in Germany the permission applies only if the image was taken from public ground, and without any further utilities such as ladders, lifting platforms, airplanes etc.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; Under certain circumstances, the scope of the permission is also extended to actually private grounds, e.g. to publicly accessible private parks and castles without entrance control, however with the restriction that the owner may then demand a fee for commercial use of the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |title=Decision of the German Federal Court in favour of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten, December 17, 2010 |publisher=Juris.bundesgerichtshof.de |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014190054/http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2010&amp;Sort=3&amp;nr=54399&amp;pos=0&amp;anz=241 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Eastern European countries the copyright laws limit this permission to non-commercial uses of the images only.&lt;ref name="elst"&gt;See e.g. for Russia: Elst, M.: ''Copyright, Freedom of Speech, and Cultural Policy in the Russian Federation'', p.&amp;nbsp;432f; Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden/Boston, 2005; {{ISBN|90-04-14087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also international differences in the particular definition of a "public place". In most countries, this includes only outdoor spaces (for instance, in Germany),&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; while some other countries also include indoor spaces such as public museums (this is for instance the case in the UK&lt;ref name="uk"/&gt; and in [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name="ru"&gt;Elst p. 432, footnote 268. Also see [http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607021156/http://www.consultant.ru/popular/gkrf4/ |date=2012-06-07 }} (in force as of January 1, 2008), clarifying this.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a controversy among Filipino photographers and establishment managements. On June 12, 2013, [[Philippine Independence Day]], pro-photography group, Bawal Mag-Shoot dito, launched at the Freedom to Shoot Day protest at [[Luneta Park]]. The group is protesting for their right to take photos on historical and public places, especially in Luneta and [[Intramuros]]. The park management imposes a fee for D-SLR photographers to shoot images for commercial purposes but it was also reported that security guards also charge 500 pesos to shoot photos even for non-commercial purposes, an act which the advocacy group branded as "extortion". The group also claimed that there is discrimination against Filipino photographers and claimed that the management is lenient on foreign photographers. There is no official policy on taking photographs of historical places and the group has called legislators to create a law on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nadezhda |last=Tanola |url=http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |title=Photographers to declare June 12 as ‘Freedom to Shoot Day’ - Remate &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202220640/http://www.remate.ph/2013/06/photographers-to-declare-june-12-as-freedom-to-shoot-day/#.UuMvkxAhLIU |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-terrorism laws==
Tension has arisen in countries where freedom to take pictures in public places conflicts with more recent [[anti-terrorism legislation]]. In the United Kingdom, the powers granted to police under section 44 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] have been used on numerous occasions{{fact|date=August 2016}} to stop amateur and professional photographers from taking photographs of public areas. Under such circumstances, police are required to have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is a terrorist.&lt;ref name="photo-homeoffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130125102358/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2009/012-2009/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=Photography and Counter-Terrorism legislation |date=18 August 2009|publisher=The Home Office|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Act does not prohibit photography, critics have alleged that these powers have been misused to prevent lawful public photography.&lt;ref name="bbc-terrorist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7351252.stm|title= Innocent photographer or terrorist?|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom |date=17 April 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable instances have included the investigation of a schoolboy,&lt;ref name="schoolboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|title=Terrorism Act: Photography fears spark police response|date=30 October 2008|publisher=Amateur Photographer Magazine|accessdate=2 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713150716/http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/terrorism-act-photography-fears-spark-police-response-25025|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Member of Parliament]]&lt;ref name="pelling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|title=Tory MP stopped and searched by police for taking photos of cycle path|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223201420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4144210/Tory-MP-stopped-and-searched-by-police-for-taking-photos-of-cycle-path.html|archivedate=23 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[BBC]] photographer.&lt;ref name="overs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset |last=Davenport |first=Justin |date=27 November 2009 |publisher=Evening Standard |accessdate=30 November 2009 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130161651/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23776068-bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset.do |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023085953/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/bbc-man-in-terror-quiz-for-photographing-st-pauls-sunset-6714008.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 October 2012|title=BBC man in terror quiz for photographing St Paul's sunset - News - London Evening Standard|date=23 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of these powers has since been reduced, and guidance around them issued to discourage their use in relation to photography, following litigation in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="sec44"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |title=Section 44 Terrorism Act |publisher=Liberty |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060834/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/justice-and-fair-trials/stop-and-search/section-44-terrorism-act |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexy-Legs-With-High-Heels.jpg|thumb|250px|High-heel shoes worn in an overt sexual context.]]
'''Fuck-me shoes''', alternatively '''fuck-me boots''', is a slang term for women's [[high-heeled shoes]] that exaggerate a sexual image. The term can be applied to any women's shoes that are worn with the intention of arousing others. It is sometimes used to imply condemnation against the women who choose to wear them or in a [[misogyny|misogynistic]] fashion toward the women who wear them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egan|first=Danielle|year=2012|title=Sexuality, youth and the perils of endangered innocence: how history can help us get past the panic|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2012.666232?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Gender and Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is similar in meaning to ''[[kinky boots]]'', although typically ''kinky boots'' refer more specifically to boots suited to a particular fetish.

== Term and usage ==
The phrase possibly originated in the United States, where two similar terms are used: {{" '}}fuck-you shoes' implying a disregard for convention or propriety, or 'fuck-off shoes' where 'fuck-off' means both outsize and aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=Tony|title=Dictionary of Contemporary Slang|year=2009|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0220-6|page=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight trousers were called "come fuck-me's" as listed in a 1972 British dictionary of slang, while a 1974 book is cited as making a reference to a person wearing "a pair of fabulous 1940s-[[Joan Crawford]]-fuck-me's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheidlower|first=Jesse|title=The F-Word|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539311-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "We are the Dead" from [[David Bowie]]'s 1974 ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' album mentions "fuck-me pumps."

Prominent feminist [[Germaine Greer]] brought what had been an "obscure" term to more mainstream notoriety when she used it in 1995. Greer used the term in referring to British journalist [[Suzanne Moore]]'s alleged "hair bird's-nested all over the place, fuck-me shoes and three fat inches of cleavage". Greer made the remark in response to a column Moore had written about Greer in ''[[The Guardian]]'', where Moore had mistakenly repeated an incorrect rumor that Greer had a hysterectomy as a voluntary decision to have herself sterilized.&lt;ref name="Greer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thackray|first=Rachelle|title=Germaine Greer smacks her sisters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 21, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719005038/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|archivedate=July 19, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greer was also quoted during the 1990s as criticizing a number of women writers that she termed "lifestyle feminists"&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt; who were, in her view, espousing feminism at nothing more than a superficial level. Moore's response was that her fashion choices were dictated by her own tastes and not to please men: "as someone who grew up with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], I take it for granted that women dress to please themselves and not men..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caudwell|first=Jayne|title=Sport, Sexualities And Queer/theory|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36761-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moore has said her footwear is "not worn just for the benefit of men", implying that the intention is twofold, to please both her and observers, although she also says "Most of the pleasure [of buying shoes] involves a private fantasy that begins with me and ends at my feet. Men don't get a look in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benstock, Sheri |author2=Ferriss, Suzanne |title=Footnotes: On Shoes|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2871-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident, and the term, received coverage in British media and beyond, and the term has become associated with Greer in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calcutt|first=Andrew|title=Brit Cult: An A to Z of British Pop Culture|year=2001|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-8092-9324-7|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer had been denouncing [[stiletto heel|stiletto shoes]] as symbols of women's subordination as early as 1971.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Tim|title=Fashion in Focus: Concepts, Practices and Politics|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44793-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues to use the phrase "fuck me shoes" in public speaking when discussing gender and clothing styles society deems appropriate.

The expression was further popularized when British jazz singer [[Amy Winehouse]] released the single "Pumps" (originally titled "[[Fuck Me Pumps]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on her 2003 album ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]''), a song about gold diggers.

In January 2011, in a forum with teenaged students in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], Greer noticed the popularity of silicone [[breast implants]] in the audience. She asked students why they thought women tennis players wore skirts, and asked why a young woman would choose to wear stiletto shoes: "So you think the shoes are her fetish?&amp;nbsp;... I call them fuck-me shoes", she said, "because you can't walk in them but you can wear them in bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Gaby|title=Hay Festival Cartagena: Passionate Germaine Greer's still a class act|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|newspaper=The Telegraph (UK)|date=January 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702232609/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|archivedate=July 2, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural debate ===

The underlying conflict arises from the question of what is considered an appropriate way for women to present their bodies in public spaces. Some feminists have come to view criticisms of fashion choices to be what they term "[[slut-shaming]]", an action they view as misogynist, even when coming from other women. The development of the [[SlutWalk]] protest demonstrations against [[dress codes]] is influenced by this position. 

When [[punk fashion]] was on the rise during the late 1970s, young women consciously played with the symbolism inherent in their accessorizing, mixing choices that created a jarring visual clash; leather was combined with lace, steel spikes with velvet, stiletto heels with heavy ankle chains. The result was to exaggerate a look of sexual aggression, turning {{" '}}fuck me' shoes into signifiers of 'fuck you{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"/&gt; The punk influenced youth counterculture continues with this trend, part of the wider trend of [[fetish fashion]].

[[File:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|350px|Gaius addressing the [[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]].]]
'''Gaius Sempronius Gracchus''' (154–121 BC) was a [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] ''[[Populares|Popularis]]'' politician in the 2nd century BC and brother of the reformer [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]]. His election to the office of [[tribune]] in the years 123 BC and 122 BC and reformative policies while in office prompted a constitutional crisis and his death at the hands of the [[Roman Senate]] in 121 BC.

== Background ==
{{Ancient Roman Comitium of the Republican era}}
Gaius Gracchus was born into a family who had a strong tradition in the politics of ancient Rome. His father, [[Tiberius Gracchus the Elder]], was a powerful man in Roman politics throughout the 2nd century BC and had built up a large and powerful clientele largely based in Spain. His mother was [[Cornelia Africana]], daughter of [[Scipio Africanus]], a noble woman who was a major influence on the Gracchi; as a widow, she refused the marriage proposal of [[Ptolemy VIII]], the King of Egypt, preferring to devote her life to the upbringing of her sons.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;Bradley P.,'' Ancient Rome: Using Evidence'', Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was attached to the [[Claudii]] faction in Roman politics despite his mother's background. It can be supposed, however, that both the Gracchi brothers would have come into contact with powerful members of both the Claudii and [[Scipio (cognomen)|Cornelii Scipiones]] factions.&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;
 
Gaius Gracchus was the younger brother of [[Tiberius Gracchus]], by about nine years.  He was heavily influenced both by the reformative policy of his older brother, and by his death at the hands of a senatorial mob. Plutarch suggests that it was "the grief he had suffered [that] encouraged him to speak out fearlessly, whenever he lamented the fate of his brother."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch,'' Makers of Rome'', Penguin Books, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly aspects of his reforms, and especially his judicial reforms, seem to have been directed at the people responsible for his brother's death.

== Early political career ==
[[File:The pursuit of Caius Gracchus.jpg|thumb|The pursuit of Gaius Gracchus]]
Gaius's political career began in 133 BC, when he served with Tiberius's land-commission. In 126 BC, he became a [[quaestor]] in the Roman province of [[Sardinia]], where his merits advanced his good reputation. During his quaestorship, he honed his skills in oratory.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 2"&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In one particularly harsh Sardinian winter, the [[Legatus|Legate]] of the local garrison requisitioned supplies from the nearby towns, despite their objections. When they appealed and won the Senate's approval to keep their supplies, Gaius made them a personal appeal for aid. Fearing this as a ploy for popular approval, the Senate rebuffed envoys sent by [[Micipsa]], king of [[Numidia]], who had sent grain to Gaius based on their mutual regard. The Senate ordered the garrison's replacement, but also ordered that Gaius remain in his post, in Sardinia.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 2"/&gt;

Gaius returned to Rome, to appeal the decision. He was accused of unlawfully abandoning his post, but won popular support when he pointed out that he had served twelve years - two more than the basic requirement - and had been quaestor for two years though legally only required to serve one. Furthermore, he had used the Roman money that he had brought with him to this quaestorship to aid Sardinia, and had never used his position to line his own pockets.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 2"/&gt;

He was then accused of aiding in an Italian revolt at [[Fregellae]], but little evidence supported this. His support for the reforms of [[Gaius Papirius Carbo (consul 120 BC)|Gaius Papirius Carbo]] and [[Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 125 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Flaccus]], his evident skills at oratory and his association with the reforms of his brother led the senatorial nobles to try him on charges plainly false or heavily exaggerated. He cleared himself with ease and in 122 was elected to serve as a [[tribune]] for the following year.&lt;ref name="a2" &gt;Cary M. and Scullard H., ''A History of Rome'', PANGRAVE, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius used his celebrated oratory, considered to be the best in Rome, to attack his opponents at every chance and frequently lamented the fate of his brother [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]]. He criticised the Senate's failure to emulate their ancestors' respect for the tribune, citing its decision to wage war on the [[Falerii]] for insulting the tribune Genucius, or how Gaius Veturius had been condemned to death for failing to make way for the tribune. He chastised the people for standing by while Tiberius and his supporters were beaten and cited the unlawful sentences of exile that followed, because the accused were not permitted to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribuneship of 123–122 BC==

===Reforms in 123/2 BC===
Gaius' social reforms were far wider reaching than the reforms of his brother Tiberius. Perhaps motivated by the fate of his brother, some of his earliest reforms dealt with the judiciary system. He set up two initial measures, the first of which prohibited a magistrate who had been deposed by the people from holding office a second time. Gaius's second bill established the right of the people to prosecute any magistrate who had exiled citizens without a trial.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions were a direct response to the Senate's actions in the aftermath of his brother Tiberius's murder.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

Courts with capital punishment, not set up by the people, were now declared illegal by a retrospective measure which saw the former consul Popilius Laenas driven into exile. Further reforms to the judicial system were passed to check the acquittals by senatorial juries of senators charged with extortion; the [[Lex Acilia Repetundarum|Lex Acilia]] placed extortion trials under the control of the [[Equestrian order|equites]] class, and trial procedures were redesigned in favour of the prosecution.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt; Aside from benefiting the provincials by dispensing of the conflict of interests involved in Senators trying their fellow-Senators on crimes of which they were often guilty themselves, it was also a significant step in wrenching apart the longstanding alliance of the rich,  Senators and Equites, in oppressing the poor proletariat, and bringing the Equites to his own side against the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', (Meridian Books, 1958), ch. II., pp. 68, 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Beesely, ''The Gracchi, Marius and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History'', (Kindle edition), ch. II., p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A second measure which Gracchus passed to please the Equites was in changing the arrangements of the Senate for collecting the taxes from the recently acquired (133) province of Asia. Whereas the Senate had arranged for a fixed sum to be paid directly to the state, excluding the capitalist Equites, Gracchus passed a measure changing the tax to a 10% tax on the lands of the province, the right of collecting which was auctioned off at Rome, thus naturally placing it in the hands of the Equites, since the Senators were banned from commerce, and the provincials were too distant.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, pp. 67, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been stated that Gracchus' rearrangement was mere base pandering to the avarice of the Equites, who used the opportunity to extort fearful sums from the Asian provincials, it is also true that, on the other hand in a year of drought for instance, the 10% tax of Gracchus would be actually far more favorable to the province than a fixed amount.&lt;ref&gt;Beesely, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Tiberius' land measures had already accomplished their object by 129, when the Senate effectively froze it (by transferring jurisdiction regarding the right to proclaim land “Public” or “Private” from the land commission to the consuls), Gracchus symbolically returned jurisdiction over the land to the commission, gratifying popular sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As a substitute to the allotments, large overseas colonies were planned to provide for thousands of settlers which may have included some Italians as well as Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lex Frumentaria'' required that the state buy bulk grain from North Africa and Sicily and distribute it to citizens at a low price, as a monthly ration. Secondary roads were extended throughout Italy, to facilitate trade and communication. Rome's censors auctioned off contracts for tax collection in Asia.

Gaius's ''Lex Militaris'' provided for the free issue of clothes and equipment to soldiers, shortened the term of military service and forbade the draft of boys under the age of seventeen. These reforms were intended to raise army morale and to win the political support of soldiers, allies, and voters with small incomes.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Allen, Heichelheim Fritz, and Yeo Cedric, ''A History of the Roman People'', Prentice Hall, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius submitted a franchise bill that sought the extension of Roman citizenship to all Latin citizens, and of Latin citizenship to all Italian allies. The bill was rejected because the Roman Patricians had no wish to share the benefits of citizenship, including subsidised grain and entertainment. The rejection of this measure led, in part, to the disastrous [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War of 90 BC]].&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

In a further slight to the power of the Senate, Gaius changed physically how speeches were delivered from the [[Rostra]]. Formerly, when a speaker delivered a speech in the Forum, he turned his face to the right in the direction of the [[Curia Hostilia|curia]], the Senate house, and the [[Comitium]]. Instead, Gaius would turn his face to the left, toward the direction of the Forum proper, effectively turning his back on the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fredrick2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Fredrick|title=The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmVd4I2qvhwC&amp;pg=PA198|date=3 October 2002|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6961-7|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius showed great efficiency in his administration. He oversaw the implementation of each new institution, and personally selected 300 equestrian jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He helped Gaius Fannius win the consulship for 122, and was elected as tribune the same year by popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senatorial Response===
The senate interpreted Gaius' popularity and legislation as threats to its privilege and position. It backed another tribune, [[Marcus Livius Drusus (consul)|Livius Drusus]]. He was placed under strict orders not to incite violence; instead, he should propose legislation that would please the common people, and make it known that he had the Senate's backing. In the event, his proposed legislation was neither credible nor beneficial to the commons, and was intended merely to undermine Gaius.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8-9"&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gaius proposed that two colonies be founded with reliable citizens, the Senate accused him of trying to win favor with the people before Drusus proposed twelve with three thousand citizens. When Gaius granted the most needy small plots of redistributed land on the condition they pay a small rent to the public coffers, the Senate accused him of trying to win favor with the people before Drusus proposed to do the same rent-free.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8-9"/&gt;

When Gaius proposed that all Latins should have equal voting rights, the Senate protested, but approved of Drusus' measure that no Latin would ever be beaten with rods. Drusus went to great pains to ensure he was never seen as the benefactor, politically or economically, of his legislation but rather that he proposed his measures, backed by the Senate, to further benefit the people. Drusus' constant referencing of the Senate worked and at least some of the people began to feel less hostility toward the Senate, marking the Senatorial plan a resounding success.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 8-9"/&gt; When a measure was passed to found a colony at [[Carthage]], which had been destroyed in 146 BC by [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio Africanus the Younger]], Gaius was appointed to oversee the construction and left for Africa. Drusus immediately took advantage of Gaius' absence by attacking Gaius' ally, Fulvius Flaccus, who was known by the Senate to be an agitator and was suspected by some of stirring up the Italian allies to revolt.

A new candidate emerged for the consulship, one [[Lucius Opimius]], who had opposed Fannius for the consulship in 122 BC and been stymied by Gaius' machinations. Opimius, a staunch conservative and oligarchical man who wanted to restore power to the Senate, had garnered a significant following and stood poised to challenge Gaius directly. Opimius had made it his sole mission to unseat Gaius.

===Death of Scipio Africanus the Younger===

When Scipio the Younger agreed to represent the Italian allies, who were protesting the injustices done to them which Tiberius Gracchus' land reform was supposed to remedy, he won the hostility of the people, who accused him of standing against Tiberius Gracchus and wishing to abolish the law and incite bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars 1.19&lt;/ref&gt;

When Scipio died suddenly and mysteriously one day, Gaius was one of many political enemies implicated in his death.  Carbo had just that day delivered a fiery speech against Scipio and he—like other Gracchan political allies such as Fulvius Flaccus—was widely known to be an outspoken enemy of Scipio's during this time as his Gracchan-backed proposal to formally allow tribunes multiple terms in office was ultimately defeated in large part due to Scipio's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Stockton 91-2&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, between the years of his return from Spain in 132 and his death in 129, Scipio "inexorably began to unite the ruling oligarchy against" Gaius.&lt;ref&gt;Stockton 85-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the Gracchi family were also accused; Scipio had been in a loveless marriage to [[Sempronia (sister of the Gracchi)|Sempronia]], sister of the Gracchi brothers and daughter of their mother Cornelia - Scipio referred to his wife as 'deformed' and 'barren'.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars 1.20&lt;/ref&gt; Both women were suspected of murdering Scipio because of his perceived attempt to undo the reforms of Tiberius.

==Return to Rome and outbreak of violence==
The combined political positions of his fellow tribunes [[Lucius Opimius]], Livius Drusus and Marcus Minucius Rufus, another political enemy of Gaius, meant the repeal of as many of Gaius' measures as possible.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt; Gaius now stood on increasingly shaky ground with the Senate, though his popularity with the people remained undeniable. Gaius' return to Rome from Carthage set in motion a series of events that would eventually cause him to suffer the same fate as his brother. Gaius' first action was to move from his home on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]], where the wealthiest of Romans and the political elite lived, to a neighborhood near the Forum, believing that in so doing he was keeping to his democratic principles and reaffirming his loyalty to the people rather than to the privileged elite.&lt;ref name="a3" &gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius then called together all of his supporters from Italy to put into motion his legislation. The Senate convinced Fannius, whose friendship with Gaius had run its course, to expel all those who were not Roman citizens by birth from the city. Gaius condemned the proposal, promising support for the Italians, but his image took a hit when he failed to uphold his promises and did not stop Fannius' [[lictor]]s from dragging away a friend. Whether he did this because he was afraid to test his power or because he refused to do anything which would have given the Senate pretext to initiate violence remains unknown.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

Gaius further distanced himself from his fellow tribunes when he insisted that the seats for a gladiatorial show be removed to allow the poor to watch. When they refused, he removed them secretly at night. Plutarch claims this cost him a third term as tribune, because, although he won the popular vote, the tribunes were so upset that they falsified the ballots.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt; Opimius and his supporters began to overturn Gaius' legislation with the hope of provoking him into violence, but Gaius remained resolute. Rumors suggested that his mother Cornelia hired foreign men disguised as harvesters to protect him.&lt;ref name="a4" &gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Quintus Antyllius===
On the day that Opimius planned to repeal Gaius' laws, an attendant of Opimius, Quintus Antyllius, carrying the entrails of a sacrifice, forced his way through a crowd. A resulting scuffle between the supporters of the two opposing groups on the [[Capitoline Hill]] led to his death. Plutarch maintains that Antyllius had rudely pushed his way through the crowd and gave an indecent gesture and was immediately beset upon by Gracchan supporters much to the disapproval of Gaius.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt;

Appian states that Gaius had arrived with an escort of body guards in a distressed state. When Antyllius saw Gaius, he laid a hand on him, begging him not to destroy the state. When Gaius cast his scorn on Antyllius, his supporters took it as a sign to act on his behalf and struck Antyllius down. Gaius and Fulvius failed to exonerate themselves of the deed and returned home under the protection of their supporters to await the day's outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars 1.25&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Antyllius allowed a triumphant Opimius a pretext for action. On the following morning, with much showboating, the body of Antyllius was presented to the Senate as indicative of the measures Gaius would take. The senate passed a [[senatus consultum ultimum]], granting Opimius the right to defend the state and rid it of tyrants. The Senate armed itself and commanded all the equestrians to arm themselves and two of their servants and assemble the next morning.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 14"&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulvius gathered his supporters and they passed the evening in a drunken and raucous manner. Gaius, much more somber, paused in front of the statue of his father on his way out of the Forum, and, weeping, went homeward. His plight and obvious distress caused such sympathy among the people, who blamed themselves for betraying their champion, that a large party gathered outside his home to ensure his protection. Unlike Fulvius, Gaius' men were quiet and reflective of future events.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 14"/&gt;

==Death of Gaius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gaius Gracchus Flees.jpg|300px|thumb|Gaius Gracchus flees a mob of senators and [[equites]] after failing to win reelection to the Roman [[Tribune|tribunate]] in 121 BC.]] --&gt;

The following morning, Fulvius' men armed themselves with spoils from Fulvius' Gallic campaign and marched loudly to the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]. Gaius refused to gird himself with anything save a small dagger and his toga. As he left his home, his wife Licinia, daughter of Crassus, begged him not to go meet the same men who had murdered and dishonored Tiberius Gracchus, knowing well enough that Gaius was to die that day. Gaius, without saying a word, gently pried himself from her arms and left her there, weeping, until her servants eventually came to pick her up and carried her to her brother Crassus.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At Gaius' suggestion, Fulvius sent his youngest son Quintus to the Forum to speak to the Senate as a herald carrying a staff, which was only used when heralds approached enemies in times of war. Tearful, he pleaded for terms which many there were willing to hear, but Opimius insisted on speaking directly to Fulvius and Gaius, demanding they surrender themselves for trial. These terms were not negotiable. When Quintus returned to Gaius and Fulvius, Gaius was willing to acquiesce but Fulvius was not and sent the boy back.&lt;ref name="a5" &gt;Appian, Civil Wars 1.26&lt;/ref&gt;

When the boy came back to the Senate and relayed what his father Fulvius stated, Opimius placed him under arrest and under guard and advanced on Fulvius' position with a contingent of archers from Crete. When they fired on Fulvius' men, wounding many, the crowd was thrown into chaos and fled. Fulvius hid in an abandoned bath or workshop with his eldest son and when discovered both were executed. Appian adds that when they initially hid, citizens were hesitant to give them away, but when the whole row was threatened to be burned down they were handed over to the mob.&lt;ref name="a5" &gt;Appian, Civil Wars 1.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius, taking no part in the fighting and despairing at the bloodshed, fled to the [[Temple of Diana (Rome)|Temple of Diana]] on the Aventine where he intended to commit suicide but was stopped by his friends Pomponius and Licinius. Gaius knelt and prayed to the goddess, asking that the people of Rome be forever enslaved by their masters since many had openly and quickly switched sides when an amnesty was declared by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaius fled the temple and tried to cross the Tiber on a wooden bridge while Pomponius and Licinius stayed back to cover his retreat, killing as many as they could until they were themselves felled. Accompanied by only his slave Philocrates, Gaius fled, urged by onlookers though no man offered assistance despite Gaius' repeated requests for aid. Arriving at a grove sacred to [[Furrina]], Philocrates first assisted Gaius in his suicide before taking his own life, though some rumors held that Philocrates was only killed after he refused to let go of his master's body.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Death of Gaius Gracchus.jpg|thumb|350px|The ''Death of Gaius Gracchus'', by [[François Topino-Lebrun]], 1792.]]

Gaius' head was cut off, as Opimius had announced that whoever brought back the head would be paid its weight in gold. When the head measured an astonishing seventeen and two-thirds pounds, it was discovered that Septimuleius, who brought the head, committed fraud by removing the brain and pouring in molten lead and therefore received no reward at all. The bodies of Gaius, Fulvius and the three thousand supporters who also died were thrown into the Tiber, their property confiscated and sold to the public treasury. Appian adds that their homes were looted by their opponents.&lt;ref name="a5" /&gt;

Their wives were forbidden to mourn the death of their husbands and Licinia, wife of Gaius, was stripped of her [[dowry]]. Fulvius' youngest son, who took no part in the fighting and merely acted as herald, was executed, though Appian holds that Opimius allowed him to choose his own manner of death. Most outrageous to the people was when Opimius celebrated his victory by building a temple to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concord]] in the Forum with the Senate's approval. The people felt that a victory bought with the massacre of so many citizens was exceptionally distasteful. According to Plutarch, one night an inscription was carved that read "This temple of Concord is the work of mad Discord."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch maintains that Opimius was the first Roman to appoint himself dictator, kill 3,000 Roman citizens without trial, including the proconsul Fulvius Flaccus and the tribune Gaius Gracchus, a man renowned for his reputation and virtue. Ironically, this same Opimius then later committed fraud and accepted bribes from the [[Numidia]]n king [[Jugurtha]] and, after being convicted, spent his days in disgrace. The people, realizing that their democratic cause was now dead, understood how deeply they missed the Gracchus brothers.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 18"&gt;Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Statues were erected in Rome, the locations where they fell were consecrated as holy ground and the season's first fruits were offered as sacrifice. Many worshiped them daily as if the Gracchi had been elevated to divine status. Cornelia honored the memory of her sons' murders by constructing elaborate tombs at the spot of their deaths.&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Gaius Gracch. 18"/&gt; Appian adds that within 15 years, all of the progress done under the Gracchi had been overturned and the poor were in a much worse position than ever before, many reduced to unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, Civil Wars, 1.27&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of Gaius' laws were repealed by his political opponents, the ''Lex Frumentaria'' remained. It set a precedent for the "Roman Bread Dole" which existed in one form or another until the fall of the Western Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Frumentariae_Leges.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gracchus Babeuf==

The French revolutionary [[François-Noël Babeuf]] took up the name "[[Gracchus Babeuf]]" in conscious emulation of the Roman brothers, and published a newspaper ''Le tribun du peuple'' ("the tribune of the people"). Ultimately he, like them, met a violent end.

'''Gender advertisement''' refers to the images in [[advertising]] that depict [[stereotypical]] [[gender roles]] and displays. Gender displays are used heavily in advertising in order to establish the role of one gender in relation with the other, and some scholars argue that advertisers are obsessed with gender.&lt;ref name="sut objectification"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=What's Wrong With a Little Objectification?|url=http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/whatswrongwithalit/|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers focus on gender relationships, because people define themselves by gender, and gender can be "communicated at a glance", making it easy for advertisers to use this theme in their work.&lt;ref name="sut objectification" /&gt; The effects of advertising on body image have been studied by researchers, ranging from psychologists to marketing professionals.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Mary C. and Gentry, James W. "Stuck in the Model Trap: The Effects of Beautiful Models on Female Pre-Adolescents and Adolescents." The Journal of Advertising (1997): 19-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Posavac" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bristol" /&gt; "These days we know that the media and body image are closely related. Particularly, the body image advertising portrays affects our own body image. Of course, there are many other things that influence our body image: parenting, education, intimate relationships, and so on. The popular media does have a big impact, though."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Media and Body Image|url = http://www.mirror-mirror.org/the-media-and-body-image.htm#sthash.bAakNi10.dpuf|website = www.mirror-mirror.org|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because thousands of advertisements contain messages about physical attractiveness and beauty, examples which include commercials for clothes, cosmetics, weight reduction, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w4rq5u2044175080/|title = Embarrassing age spots or just plain ugly?

== Creation and maintenance of gender normality ==

[[Advertising]] is a significant agent of socialization in modern industrialized societies, and is used as a tool to maintain certain social constructions, such as gender. Men and women are depicted as differing in attitudes, behavior, and social statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Belknap | first1 = Penny | last2 = Leonard II | first2 = Wilbert M. | title = A conceptual replication and extension of erving goffman's study of gender advertisements | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 103–118 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00289848 | date =August 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00289848 | accessdate = 4 December 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are what separate the sexes into different genders. Gender advertisements give the viewers a glimpse into a world laden with socially defined and constructed gender relations, displays, and roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attenborough | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick T.

Advertisements take something that exists already in the world and they change it, forming a distorted reflection. "They emphasize some things and de-emphasize others," it is a hyper ritualization of the world, and we recognize, and even relate with some of the images.&lt;ref name="sut objectification" /&gt;

== Role of gender in advertising ==
It is argued that these images could be teaching the viewers a vast array of social [[Sensory cue|cues]], and even the most subtle ones make an impact on the viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=Stanley J.|title=Mass communication theory: foundations, ferment, and future|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-50363-0|pages=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5TAebeoDnJ4C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=vulnerable+women+and+dominant+men+in+advertising#v=onepage&amp;q=vulnerable%20women%20and%20dominant%20men%20in%20advertising&amp;f=false|author2=Dennis K. Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further it is said that gender relations are learned through advertisements.&lt;ref name="sut objectification" /&gt; Among these learned gender roles are those of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]]. Men and women are portrayed in advertisements according to the constructed definition of femininity and masculinity. To be a woman is to be feminine and to be a man is to be masculine. There is little room for variation or a reversal of roles, except within the smaller frame of [[niche marketing]].&lt;ref name="MediaEd"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=The Codes of Gender|url=https://shop.mediaed.org/the-codes-of-gender-p177.aspx|publisher=Media Education Foundation|accessdate=14 October 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masculinity in advertising ===
In advertising, men are often portrayed in the following ways:&lt;ref name="MediaEd" /&gt;
* Alert and conscious of surroundings
* Standing upright
* Eyes open and looking around
* Bodies are controlled
* Mean expression on face
* Gripping things tightly with hands
* Hands in pockets
* Serious
* Physically active

{{quote|text=Bravery, adventurousness, being able to think rationally, being strong and effective, for example, are all "manly" traits that are usually encouraged.

=== Social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculinity and sexuality in advertising ===
Since the 1980s, men's bodies have been used more frequently in advertising, depicting a similarly idealized body image to that portrayed of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=R. |author2=C. Elliott|year=2005|title=Idealized images of the male body in advertising: a reader‐response exploration|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/criac/publications/pdf/15_Elliott.pdf|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=11|number=1|pp=3-19|doi=10.1080/1352726042000263566|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226081528/http://www.bath.ac.uk/criac/publications/pdf/15_Elliott.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Research by Martin and Gnoth  (2009) found that feminine men preferred feminine models in private, but stated a preference for the traditional masculine models when their collective self was salient. In other words, when concerned about being classified by other men as feminine, feminine men endorsed traditional masculine models. The authors suggested this result reflected the social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

Body Panic: Gender, Health, and The Selling of Fitness.New York University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that these ideals have influences on the expectancies of what a healthy body constitutes in young people and can contribute negative mental health issues in regard to body image.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other researchers, such as Heidi Posavac, acknowledge this, but believe that this only applies to teenagers who already possess low self-esteem or a poor self-images.&lt;ref name="Posavac"&gt;Posavac, Heidi D., Posavac, Steven S., and Posavac, Emil J. ''Exposure to Media Images of Female Attractiveness and Concern with Body Weight Among Young Women'' Sex Roles, Volume 38, 187-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a growing number of advertisements are showing men as [[sex object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kimmel, Allan J. and Elisabeth Tissier-Desbordes (1999)|title=Males, Masculinity, and Consumption: an Exploratory Investigation|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=11390}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on male body obsession found that advertisements for everything from cars to underwear depicted bodybuilder images with "washboard abdominal muscles, massive chests, and inflated shoulders, a mixture of muscularity and leanness probably attainable only by drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pope Jr|first=H. G.|author2=K. A. Phillips|author3=R. Olivardia |year=2000|title=The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, researchers, including Terry Bristol, have found teenagers to be generally unaffected by these advertisements due to the idea that repeat exposure can create an immunity to images and messages in advertisements.&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;Mangleburg, Tamara F. and Bristol, Terry. "Socialization and Adolescents' Skepticism Toward Advertising", ''The Journal of Advertising'' (1998): 11-21&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some researchers, such as Paul Humphreys, have concluded that exposure to such advertisements can actually create higher self-esteem in teenagers.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144504000518#sec2|title = Body Image : Impact of exposure to idealised male images on adolescent boys' body image|date = |accessdate = 2011-11-28|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.05.001|volume=1|journal=Body Image|pages=253–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;Myers, Philip N. Jr. and Biocca, Frank A. ''The Elastic Body Image: The Effects of Television Advertising and Programming on Body Image Distortions on Young Women'', Journal of Communications (1992): 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; Though women's equality is advancing in society, men have become more fixated with muscularity because it is still seen as a cultural symbol of masculinity. In addition, it has been suggested that a muscular body has become an aesthetic norm for [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]] as well as [[homosexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connel|first=R.W (1995)|title=Masculinities|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Masculinities.html?id=YuR2uFxxvPoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[content analysis]] study of exclusively male images in men's magazines, it was found that most of the bodies in advertising were not 'ordinary', but those of strong and hard 'male figures'. The study showed that males in the advertisements were usually [[Objectification|objectified]] and [[Depersonalization|depersonalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbe, R.H. and P.J. Albanese (1996)|title=Man to man: a content analysis of sole-male images in male audience magazines.|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4189016?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101246160203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation of [[Ectomorphic|ectomorphs]] (thin and lightly muscled) was limited predominantly to the advertising of clothing that may look more appealing on slimmer, taller men. [[wikt:endomorph|Endomorphs]] (soft and round) were rarely depicted and if they were, tended to be the object of humour. It is important to note that representations of male bodies are often used irrespective of their relevance to the product being promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson, M. and G. England (2000)|title=Body work: depicting the male body in men's lifestyle magazines, in: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Annual Conference, University of Derby, CD ROM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in ''JAMA Pediatrics'' in January shows concerns about physique and muscularity in particular, among young males are "relatively common". The researchers said approximately 18 percent of participants in their study (which included 5,527 males) were "extremely concerned for their weight and physique". Furthermore, the researchers found 7.6 percent of young males were "very concerned about muscularity" and were using techniques that could be harmful to obtain an ideal body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extreme body image in media impacts males too|url = http://national.deseretnews.com/article/1483/extreme-body-image-in-media-impacts-males-too.html|website = national.deseretnews.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Femininity in advertising ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guesswomandelicate.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Woman as delicate, not alert, and self-touching: Feminine]] --&gt;

Portrayals of women in advertising:&lt;ref name="MediaEd" /&gt;
* Touching self
* Caressing an object
* Lying on the floor
* Sitting on a bed or chair
* Eyes closed
* Not alert
* Confused
* Vulnerable
* Body contorted
* Dressed like a child
* Holding an object or a man for support
* Sexy and sexually available
* Seductive
* Playful
* Careless

These are positions of [[submissiveness]] and powerlessness. This can be clearly seen when women are shown lying on the floor as men are standing over them, literally depicting women as being beneath men.  Women are urged to pursue beauty and sex appeal, and part of the sex appeal is [[submission]].&lt;ref name="CML"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/how-do-media-images-men-affect-our-lives|title=How do Media Images of Men Affect Our Lives?|last=Femiano|first=Sam|author2=Mark Nickerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are campaigns such as the Girl Effect Campaign that have worked to change the way in which women are perceived for the better. These campaigns aim to reclaim the saying "like a girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calkin|first=Sydney|title=Globalizing ‘Girl Power’: Corporate Social Responsibility and Transnational Business Initiatives for Gender Equality.|journal=Globalizations|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discursive [[Social construction|constructions]] of these female bodies are quite plainly 'prepared for [[Consumerism|consumption]]' by men. These constructions not only reveal the inevitable gender-power relations about the body but also suggest the cultural ambivalence about sexualized bodily display and image management. This sort of ambivalence both idealizes and denigrates individuals' explicitly performed efforts to produce and portray bodies that conform to societal 'ideals.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malson, H. and C.

== History ==
{{quote|text=Toys for girls from the 1920s to the 1960s focused heavily on domesticity and nurturing. For example, a 1925 Sears ad for a toy broom-and-mop set proclaimed: "Mothers! Here is a real practical toy for little girls. Every little girl likes to play house, to sweep, and to do mother's work for her." Such toys were clearly designed to prepare young girls to a life of homemaking, and domestic tasks were portrayed as innately enjoyable for women. While girls' toys focused on domesticity, toys for boys from the '20s through the '60s emphasized preparation for working in the industrial economy. For example, a 1925 Sears ad for an Erector Set stated: "Every boy likes to tinker around and try to build things. With an Erector Set he can satisfy this inclination and gain mental development without apparent effort. ... He will learn the fundamentals of engineering." However, late-century marketing relied less on explicit sexism and more on implicit gender cues, such as color, and new fantasy-based gender roles like the beautiful princess or the muscle-bound action hero. These roles were still built upon regressive gender stereotypes – they portrayed a powerful, skill-oriented masculinity and a passive, relational femininity – that were obscured with bright new packaging. In essence, the "little homemaker" of the 1950s had become the "little princess" we see today.|sign=Elizabeth Sweet|source=[[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/toys-are-more-divided-by-gender-now-than-they-were-50-years-ago/383556| Toys are more divided by gender now than they were 50 years ago]]}}

== Gender displays in advertising ==
In the book ''gender advertising'' by [[Erving Goffman]] it states: "If gender is defined as the [[culturally]] established correlates of sex (whether in consequence of biology or learning) then gender display refers to [[Convention (norm)|conventionalized]] portrayals of those correlates."&lt;ref name="Erving Gender" /&gt; Gender displays can otherwise be defined as [[rituals]] of gender behavior, and they are used to help interpret social reality.&lt;ref name="sut objectification" /&gt; This is what advertising mainly borrows from, and for Goffman this is the reason as to why ads do not look strange to the public.&lt;ref name="sut objectification" /&gt; Further, Goffman argues that there are codes which can be used to identify gender. These codes of gender can be seen in the portrayals of men and women in advertising. There are four categories under which we can see these codes of gender: the family, the feminine touch, the ritualization of [[Hierarchy|subordination]], and licensed withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Erving Gender" /&gt;

== Role reversal ==
Sometimes the traditional gender roles are reversed. When this happens, one can see men behaving in ways that are generally associated with femininity, and women behaving in typically masculine ways. This is often the case in gay&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genderads.com/page7/gays/gays.html&lt;/ref&gt; and lesbian&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genderads.com/page7/lesbians/lesbians.html&lt;/ref&gt; advertising. Witnessing these ads can be a shock to most, as they are not accustomed to this reversal of roles. This is an indicator that there is in fact a distinction between the genders in advertising.&lt;ref name="MediaEd" /&gt;

== Effects of advertisements ==
Beauty can be defined largely as a perception. It is a group of social norms that interpret a particular form of appearance that is valued. Since almost four decades ago, women have been expected to conform to a particular body image and to behave in a certain manner of which would ultimately decipher and enforce their femininity (Bordo, 1997, p. 94).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bordo, Susan|title=Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.|location=Berkeley|publisher=U of California P|year=1997|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women strive to achieve this beauty which influences them to shape themselves and alter their appearance in order to conform to those norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cregan|first=Kate|title=Key Concepts in Body and Society|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These norms are largely derived from the media's presentation of models and well known stars through advertisements for products and magazine covers. As our society is now filled with these advertisements in all aspects of life, such as on TV, billboards, in supermarkets displayed with the products (particularly beauty products) and on social media, children are now viewing this material at a younger age and in turn creating the perception that this is the ideal appearance whilst they are still very impressionable. Young children learn by observing and imitating what is presented to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bakir, A.|author2=Palan, K.|year=2010|title=How are Children's Attitudes Toward Ads and Brands Affected by Gender-Related Content in Advertising?|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367390103|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=39|issue=1|pp=35-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early twentieth century, society began to pursue material goods with the goal of fulfilling a general desire to own the item rather than for later use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howson|first=Alexandra|title=The body in consumer culture|date=2004|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to the use of advertising media and the perception, particularly with beauty products, that the models pictured obtain their looks buy using these products.

It is very common for young men and women to compare themselves to models in ads, in terms of their physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Mary|author2=James Gentry|title=Stuck in the Model Trap: The Effects of Beautiful Models in Ads on Female Pre-Adolescents and Adolescents|journal=Journal of advertising|date=1997|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance and body size of the models within the advertisements in the final image seen by consumers are, more often than not, altered through editing programs such as Photoshop, in order to achieve the perfect (or impossible) desired look.  The use of these images creates a false beauty ideal for both men and women to aspire to, as well as creating the use of extreme dieting and surgical procedures in order to resemble a similar image that is displayed in advertising. This emphasis on an ideal body appearance has been regarded as being psychologically detrimental to the well-being of many young men and women, and on their self-image. The extant research shows that stereotypes can be helpful or detrimental, depending on several factors, such as the gender attitudes of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.857621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazine advertisements highlighting a thin, attractive female model yield greater self-objectification and the process of inspecting this type of advertisement can encourage women to think about their physical appearance as if looking on as a critical observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harper |last2= Tiggemann|first1=Brit |first2= Marika|title=The Effect of Thin Ideal Media Images on Women's Self-Objectification, Mood, and Body Image|journal=Sex Roles|date=2008|pages=649–657|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9379-x|volume=58|issue= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the media are frequently exposed to Western women, and the usage of skinny idealized women in advertising is prevalent. Data also shows that males who were exposed to advertisements of women being sexually objectified were more likely to believe stereotypes about sex roles as well as rape myth beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lanis|first=Kyra|last2=Covell|first2=Katherine|date=May 1995|title=Images of women in advertisements: Effects on attitudes related to sexual aggression|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01544216?LI=true|journal=Springer|volume=32|pages=639 - 649|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sexuality is used in advertising, certain values and attitudes towards sex are 'sold' along with a product. The message may be that "innocence is sexy", that women enjoy being dominated, that the use of a certain product is naughty but legal, or that use of a certain product will make the user more attractive to the opposite sex, and many other messages. The way beauty is portrayed in the media causes dissatisfaction and negative thoughts about oneself when those results are not achieved. Sociocultural standards of male images are presented in almost all forms of popular media, barraging men with images that portray what is considered to be the "ideal body". Such standards of beauty are almost completely unattainable for most men; a majority of the models displayed on television and in advertisements are well below what is considered healthy body weight. Mass media's use of such unrealistic models sends an implicit message that in order for a man to be considered beautiful, he must be unhealthy. The mindset that a person can never be "too rich or too thin" is all too prevalent in society, and it makes it difficult for males to achieve any level of contentment with their physical appearance. There has been a plethora of research to indicate that men are negatively affected by constant exposure to models that fulfill the unrealistic media ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|url = http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|website = www.westminstercollege.edu|access-date = 2016-02-08|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate = 2016-04-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, from the minute boys enter the classroom, masculine identity building is taking place in one form or another. At some level, teachers and students, both male and female, often act in accordance with a set of unspoken tenets that are subtly or explicitly reinforced through tacit approval, willing indifference, or a lack of awareness. William Pollack (as cited in Neu &amp; Weinfeld, 2007) calls this set of culturally embedded expectations about masculinity the Boy Code. An examination of this "code" yields new insights about the troublesome behaviors exhibited by many struggling boys in classrooms and reveals why boys with certain styles (SF/Interpersonal and NF/Self-Expressive, specifically) might experience its negative impact more deeply than their peers.&lt;ref name="Cleveland"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Boys who Struggle in School: Strategies that Turn Underachievers Into Successful Learners|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pKwCgFxMoRwC|publisher = ASCD|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 978-1-4166-1150-9|language = en|first = Kathleen Palmer|last = Cleveland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Helping Boys Succeed in School'', educators Terry Neu and Rich Weinfeld (2007) capture Pollack's Boy Code in the form of a "dos and don'ts" poster.

# Do not cry (no sissy stuff).
# Do not cower, tremble, or shrink from danger.
# Do not ask for help when you are unsure of yourself (observe the code of silence).
# Do not reach for comfort or reassurance.
# Do not sing or cry for joy.
# Do not hug your dearest friends.
# Do not use words to show tenderness and love.

The research of Neu and Weinfeld shows that the process of developing ideal male images is taking place in classrooms.

Much of the existing literature{{Who|date=June 2018}} on ideal male images has either focused narrowly on the impacts of media on adolescents' views towards ideal male images or parental style on the impacts on this topic. As a result, it often lacks the information necessary to systematically compare different groups' cultural backgrounds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Body image in advertising ==

The impact of media on body image has been closely studied in the past years, today, the prevalence of sexual content in media has become increasingly high. {{As of|2005}}, the average teenager in the U.S. consumes 3–4 hours of television a day, 30% of that being advertisements, and many adolescents are consuming 100 or more advertisements a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaed.org/handouts/AdvertisingExposure.pdf)|title=Media Education Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of social media, online advertisements have also become increasingly abundant. Many advertisements depict people with idealized bodies, many of which are photoshopped.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The average female model in the U.S. is a size 0 or 00 and is between the age of 14 and 19 years of age while the average woman living in the U.S. wears sizes 12–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/n_bodyimage.html|title=Texas University Health Services|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models shown in many advertisements have bodies that are genetically unattainable.

Studies have shown that consuming advertisements that contain ideal body image leads to an increase in body dissatisfaction, especially in young girls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pellitier|first=Luc G|year=2007|title=AN EXAMINATION OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC MOTIVATIONAL MECHANISMS FOR THE RELATIONS BETWEEN BODY DISSATISFACTION AND EATING BEHAVIORS|url=|journal=Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of gender, self-objectification when viewing ideal body images in media may lead to negative feelings towards one's body. A 2015 research study revealed that these negative feelings may occur after observing an advertisement for only 3 minutes, specifically advertisements regarding the sexualization of both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.08.001|pmid=26363356|title=The effects of advertisements that sexually objectify women on state body dissatisfaction and judgments of women: The moderating roles of gender and internalization|journal=Body Image|volume=15|pages=109–19|year=2015|last1=Krawczyk|first1=Ross|last2=Thompson|first2=J. Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thinking of one's body from an outside viewer's perspective may also lead to body shame, appearance anxiety, and in some cases contributes to certain eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the context of women advertisement, the image demonstrates an individual need that can be fulfilled through the women's participation in commodity culture (Nelson, 2013).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It must be noted that body-image meaning-transfer can be a lifelong process underlying the perpetual changes in the sociocultural environment, its cultural meaning, body-image trends, and pervasive media beauty ideologies (Yu et al. 2011).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Gender stereotypes and roles ==
People organize their knowledge about the world around them by sorting and simplifying received information. Therefore, they create cognitive schemes, which are certain representations of the reality displaying its most typical and fundamental elements and properties. These schemes are responsible for defining the essence of our worldview and have a significant influence on social cognition – understanding, anticipation, situation and emotion control.

Gender roles have also been impacted by the media and advertising. [[SlutWalk]] is one phenomenon that emerges through incontemporary "third-wave feminism". The SlutWalk movement helps increase victim visibility and reintroduce sexual violence issues to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Sorce, G. (2016). SlutWalk: Feminism, Activism and Media. International Journal of Communication (19328036), 1060–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles within media and advertising have also been impacted by sex and relationship commitments. Men have positive attitudes toward casual and recreational sex, whereas women value the emotional intimacy and commitment around a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;DAHL, D. W., SENGUPTA, J., &amp; VOHS, K. D. (2009). Sex in Advertising: Gender Differences and the Role of Relationship Commitment. Journal of Consumer Research, 36(2), 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in differentiating gender roles in the modern societies can be a perfect example of the negative social effects of using stereotypes. A division of gender roles is deeply rooted in today's society. Through the ages men have been considered to be financial providers, career-focused, assertive and independent, whereas women have been shown as low-position workers, loving wives and mothers, responsible for raising children and doing housework. Nowadays a family model is based rather on a partnership than on patriarchy and women have more rights and possibilities on the labor market. Feminist environment had a significant impact on the change in this situation. [[Women's liberation movement]] fought for the rights of women and for redefining traditional gender roles. Although females and males are still not equal, the differences between gender are not so vast anymore. Nevertheless, many social institutions, such as mass media, still use gender stereotypes, based on the assumption that they are well known to everyone and help the receivers to understand the content of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krytyka.org/gender-stereotypes-in-mass-media-case-study-analysis-of-the-gender-stereotyping-phenomenon-in-tv-commercials/|title=Gender stereotypes in mass media.

Gender roles in media and advertising is impacted by humor. Advertising frequently uses gender roles to promote products. There are various stereotypes in regards to humorous advertising with both males and females. Stereotypes can product oversimplified conceptions and misapplied knowledge evaluations. Humor is generated on two steps. First, some kind of incongruity that violates a predominating view has to be recognized and, second, if people cognitively resolve this incongruity, they experience humor. Humor occurs when it seems that things are normal, while at the same time something goes wrong that breaks our expectations. Men could be depicted in domestic roles doing chores, whereas women would be presented in independent roles. This would break our expectation and society norms that revolve around the gender roles. Exaggerating these gender norms would have a potential to be humorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eisend | first1 = M. | last2 = Plagemann | first2 = J. | last3 = Sollwedel | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 256–273 | doi = 10.1080/00913367.2013.857621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising strategy ==
Media and advertising has also taken a strategic role in today's society. Women's behavioral intention is enhanced more through a transformation message strategy than an information message strategy. However, a man's behavioral intention is an information message strategy as opposed to a behavioral intention.&lt;ref name="Yoon-Joo, L. 2010"&gt;Yoon-Joo, L., Haley, E., &amp; Avery, E. J. (2010). The Role of Gender and Message Strategy in the Perception of Advocacy Advertising. Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising (CTC Press), 32(1), 47-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements rarely portray people that look like "us", or the norm. Women are frail, thin, and often are edited or "touched up" to look thinner and flawless. The people at whom advertisements are aimed rarely look the same as those portrayed in the advertisements themselves.&lt;ref name="The Media and Body Image"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror-mirror.org/the-media-and-body-image.htm|title=The Media and Body Image|website=www.mirror-mirror.org|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Females process self-efficacy and behavioral intention emotionally rather than rationally like males do. Another gender difference that has emerged is consumer effectiveness and message strategy significantly predicted self-efficacy. These findings show a gender role within media and advertising.&lt;ref name="Yoon-Joo, L. 2010" /&gt;

Research suggests that there are four different and independent components. They are trait descriptors (self-assertion, concern for others), physical characteristics (hair length, body height), role behaviors (leader, taking care of children), and occupational status (truck driver, elementary school teacher, housewife). Each component has a masculine and a feminine version. Stereotyping becomes problematic when stereotypes lead to expectations and judgements that restrict life opportunities for subject of a social category. This is the reason why public policy is concerned about marketing activities that promote stereotypes. Each gender stereotype component can lead to negative consequences that restrict life opportunities, particularly for women. Physical characteristics can lead to reduced self-dignity, role behaviors may lead to restricted opportunities of self-development, and stereotyping of occupational roles may lead to disadvantages in women's careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gender roles in advertising|date=2011|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|volume=30|issue=5|pages=867–888|doi=10.2501/IJA-30-5-867-888|author= Knoll, S.|author2=Eisend, M.|author3=Steinhagen, J.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T.

==Rome==

The first ever Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the ''[[Vigiles]]'' in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.

Rome suffered a number of serious fires, most notably the fire on [[Great_Fire_of_Rome|19 July AD 64]] which eventually destroyed two thirds of Rome.

In [[Europe]], firefighting was quite rudimentary until the 17th century. In 1254, a royal decree of King [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] of France created the so-called ''guet bourgeois'' ("burgess watch"), allowing the residents of Paris to establish their own night watches, separate from the king's night watches, to prevent and stop crimes and fires. After the [[Hundred Years' War]], the population of Paris expanded again, and the city, much larger than any other city in Europe at the time, was the scene of several great fires in the 16th century. As a consequence, King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] disbanded the residents' night watches and left the king's watches as the only one responsible for checking crimes and fires.

[[London]] suffered [[Early fires of London|great fires]] in 798, 982, 989, 1212 and above all in 1666 (the [[Great Fire of London]]). The Great Fire of 1666 started in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane, consumed about two square miles (5&amp;nbsp;km²) of the city, leaving tens of thousands homeless. Prior to this fire, London had no organized fire protection system. Afterwards, insurance companies formed private fire brigades to protect their clients’ property. Insurance brigades would only fight fires at buildings the company insured. These buildings were identified by [[fire insurance marks]]. 
The key breakthrough in firefighting arrived in the 17th century with the first fire engines. Manual pumps, rediscovered in Europe after 1500 (allegedly used in [[Augsburg]] in 1518 and in Nuremberg in 1657), were only [[force pump]]s and had a very short range due to the lack of hoses. [[Germany|German]] inventor [[Hans Hautsch]] improved the [[manual pump]] by creating the first [[suction and force pump]] and adding some flexible hoses to the pump. In 1672, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist and inventor [[Jan Van der Heyden]]'s workshop developed the [[fire hose]]. Constructed of flexible [[leather]] and coupled every 50 feet (15 m) with [[brass]] fittings. The length remains the standard to this day in mainland Europe whilst in the UK the standard length is either 23m or 25m. 
The [[fire apparatus|fire engine]] was further developed by the Dutch inventor, merchant and manufacturer, [[John Lofting]] (1659–1742) who had worked with Jan Van der Heyden in Amsterdam. Lofting moved to London in or about 1688, became an English citizen and patented (patent number 263/1690) the "Sucking Worm Engine" in 1690. There was a glowing description of the firefighting ability of his device in The London Gazette of 17 March 1691, after the issue of the patent. 
The British Museum has a print showing Lofting's fire engine at work in London, the engine being pumped by a team of men. In the print three fire plaques of early insurance companies are shown, no doubt indicating that Lofting collaborated with them in firefighting. A later version of what is believed to be one of his fire engines has been lovingly restored by a retired firefighter, and is on show in Marlow Buckinghamshire where John Lofting moved in 1700. Patents only lasted for fourteen years and so the field was open for his competitors after 1704. 
 
[[Richard Newsham]] of Bray in Berkshire (just 8 miles from Lofting) produced and patented an improved engine in 1721 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon dominated the fire engine market in England. Pulled as a cart to the fire, these manual pumps were manned by teams of 4 to 12 men and could deliver up to 160 gallons per minute (12 L/s) at up to 120 feet (36 m). Newsham himself died in 1743 but his company continued making fire engines under other managers and names into the 1770s. The next major development in fire engine design in England was made by Hadley, Simpkin &amp; Lott co. in 1792 with a larger and much improved style of hand pumped engine which could be pulled to a fire by horses.

The city burghers later appointed eight prominent citizens to the "Rattle Watch" - these men volunteered to patrol the streets at night carrying large wooden rattles.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; If a fire was seen, the men spun the rattles, then directed the responding citizens to form bucket brigades. On January 27, 1678 the first fire engine company went into service with its captain (foreman) Thomas Atkins.&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt; In 1736 [[Benjamin Franklin]] established the [[Union Fire Company]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="FIR"/&gt;

The United States did not have government-run fire departments until around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to this time, private fire brigades  competed with one another to be the first to respond to a fire because [[insurance company|insurance companies]] paid brigades to save buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013408/http://www.afirepro.com/history.html|title=A Fire Pro - History of Fire Fighting|website=www.afirepro.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwriters also employed their own [[Salvage Corps]] in some cities.  The first known female firefighter [[Molly Williams]] took her place with the men on the dragropes during the blizzard of 1818 and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.

On April 1 of 1853, Cincinnati, Ohio featured the first professional fire department made up of 100% full-time employees.

In 2015, 70 percent of firefighters in the United States were volunteer. Only 4% of calls were actual fires. 64% were medical aid. 8% were false alarms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org//~/media/files/news-and-research/fire-statistics/fact-sheets/usfireservicefactsheet.pdf The United States Fire Service Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
The first fire brigades in the modern sense were created in [[France]] in the early 18th century. In 1699, a man with bold commercial ideas, [[François du Mouriez du Périer]] (grandfather of [[French Revolution]] general [[Charles François Dumouriez]]), solicited an audience with King [[Louis XIV]]. Greatly interested in Jan Van der Heyden's invention, he successfully demonstrated the new pumps and managed to convince the king to grant him the monopoly of making and selling "fire-preventing portable pumps" throughout the kingdom of France. François du Mouriez du Périer offered 12 pumps to the City of Paris, and the first Paris Fire Brigade, known as the ''Compagnie des gardes-pompes'' (literally the "[[Company (military unit)|Company]] of Pump Guards"), was created in 1716. François du Mouriez du Périer was appointed ''directeur des pompes de la Ville de Paris'' ("director of the City of Paris's pumps"), i.e. chief of the Paris Fire Brigade, and the position stayed in his family until 1760. In the following years, other fire brigades were created in the large French cities. Around that time appeared the current French word ''pompier'' ("firefighter"), whose literal meaning is "pumper." On March 11, 1733 the French government decided that the interventions of the fire brigades would be free of charge. This was decided because people always waited until the last moment to call the fire brigades to avoid paying the fee, and it was often too late to stop fires. From 1750 on, the French fire brigades became para-military units and received uniforms. In 1756 the use of a protective helmet for firefighters was recommended by King [[Louis XV]], but it took many more years before the measure was actually enforced on the ground.

In [[North America]], [[Jamestown, Virginia]] was virtually destroyed in a fire in January, 1608. There were no full-time paid firefighters in America until 1850. Even after the formation of paid fire companies in the United States, there were disagreements and often fights over territory. [[New York City]] companies were famous for sending runners out to fires with a large barrel to cover the hydrant closest to the fire in advance of the engines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.windsorfire.com/a-brief-history-of-firefighting/|title=A Brief History of Firefighting - WindsorFire.com|date=2006-01-22|work=WindsorFire.com|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often fights would break out between the runners and even the responding fire companies for the right to fight the fire and receive the insurance money that would be paid to the company that fought it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 19th century and early 20th century volunteer fire companies served not only as fire protection but as political machines. The most famous volunteer firefighter politician is [[Boss Tweed]], head of the notorious [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, who got his start in politics as a member of the Americus Engine Company Number 6 ("The Big Six") in New York City.

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], drawing from the century-old experience of the ''gardes-pompes'', is generally attributed as creating the first "professional" firefighters, known as [[Sapeurs-Pompiers]] ("[[Sapper]]s-Firefighters"), from the [[French Army]]. Created under the Commandant of Engineers in 1810, the company was organized after a fire at the ballroom in the Austrian Embassy in Paris which injured several dignitaries.

In the UK, the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 set in motion changes which laid the foundations for organised firefighting in the future. In the wake of the Great Fire, the City Council established the first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office", in 1667, which employed small teams of Thames [[watermen]] as firefighters and provided them with uniforms and arm badges showing the company to which they belonged.

However, the first organised municipal fire brigade in the world was established in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], when the Edinburgh Fire Engine Establishment was formed in 1824, led by [[James Braidwood (firefighter)|James Braidwood]]. London followed in 1832 with the [[London Fire Brigade|London Fire Engine Establishment]].

On April 1, 1853, the [[Cincinnati Fire Department]] became the first full-time paid professional fire department in the United States, and the first in the world to use steam fire engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/fire/about-fire/history/|title=History - Fire|website=City of Cincinnati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first horse-drawn steam engine for fighting fires was invented in 1829, but not accepted in structural firefighting until 1860, and ignored for another two years afterwards. Internal combustion engine fire engines arrived in 1907, built in the United States, leading to the decline and disappearance of steam engines by 1925.

'''Joseph Rowntree''' (24 May 1836 – 24 February 1925) was an English [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] philanthropist and businessman from [[York]]. Rowntree is perhaps best known for being a champion of social reform, partner and friend of [[Charles_Booth_(philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], and his time as a [[chocolatier]] at family business ''[[Rowntree's]]'', one of the most important in Britain. Even as a powerful businessman, he was deeply interested in improving the [[quality of life]] of his employees; this led to him becoming a philanthropist, pursuing many [[charitable organization|charitable causes]]. In 1904 he created [[Rowntree trusts|three trusts]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|Joseph Rowntree Village Trust]] (JRVT) which was originally set up to build and manage the garden village of [[New Earswick]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust]] (JRCT) and the Joseph Rowntree Social Services Trust (JRSST). The latter two were both set up to effect social reform, the difference between them being that whereas the Charitable Trust was set up as a charity, the Social Services Trust was set up as a limited company so that if necessary it would be able to undertake social and political work not legally allowed by a charitable Trust. He suggested that only the JRVT would be permanent but in fact all the trusts are still in existence although the Social Services Trust has changed its name to the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and with the separation of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust from the Village Trust in 1968, there are now four trusts that exist today.

==Early life==
Rowntree was born the son of Sarah and [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|Joseph Rowntree]], on Pavement Street in York where his father owned a grocer's shop.&lt;ref name="Vernon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vernon|title=Quaker Business Man: The Life of Joseph Rowntree|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-38160-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Bootham School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/view/article/35857 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At fourteen he accompanied his father on a visit to Ireland, and witnessed the effects of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html Joseph Rowntree Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829193103/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html |date=29 August 2008 }} – ''[[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|The Joseph Rowntree Foundation]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This experience was to provide the grounding for his political views and business ideas later in life.

== Career ==
He started working in his [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|father's]] grocery business as an apprentice the following year, and after his father's death in 1859 he took over the running, jointly managing the business with his brother [[John Stephenson Rowntree]].
[[File:Joseph Rowntree house in York.jpg|thumb|The house where Rowntree lived, on Bootham in York.]]
In 1869 he joined his brother, [[Henry Isaac Rowntree]], who owned a chocolate factory in York.   When Henry Isaac died in 1883, Joseph became the owner of the company.  Joseph pursued his progressive ideas within the running of [[Rowntree's]], in the design of the new factory opened in 1881, and in the business practices followed therein, including the founding of one of the first [[Retirement plan|Occupational Pension Schemes]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog /&gt;

The company, [[Rowntree's]], grew from 30 to over 4,000 employees by the end of the 19th century making it Britain's eightieth largest manufacturing employer.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB /&gt; It merged with John Mackintosh and Co. in 1969 and was taken over by [[Nestlé]] in 1988.

He had two marriages, to Julia Eliza Seebohm in 1862 who died in 1863, and then to her cousin Emma Antoinette Seebohm in 1867 with whom he had six children.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35857 Joseph Rowntree Biography] – ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; The social investigator [[Seebohm Rowntree]] was one of their children.

Joseph Rowntree's grave, along with many other members of his family, can be seen in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] cemetery within the grounds of [[The Retreat]] on Heslington Road, [[York]].

Philosophical and political views: Joseph Rowntree was a supporter of liberal values, and was anxious to improve the quality of life of his employees. He provided them with a library, free education, a works magazine, a social welfare officer, a doctor, a dentist and a pension fund.

==The Joseph Rowntree School==
The [[Joseph Rowntree School]] was built in York in 1942 by the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust. In 2010 the school relocated to new premises costing £29 million. Students refer to it as "Jo Ro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex Joseph Rowntree School pupils invited to step back into the classroom|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/4862833.Ex_Joseph_Rowntree_School_pupils_invited_to_step_back_into_the_classroom/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=York Press|date=21 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Joseph Rowntree statue campaign==
A campaign was started in summer 2012 to put a statue of Joseph Rowntree at a prominent site in the centre of York, with a [[Facebook]] page – "A Joseph Rowntree statue for York City Centre" – that stated: "York should be proud of its greatest son! This campaign aims to place a statue of Joseph Rowntree, philanthropist, social reformer, and chocolatier, in Parliament Square, York, on the site of the repulsed and now-demolished toilet block."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Liptrot, [http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9884273.Campaign_for_statue_of_Joseph_Rowntree/ "Campaign for statue of Joseph Rowntree on former “splash palace” site in York"], ''The Press'', 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media system dependency theory''' ('''MSD'''), or simply '''media dependency''', was developed by Sandra Ball-Rokeach and [[Melvin Defleur]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=[[Communication Research (journal)|Communication Research]]|year=1976|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is grounded in classical sociological literature positing that media and their audiences should be studied in the context of larger social systems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Efficacy on the Internet: A Media System Dependency Approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/2193885/Political_Efficacy_on_the_Internet_A_Media_System_Dependency_Approach|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|accessdate=5 May 2014|author=Ognyanova, K.|author2=Ball-Rokeach, S. J.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSD ties together the interrelations of broad [[Social system|social systems]], [[mass media]], and the individual into a comprehensive explanation of media effects. At its core, the basic dependency hypothesis states that the more a person depends on media to meet needs, the more important media will be in a person's life, and therefore the more effects media will have on a person. 
 
==The relationships between components==
Dependency on media emerges from three relationships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Alan M|author2=Windahl, S|title=The uses and dependency model of mass communication|journal=[[Critical Studies in Media Communication]]|year=1986|volume=3|pages=184–199|doi=10.1080/15295039609366643}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''The relationship between the society and the media:''' Within this relationship, media access and availability are regarded as important antecedents to an individual's experience with the media. The nature of media dependence on societal systems varies across political, economic, and cultural system.
#'''The relationship between the media and the audience:''' This relationship is the key variable in this theory because it affects how people might use a mass medium. This relationship also varies across media systems. The more salient the information needs, the stronger are the motivation to seek mediated information and the dependency on the medium. In result, the likelihood for the media to affect audiences becomes greater.
#'''The relationship between the society and the audience:''' The societies influence consumers' needs and motives for media use, and provide norms, values, knowledge, and laws for their members. Social system can function an alternatives to the media by offering similar services of the media.

==Media needs and media dependency==
===Three types of needs===
According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=In G. Gumpert &amp; R.S. Cathart, (eds.), Inter/Media: Interpersonal communication in a media world.|year=1979|pages=81–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; three media needs determine how important media is to a person at any given moment:
#The need to understand one's social world (surveillance)
#The need to act meaningfully and effectively in that world (social utility)
#The need to escape from that world when tensions are high (fantasy-escape)

When these needs for media are high, the more people turn to media to meet these needs, and therefore the media have a greater opportunity to affect them. That said, none of these media needs are constant over long periods of time. They change based on aspects of our social environment.

===Two basic conditions for heightened media needs===
Media dependency theory states two specific conditions under which people's media needs, and consequently people's dependency on media and the potential for media effects, are heightened.

The first condition of heightened media needs occurs when the number of media and centrality of media functions in a society are high.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; For instance, in modernized countries like the United States, there are many media outlets and they serve highly centralized social functions. In the United States alone, the media act as a "fourth branch" of government, an alarm system during national emergencies, and as a tool for entertainment and escape, whereas in the underdeveloped world the media are not as numerous and serve far fewer functions. As such, the media have a greater opportunity to serve needs and exert effects in contemporary America than in a third world country.

The second condition of heightened media needs occurs when a society is undergoing social change and conflict. When there is a war or large-scale public protests like during Vietnam or the Arab Spring, a national emergency like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowery|first=W|title=Media dependency during a large-scale social disruption: The case of September 11|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=339–357|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0703_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hindman|first=DB|title=Media system dependency and public support for the press and president|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=1|pages=29–42|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina, people turn to media to help understand these important events. Consequently, the media have a greater opportunity to exert effects during these times of social change and conflict.

==The effects of media message==
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur suggests that the cognitive, behavioral and affective consequences of media use
are premised upon characteristics of both individuals and their social environment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Cognitive===
There are five types of cognitive effects that will be exerted on audiences, the first of which is the creation and resolution of ambiguity. Ambiguity occurs when audiences receive inadequate or incomplete information about their social world. When there is high ambiguity, stress is created, and audiences are more likely to turn to mass media to resolve ambiguity. Ambiguity might be especially prevalent during times of social change or conflict.

The second effect is agenda-setting. This is another reason why we might call dependency a "comprehensive" theory of media effects&amp;nbsp;– it incorporates the entire theory of agenda-setting within its theoretical framework. Like any other effect, media agenda-setting effects should be heightened during times when the audience's needs and therefore dependency on media are high. So, for instance, if our informational needs and dependency on media was high during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, we would have been more susceptible to agenda-setting effects, and we would have therefore perceived the Iraq War as the most important problem (MIP) facing the United States.

Third is attitude formation. Media exposes us to completely new people, such as political figures and celebrities, not to mention physical objects like birth control pills or car safety mechanisms that we come to form attitudes about. Dependency does not suggest media are monolithic in their ability to influence attitudes, but the theory does suggest that media play a role in selecting objects and people for which people form attitudes about. If a person is experiencing greater media dependency, we would therefore expect that the person will form more (or more complex) attitudes about these attitude-objects than people with low media dependency.

Media also have the potential cognitive effect of expanding people's belief systems. Media can create a kind of "enlargement" of citizen's beliefs by disseminating information about other people, places, and things. Expansion of people's belief systems refers to a broadening or enlarging of beliefs in a certain category. For example, a constant flow of information about global warming will expand people's beliefs about pollution affecting the earth's atmosphere, about cap and trade and other policies, and about personal contributions to global warming. These beliefs meet with and are incorporated into an existing value system regarding religion, free enterprise, work, ecology, patriotism, recreation, and the family.

Last is value clarification and conflict. Media help citizens clarify values (equality, freedom, honesty, forgiveness) often by precipitating information about value conflicts. For instance, during the 1960s the mass media regularly reported on the activities of the Civil Rights movement, presenting conflicts between individual freedoms (e.g., a businessman's property rights to deny blacks entrance) and equality (e.g., human rights). When such conflicts play out in the mass media, the value conflicts are identified, resulting in audiences forming their own value positions. Such a position can be painful to articulate because it can force a choice between mutually incompatible goals and the means for obtaining them. However, in the process of trying to decide which is more important in a particular case, general value priorities can become clarified.

===Affective===
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur mentions several possible affective media effects that are more likely to occur during times of heightened dependency.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; First is desensitization, which states that prolonged exposure to violent content can have a "numbing" effect on audiences, promoting insensitivity or the lack of desire toward helping others when violent encounters happen in real life.

Second, exposure to news messages or TV dramas that portray crime-ridden cities can increase people's fear or anxiety about living in or even traveling to a city.

Media can also have effects on morale and feelings of alienation. The degree of positive or negative mass media depictions of social groups can cause fluctuations in people's sense of morale in belonging to that group or in their sense of alienation from that group.

===Behavioral===
There are two broad categories of behavioral effects that Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur identify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The first broad category is called "activation" effects, which refer to instances in which media audiences do something they would not otherwise have done as a consequence of receiving media messages. Behavioral effects are largely thought to work through cognitive and affective effects. For instance, a woman reading a news story about sexism in the workplace might form an attitude toward sexism that creates a negative emotional state, the culmination of which is joining a women's rights march in her local community.

The second broad category of behavioral effects is called "deactivation", and refers to instances in which audiences would have otherwise done something, but don't do as a consequence of media messages. For example, the primary presidential campaign has become longer and increasingly use more media to target audiences. As such, primary campaigns might elicit negative attitudes toward the electoral process and negative affective states such as boredom or disgust that in turn might make a person not turn out to vote.

==The levels of media dependency==
In the MSD view, the media system has two-way resource-dependency relations with individuals (micro-level), groups and organizations (meso-level), and other social systems (macro-level).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|title=The origins of individual media-system dependency: a sociological framework| journal=Communication research|year=1985|volume=12|issue=4|pages=485–510|doi=10.1177/009365085012004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The microlevel (individual level)===
Microlevel, or individual level application, focuses on the relationship between individuals and media. The microlevel dependency, better known as individual level media system dependency (IMD), begins with an assessment of the types of motivation that bring individuals to use the media.
In the perspective of IMD, goals are preferred to needs to conceptualize the motivations that affect media behavior. According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur, goals are the key dimension of individual motivation. While needs imply both rational and irrational motives, goals imply a problem-solving motivation more appropriate to a theory of media behavior based upon the dependency relation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Three types of motivational goals====
The IMD approach provides a comprehensive conceptualization of three motivational goals: understanding, orientation, and play.
#Understanding – needs for individuals to have a basic understanding of themselves and the world around them.
#Orientation – needs for individuals to direct personal actions effectively and interact successfully with others.
#play(or recreation) – a way through which one learns roles, norms, and values and its reflected in such activities as sport, dance, and celebration.

===The macrolevel===
Every country's media system is interdependent on the country's other social systems (e.g., its economy, its government) for resources, and vice versa. At the macrolevel, dependency theory states these interrelationships influence what kinds of media products are disseminated to the public for consumption, and the range of possible uses people have for media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

====Media and economic system====
The media depend on a society's economic system for 1) inculcation and reinforcement of free enterprise values, 2) establishing and maintaining linkages between producers and sellers, and 3) controlling and winning internal conflicts, such as between management and unions. In turn, the media is dependent on a society's economic system for 1) profit from advertising revenue, 2) technological developments that reduce costs and compete effectively with other media outlets, and 3) expansion via access to banking and finance services, as well as international trade.

====Media and political system====
A society's media and political system are also heavily interdependent. Political system rely on the media to 1) inculcate and reinforce political values and norm such as freedom, voting, or obedience to the law, 2) maintain order and social integration, 3) organize and mobilize citizens to carry out essential activities like waging war, and 4) controlling and winning conflicts that develop within political domains (e.g., Watergate). Conversely, the media rely on a country's political system for judicial, executive, and legislative protection, formal and informal resources required to cover the news, and revenue that comes from political advertising and subsidies.

====Media and secondary systems====
To a lesser extent, media has established interdependencies with several other social systems. The family is dependent on media for inculcation and reinforcement of family values, recreation and leisure, coping with everyday problems of child rearing, marriage, and financial crises. On the other hand, the media is dependent on the family for consuming their media products.

The same is true of media and religious systems. Religious systems rely on media for inculcation and reinforcement of religious values, transmitting religious messages to the masses, and successfully competing with other religious or nonreligious philosophies. In turn, the media relies on the religious system to attain profits from religious organizations who purchase space or air time.

The educational system in a society relies on media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging successful conflicts or struggles for scarce resources, and knowledge transmission such as in educational media programming. Media depends on the educational system for access to expert information and being able to hire personnel trained in the educational system.

Finally, the military system depends on the media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging and winning conflicts, and specific organizational goals such as recruitment and mobilization. The media, in turn, depends on the military for access to insider or expert information.

The consequences of all of these interdependencies, again, are alterations in media products that audiences consume. In this way, the system-level interdependencies control media products, the range of possible social uses for media, the extent to which audiences depend on the media to fulfill needs, and ultimately media effects on audiences. Individual differences due to demographics or personality traits might change what people actually do with media messages or how they interpret media messages, but the messages always begin as the result of interdependent social systems.

==Comparison with use and gratification theory==
Ball-Rokeach summarized the major differences between uses and gratification (U&amp;G) theory and media system dependency (MSD) theory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Conception of audience members===
Both U&amp;G and MSD theorists view the audience member as active, but the basic conceptions of the audience member differ. U&amp;G theorists focus on psychological and sociodemographic origins of differences in media use. In this perspective, the variability of text interpretation suggests an audience member in charge of the text.

MSD theorists focus on psychological, interpersonal, and sociological origins of differences in micro MSD relations as well as the macro MSD relations that constrain media text production and individual's MSD relations. The responsiveness of micro MSD relations to environmental conditions and the ecological constraints on media production and consumption are important features. In this perspective, the audience member is neither in charge of the text nor controlled by the text. The only way we can predict the effects is the audiences' MSD relations in context of the ecology of macro relations.

===Conception of interpersonal networks and communication===
U&amp;G theorists emphasize the role of interpersonal communication in the distortion of media messages and of networks as interpretive communities. In this conception, interpersonal networks are regarded as a safety way against the cultural apparatus of the media and its partners. They believe that the interpersonal network contributes to individual "agency", and the "networked" individual is empowered to manipulate media texts, not to be manipulated by them.

The MSD conception is compatible with the U&amp;G conception up to a point. Consistent with MSD conceptions of the individual member of the active media audience, the interpersonal networks play major roles in MSD theory. They link the individual to public and they link and influence the nature of the individual's relations with the media system.

===Conception of the media system and of media power===
U&amp;G theorists in the psychological tradition think of the media system as creators of tentative texts subject to multiple reconstructions. In this perspective, the media system is functional to the extent that it is useful or affords ways for individuals to gratify needs.

The MSD conception is closer to a macro functionalist version of U&amp;G. MSD shares the macro functionalists' view of the media's interdependence with other social and cultural system. In this view, the function of media is seen as a key structure for vertical and horizontal integration of society. The MSD viewpoints seem to be even closer to cultural studies traditions in that the central concern for structural relations of control over information resources that generate the power to create social realities and to negotiate social conflict and social change.

===Methods of observation, analysis, and interpretation===
Although both U&amp;G and MSD researchers ask similar questions of individuals, they do so for very different reasons. Those differences are reflected most clearly in (a) the logics of hypothesis formation (b) item and scale construction (c) modes of data analysis, and (d) interpretation of findings.

The MSD researcher essentially wants to know the micro and macro determinants of stability and change in micro MSD relations to learn something about their cross-level consequences for individuals and their interpersonal networks-the dynamics of their inner worlds and how they live in their social worlds. The U&amp;G theorist wants to learn something about the individual's attraction to media texts and the interaction between text and reader to better understand the contributions of reader characteristics to text processing. The differences between micro U&amp;G and micro MSD are, thus, in their epistemological origins, assumptions, concepts, and missions.

==Theoretical applications in social media==
===New media dependency (NMD)===
The characteristics of new media, including social media domain and the unique contents available through participatory use, as adding to the measure of individual dependency relation (IMD), are treated as the mediator. This cognitive process of mediating IMD is called new media dependency (NMD). Age and the popularity of online contents are seen as influential to NMD, in which younger people show higher NMD especially on popular content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Yoonwhan|year=2009|title=New media uses and dependency effect model: exploring the relationship between new media use habit, dependency relation, and possible outcomes|url=https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/25730/PDF/1/|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Rutgers University-Graduate School-New Brunswick|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cross-level===
====Inevitable limitations====
#The mass media centered framework.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ball-Rokeach, S.J. &amp; Jung, J-Y, (2009). The Evolution of Media System dependency theory. In R. Nabi and M. B. Oliver,'' Sage Handbook of Media Processes and Effects''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Its theoretical assumption of asymmetry between mass media and individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
However, the communication environment has changed as social media provides more choices for people to actively select information generated by other people, instead of passively receiving from satellites and cable channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Cross-level analysis of social media====
Three basic factors of MSD – individual characteristics, social environment, and media system activity – are derived from both micro and macro levels in a society, postulating media remained on a single level. However, the functionality of social media has been suggested as crossing those levels. Through social media, users are able to create the story (on the micro level), and the story can be either shared publicly (on the macro level) or not. Thus, social media gain the ability to move across levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Joo-Young, J., Moro, M., Jung, J. Y., &amp; Munehito, M. (2012). Cross-level analysis of social media: Toward the construction of an ecological framework. ''国際基督教大学学報. II-B, 社会科学ジャーナル'', 73, 53-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The argument about studies in social media===
Particularly, there are lots of MSD studies in online social networking sites ranging from MySpace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrock|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Myspace Or Ourspace: A Media System Dependency View Of Myspace|url=|journal=Doctoral dissertation, University of Central Florida|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, J. Y. (2012). Social media use and goals after the Great East Japan Earthquake. ''First Monday'', ''17''(8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ha, L., Yoon, K., &amp; Zhang, X. (2013). Consumption and dependency of social network sites as a news medium: A comparison between college students and general population. ''Journal of Communication and Media Research'', ''5''(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, scholars still have concerns about whether it is appropriate or not to apply MSD for studying the use of social media.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/27/from-media-dependency-system-to-communication-infrastructure-theory/comment-page-1/|title=Can media system dependency account for social media? Or should communication infrastructure theory take care of it?|last=Matei|first=Sorin Adam|date=27 July 2010|website=I Think|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that MSD accounts for social media, giving reasons that:
#MSD provides a framework for the many relationships through which information can flow in social media environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
#In the case of social media, the power is dependent on the relationship between the provider of information and the consumer of information, rather than in specific people or positions, which is consistent with what MSD suggests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
On the contrary, others challenge that MSD does not fit well with social media studies, because:
#Unlike the one-to-many aspect of traditional mass media, social media's many-to-many nature determines that it is difficult to find out who or what is the original generators producing and spreading messages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
#MSD is inadequate for studying social media as it "mainly accounting for mass media and reducing interpersonal networks to effect gauges".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Baran and Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baran, S.J.|author2=Davis, D.K.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Mass communication theory: Foundation, ferment, and the future|year=2008|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify four primary criticisms of dependency theory:
#Variability in microlevel and macrolevel measurement makes between-study comparability problematic.
#The theory is often difficult to empirically verify.
#The meaning and power of dependency is sometimes unclear.
#Dependency theory lacks power in explaining long-term effects.

'''Mediated deliberation''' is a form of deliberation that is achieved through the [[News media|media]] which acts as a mediator between the mass public and elected officials.  The communication professionals of the media relay information, values, and diverse points of view to the public in order for effective public deliberation to occur.&lt;ref name="John Gastil"&gt;Gastil, John. Political Communication and Deliberation. Los Angeles: Sage Publications, 2008. 43-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin Page proposes mediated deliberation be a "division of labor" with the idea of using the media to deliver information between the elected officials and the public because modern problems make it impossible to rely on the elected officials to deliberate for the public.  The role of the media is to encourage discussion amongst the citizens to keep them engaged with their elected officials.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page"&gt;Page, Benjamin I. 1996. ''Who deliberates? Mass media in modern democracy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal form ==

Mediated deliberation follows the conception of a [[deliberative democracy]].  According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], a German philosopher, "no modern political process could function effectively without the "professionals of the media system" and the various elites who produce mediated political communication." &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; This ideal mediated deliberation would:&lt;blockquote&gt;
to mobilize and pool relevant issues and required information, and to specify interpretations; to process such contributions discursively by means of proper arguments for and against; and to generate rationally motivated ''yes'' and ''no'' attitudes [i.e., public opinions] that are expected to determine the outcome of procedurally correct decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showFullText?submitFullText=Full+Text+HTML&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fj.1468-2885.2006.00280.x&amp;cookieSet=1] Jürgen Habermas (2006) Political Communication in Media Society: Does Democracy Still Enjoy an Epistemic Dimension? The Impact of Normative Theory on Empirical Research Communication Theory 16 (4), 411–426&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Through this ideal model, mediated deliberation should promote public knowledge on important issues as well as encouraging public opinion through enlightenment.

To achieve an effective mediated deliberation, it requires collective responsibility from the media producers, including newspapers, television broadcasters, and the internet.  The media needs to reliable because many people gain information and knowledge about events and issues.  Robert Goodwin, a philosopher, described the idea of "deliberation within" which is the deliberation that occurs in an individual's mind.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; "The point in having a deliberative media process is for individuals to hear conflicting considerations and weigh them to arrive at their own judgments." &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Through the analytic and social processes of deliberation, the table shows the roles that the media producers and media users need to fulfill in order for the ideal, mediated deliberation to occur.  In the analytic process, it involves introspection on subjective values while reflecting on personal and emotional experiences with facts.  The following tables are copyrighted © 2008 by Sage Publications, Inc from John Gastil’s book, ''Political Communication and Deliberation.''  
{| class="wikitable"
'''''Analytic Process'''''&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;
|-
! 
! ''Media Producers''
! ''Media Users''
|-
| Create a solid information base.
| Present media users with a broad base of background information by reporting extensively on important issues.
| Seek out opportunities to learn of others' experiences and relevant expert analysis.
|-
|Prioritize the key values at stake.
|Explore the underlying public concerns behind the surface facts and events that define an issue.
|Consider the diverse concerns underlying issues and how others prioritize issues differently.
|-
|Identify a broad range of solutions.
|Present the broadest possible range of solutions to problems, including nongovernmental and unpopular ones.
|Learn about how people like or unlike yourself think about addressing a problem.
|-
|Weigh the pros, cons, and trade-offs among solutions.
|Report different viewpoints but do more than juxtapose them; subject them to careful scrutiny.
|Reassess your biases favoring or opposing different solutions by seeing how others weigh pros and cons.
|-
|Make the best decision possible.
|Make recommendations but keep editorial content distinct from news; leave the decision to the media user.
|Take responsibility for making up your own mind after listening to the advice of experts, partisans, and others.

Along with the analytic process, the social process involves more equal access and comprehension while considering other diverse points of view.

| Respect other participants.
| Model respect for different views; treat readers with respect by making news serious but engaging
| Give the benefit of the doubt to sources but demand better behavior from those who violate your trust

The analytic and social processes for mediated deliberation gives people the opportunity to evaluate the actions of media producers as well as their users.

==Assessing mediated deliberation==

===Examples of a non-deliberative media===

====Jon Stewart on ''Crossfire''====
As the host of "[[The Daily Show]]," [[Jon Stewart]] appeared on [[CNN]]'s former show ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004.  Instead of discussing current events, Stewart argued that ''Crossfire'' "fails miserably" at providing its viewer audience with balanced information about politics. ''Crossfire'' "presented itself as part of the deliberative process yet engaged in "partisan hackery," Stewart concluded "[it was not an honest debate]".&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Stewart accused ''Crossfire'' of not upholding the "responsibility to the public discourse" and instead, it appeared to be a political theater. In response to Stewart's remarks, CNN canceled ''Crossfire'' in 2005.

====Critiques of the media====
Lance Bennett noticed that the media tend to not present balanced viewpoints for current events.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, Bennett's research showed the media coverage to represent only one, popular political party without a strong opposition party.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

Benjamin Page analyzed the 1991 U.S. war against Iraq in the ''[[New York Times]]'' from November 9, 1990 to January 15, 1991 to examine whether or not the stories covered by the media were balanced and fair. Page wanted to see if there were a diversity of views about the war from a variety of sources.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; As a result, the editors and regular columnists consumed most of the ''Times'' in the most read sections of the paper while ordinary citizens' voices were placed in the Letters section. Page noted that few experts on the Middle East or peace groups were presented in columns even though the ''Times'' 's editors were evenly balanced among three views of the conflict with Iraq: entirely peaceful solution; the U.S. should continue to use economic sanctions followed by military intervention, if necessary; and immediate use of force.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Page concluded that although the media were balanced with the three views of the editors, other major viewpoints were not included. For example, the overwhelming majority of the ''Times'' 's readers supported a more peaceful stance but their views "were not presented in proportion to their adherents among the general public".&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Instead, their letters were presented in the Letters section which is less read than where the editors' and regular columnists' articles are located.  

Page criticizes the media for having "different media outlets [taking] distinctive political stands." &lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt;  Television programs tend to take stands in a more muted and subtle way through verbal statements while printed sources present their ideologies in relation to the interests of their audience over time.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt; In addition, Page notes that "''certain media outlets''--especially newspapers and magazines, but sometimes also television program networks--do not merely reflect the social and political forces around them; instead, they ''actively work to shape political discourse to their own purposes.''"&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt; The media would emphasize points about a story that they want to make.

==Movement shift toward mediated deliberation==

===Civic/public journalism===
[[Civic journalism]] (sometimes called public journalism) is a movement that peaked in the 1990s as an attempt to reconnect with democracy and to increase persons' trust in journalism by being more debatable, neutral, and independent with an issue.  As attempts to achieve these goals, newspapers "redesigned their coverage to emphasize the concerns of citizens"; encourage citizens to discuss public issues, and change techniques in newsgathering and reporting.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

On January 25, 2003, the Public Journalism Network in Georgia established a declaration which made it clear that journalists believed in maintaining these changes in journalism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Public Journalism Network brings together a diverse group of print and electronic media organizations that share the same general goal of connecting with the public they serve and promoting not just media deliberation but also the kinds of conversations, discussions, and public meetings" &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In brief, the [http://pjnet.org/charter/ Public Journalism Network Charter] states:&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Declaration: a Declaration for Public Journalism." Public Journalism Network. 25 Jan. 2003. 20 May 2008 &lt;http://pjnet.org/charter/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We believe journalism and democracy work best when news information and ideas flow freely; news fairly portrays a full range and variety of life and culture of all communities; when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified, and when news helps people function as political actors and not just political consumers...journalists should stand apart in making sound professional judgment and should not stand apart in learning about and understanding these communities...new techniques for storytelling and information-sharing to help individual communities to have their own voice as a whole set of communities...stories and images can help or hinder as people struggle to reach sound judgments about personal lives and well-being...to reach deeper into communities and serve people...listen to people...study dynamics of communities and the complexity of public life...journalism helps people see the world as a whole and helps them take responsibility for what they see." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Citizen Voices Project===
Modeling after the [[National Issues Forums]], Citizen Voices was a Philadelphian newspaper's "attempt to engage" across the diverse city during a 1999 mayoral race between a white Republican against a black Democrat.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks"&gt;Hendriks, Carolyn. The Deliberative Democracy Handbook: Strategies for Effective Civic Engagement in the 21st Century. 1st ed. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; After noticing skewed responses from more educated and affluent white readers in this racially divided city, Citizen Voices aimed to encourage more public involvement from lower class minorities by creating a citizens’ issues-oriented mayoral campaign. To invite participants from all backgrounds, Citizen Voices invented "The Oprah Show" as a comedic parody of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" as a way to get citizens to think about problems and solutions within their city. The second phase of the project included a National Issues Forum-style discussion where citizens deliberated on position papers that the mayoral candidates submitted and drafted five issues with their questions for the mayoral debate including: education, jobs, neighborhoods, public safety, and reforming city hall.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt; The issue of race was added to these five topics due to race relations complicating Philadelphia's effort to address its problems. "Throughout the year, Citizen Voices remained a frequent presence on ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' 's opinion pages."&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt; Editorials on the campaign revolved around the issues that were picked by Citizens Voices and were even published on the commentary page in full-page layouts. Candidates were asked to respond to these questions on the issues that were drafted by citizens. As a result, it appeared that low-income participants were more willing and more confident to express their political views.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt;

===Investigative journalism===
One of the best sources to see an example of a mediated deliberation is [[investigative journalism]]. The media responds and reports events that generate a lot of public concern or interests. In investigative journalism, the media conducts their own original research and investigation to uncover a news story that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Sometimes, it is triggered from a reporter's hunch or even an outside source. For example, the ''Washington Post'' 's articles revealing the [[Watergate scandal]] involving President [[Richard Nixon]] through the famous "Deep Throat" outside source. Over the years, investigative reporting has steadily declined. In 2002, about one in 150 stories accounted for investigative journalism compared to one in 60 in 1998.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; This reduction has been caused by many factors including: 
*the increase in [[profit motive]] to produce news that will attract the most audience attention
*the perception that the investigative reporting is not increasing audience size nor loyalty
*libel suits involving the investigative stations 
*an increased demand on entertaining news 
&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

Assuming the reports are valid, investigative journalism can improve mediated deliberation by serving as an objective, unbiased source. Reporters may present the necessary information and facts of an issue needed for individuals to decide the whether or not future action needs to take place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">An '''open-access repository''' or '''open archive''' is a digital platform that holds research output and provides free, immediate and permanent access to research results for anyone to use, download and distribute. To facilitate [[open access]] such repositories must be [[interoperable]] according to the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH). [[Search engines]] harvest the content of open access repositories, constructing a database of worldwide, free of charge available research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Neil| title = Open Access: Key Strategic, Technical and Economic Aspects| publisher = Elsevier| date = 2006| pages = 11| url = https://www.elsevier.com/books/open-access/jacobs/978-1-84334-203-8| isbn = 9781843342038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to a simple [[institutional repository]] or [[disciplinary repository]], open-access repositories provide free access to research for users outside the institutional community and are one of the recommended ways to achieve the [[open access]] vision described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the [[self-archiving]] or "green" route to open access.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of open-access repositories, as opposed to conventional digital [[institutional repositories]], are:
* Opening up outputs of the institution to a worldwide audience;
* Maximizing the visibility and impact of these outputs as a result;
* Showcasing the institution to interested constituencies – prospective staff, prospective students and other stakeholders;
* Collecting and curating digital output;
* Managing and measuring research and teaching activities;
* Providing a workspace for work-in-progress, and for collaborative or large-scale projects;

'''Overkill''' is the use of excessive force or action that goes further than what is necessary to achieve its goal. It implies that, while the goal was accomplished, there was [[collateral damage]] as a result. It may be a literal term referring to physical damage, though it is also used in colloquial conversation as a metaphor. An example is killing an ant with a sledgehammer.
[[Image:Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (with scientists).jpg|right|thumb|[[Medium Atomic Demolition Munition|A nuclear land mine]] is an example of overkill.]]
[[File:Tank Bunny Death.jpg|right|thumb|This picture of a tank shooting a bunny (in the face) represents the core concept of overkill.]]

==Nuclear weapons==
''Overkill'' is especially used to refer to a [[nuclear weapon|destructive nuclear capacity]] exceeding the amount needed to destroy an enemy.&lt;ref name="EOP, K1"&gt;&lt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/overkill&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is attested from 1946&lt;ref name="EOP, K2"&gt;"overkill." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Mar. 2009. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/overkill&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in common use during the [[Cold War]] era, referring to the [[arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Both nations possessed (and still do) more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy one another many times over &amp;mdash; nuclear overkill.
The term for this was "pounding the rubble" or, as military officers sometimes joked, "pounding the [[ruble]]".

==In video games==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:2006-09-26_23h20m54.png|thumb|PC-Game - [[Alien Shooter 2]], [[Flamethrower]] Overkill]] --&gt;
Overkill is a common feature implemented in many video games, typically representing the fact that the damage a single attack inflicted on an enemy or player character far exceeded the character's remaining health points. In many [[first-person shooter]]s, starting with ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', overkilling a character results in "[[Gib (video gaming)|gibbing]]" - the character exploding in a shower of gore.

== Terpenoids ==
[[File:Verbenone3D.png|thumb|The [[terpenoid]] [[verbenone]] is a plant [[pheromone]], signalling to insects that a tree is already infested by beetles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Mafra-Neto | first1=Agenor| last2=de Lame | first2=Frédérique M.  | last3=Fettig | first3=Christopher J. | last4=Perring | first4=Thomas M. | last5=Stelinski | first5=Lukasz L.  | last6=Stoltman | first6=Lyndsie L.| last7=Mafra | first7=Leandro E.

{{further|Terpenoid}}

Terpenoids facilitate communication between plants and insects, mammals, fungi, microorganisms, and other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Llusià |first=Joan |last2=Estiarte |first2=Marc |last3=Peñuelas |first3=Josep |date=1996 |title=Terpenoids and plant communication |journal=Bull. Inst. Cat. Hist. Nat |volume=64 |pages=125–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terpenoids may act as both attractants and repllants for various insects. For example, pine shoot beetles (''[[Tomicus piniperda]]'') are attracted to certain monoterpenes ( (+/-)-[[A-Pinene|a-pinene]], (+)-[[Carene|3-carene]] and terpinolene) produced by Scots pines ''([[Scots pine|Pinus sylvestris]]''), while being repelled by others (such as [[verbenone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.

The structure  of terpenoids is described by the [[biogenetic isoprene rule]] which states that terpenoids can be thought of being made of [[isoprenoid]] subunits, arranged either regularly or irregularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The isoprene rule and the biogenesis of terpenic compounds |first=Leopold |last=Ružička |journal=[[Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences]] |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=357–367 |year=1953 |doi=10.1007/BF02167631 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02167631}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biosynthesis of terpenoids occurs via the [[Non-mevalonate pathway|methylerythritol phosphate]] (MEP) and  [[Mevalonate pathway|mevalonic acid]](MVA) pathways&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; both of which include [[Isopentenyl pyrophosphate|isopentenyl diphosphate]] (IPP) and [[Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate|dimethylallyl diphosphate]] (DMAPP) as key compenents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McGarvey |first=Douglas J. |last2=Croteau |first2=Rodney |date=July 1995 |title=Terpenoid Metabolism |jstor=3870054 |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=7 |pages=1015–1026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEP pathway produces [[hemiterpene]]s, [[monoterpene]]s, [[diterpene]]s, and volatile [[carotenoid]] derivatives while the MVA pathway produces [[sesquiterpene]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Plug &amp; Pray''''' is a 2010 documentary film about the promise, problems and ethics of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]]. The main protagonists are the former [[MIT]] professor [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] and the futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]]. The title is a pun on the computer hardware phrase "[[Plug and play#Plug and Play|Plug and Play]]".

== Synopsis ==
Computer experts around the world strive towards the development of intelligent robots. Pioneers like Raymond Kurzweil and [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] dream of fashioning intelligent machines that will equal their human creators. In this potential reality, man and machine merge as a single unity. Rejecting evolution's biological shackles tantalisingly dangles the promise of eternal life for those bold enough to seize it. But others, like [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], counterattack against society's limitless faith in the redemptive powers of technology, questioning the prevailing discourses on new technologies and their ethical relationships to human life. The film delves into a world where computer technology, robotics, biology, neuroscience, and developmental psychology merge, and features roboticists in their laboratories in Japan, the USA, Italy and Germany.

== Background ==
Since antiquity, mankind has dreamed of creating brilliant machines. The invention of the computer and the breathtaking pace of technological progress appear to be bringing the realisation of this dream within the grasp of humans. Robots were to do the housework, look after the children, care for the elderly, and go to war. Former MIT professor [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], creator of [[ELIZA]], has become a harsh critic of their visions of technological omnipotence.

Production of the film started in 2006 and ended in 2009. The death of the main protagonist Joseph Weizenbaum on March 5, 2008, fell in this period. The international festival premiere was at [[FIPA]] 2010 in Biarritz, France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909091740/http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programmes/2010/doc_21146.htm Program of FIPA 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the film has been invited to 27 film festivals, among them the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], [[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver Film Festival]], [[Visions du Réel]]. The theatrical release in Germany was on Nov. 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kino.de/kinofilm/plug-pray/100518.html#start kino.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
The film won the [[Bavarian Film Award]] 2010 for "best documentary", the Grand Prix of the Jury for the best film at the Paris International Science Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pariscience.fr Film Festival Pariscience]&lt;/ref&gt;  the Primer Premio for best film at the Mostra de Ciencia e Cinema in La Coruña (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cienciaecinema.org Mostra de Ciencia e Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Science Communication Award at the International Science Film Festival Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caid.gr/isffa/awards.html International Science Film Festival Athens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028102045/http://www.caid.gr/isffa/awards.html |date=2010-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also chosen as the best international film at the 46th AFO, Science Documentary Festival in Olomouc, Czech Republic, in 2011.

}}

In [[broadcasting]], '''public affairs''' [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] or [[television program]]s focus on matters of [[politics]] and [[public policy]].  Among [[commercial broadcaster]]s, such programs are often only to satisfy [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulatory expectations and are not [[Broadcast programming|scheduled]] in [[prime time]].  Public affairs television programs are usually broadcast at times when few listeners or viewers are tuned in (or even awake) in the [[United States|U.S.]], in time slots known as [[graveyard slot]]s; such programs can be frequently encountered at times such as 5-6 a.m. on a Sunday.

Public affairs coverage is carried as [[digital subchannel]]s of existing [[state network]] [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) member [[public television]] stations.

[[Government-access television]] (GATV) is cable [[channel capacity]] for local government bodies and other legislative entities to access the cable television systems to televise public affairs meetings.

At some (particularly national) broadcasters, "Public Affairs" may be a special unit, separate from the news department, dedicated to producing long-form public-affairs programming, as at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] prior to 1992. As of 2012, [[C-SPAN]]'s three networks are the most widely known and widely available public affairs channels in the United States.

A '''public auction''' is an [[auction]] held on behalf of a [[government]] in which the property to be auctioned is either property owned by the government, or property which is sold under the authority of a [[court of law]] or a government agency with similar authority.

When the term "[[government auctions|Government Auction]]" is used it generally means that specific auctioneers and agents are contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies.

==Sale of property owned by the government==

Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, [[abandoned property]] over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by [[escheat]], [[government land]], and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as [[Broadcasting|broadcast frequencies]] sold through a [[spectrum auction]].

Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the [[United States Navy]] [[cruiser]] [[USS Philadelphia (C-4)|''Philadelphia'']] was sold at such an auction at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in 1927.

==Sale of private property in a public auction==
Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a [[mortgage foreclosure]], [[tax lien]], or [[tax sale]]. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed - that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the [[United States]], public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the [[sheriff]] of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a '''Sheriff's sale'''.

[[Real property]] may be subject to a public auction in order to [[Partition (law)|partition]] the property between [[Concurrent estate|joint tenants]] who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An [[estate sale]] conducted at the direction of a [[probate court]] may also be conducted as a public auction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">In the United States, '''public rights''', as compared to [[private rights]], belong to [[citizen]]s but are vested in and vindicated by political entities. Public rights cannot be vindicated by private citizens. A right must normally be a private right to be vindicated in court.

An exception to this general proposition is found in ''[[Flast v. Cohen]]'', 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In ''Flast'', the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that a private citizen could challenge the [[constitutionality]] of a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[tax]] if the citizen established "a logical link between [their] status [as a taxpayer] and the type of legislative enactment attacked [and] . . . a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged." 

In Australia, public rights is an entitlement enjoyed by the community, in contrast to a private or personal entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/results/enhdocview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;ersKey=23_T25586460153&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;startDocNo=0&amp;resultsUrlKey=0_T25586460156&amp;backKey=20_T25586460157&amp;csi=267785&amp;docNo=10&amp;scrollToPosition=583|title=Encyclopaedic Australian Legal Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as a claim to tolls on a public highway,&lt;ref&gt;''Brett v Brales'' [1830] EngR 359 [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1830/359.pdf#search=&amp;#x22;title(brett&amp;#x20;&amp;#x20;beales&amp;#x20;)&amp;#x22; WordLII]&lt;/ref&gt; a right of ferry.&lt;ref&gt;''Pim v Curell'' [1840] EngR 174 [http://www.worldlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/int/cases/EngR/1840/174.pdf?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=title(pim&amp;#x20;and&amp;#x20;curell&amp;#x20;) WordLII]&lt;/ref&gt; Public rights may exist at common law or under statute.

The '''Seshat: Global History Databank''' is an international [[scientific research]] project of the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Evolution Institute]]. Founded in 2011, the [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''Seshat: Global History Databank''] gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a [[Digital humanities|digital storehouse]] for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

The Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of [[Cliodynamics]]. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the [[scientific method]] to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turchin |first=Peter |title= Arise cliodynamics |journal=Nature |date=2008 |doi= 10.1038/454034a |pmid=18596791 |volume=454 |issue=7200 |pages=34–35}} http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural evolutionary theory]] or [[Cultural evolutionism|cultural evolutionary theory]] to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.

== Project ==

The Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of [[social complexity]] in early civilizations, the creation of [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]] (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of [[ritual]] and [[religion]] in [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], the causes of [[economic growth]] and its consequences on individual's [[well-being]], and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge [[Semantic Web|digital technologies]] can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.

Several key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does [[prosocial behavior]] evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info|title=Seshat: Global History Databank - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late [[Neolithic]] (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30/|title=World Sample 30 - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Praise ===

[[Ian Morris (historian)]] recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

[[Gary Feinman]] also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Critics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process. The Seshat project uses multiple coders and experts and other techniques for ensuring data quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collard |first=Mark |last2= Whitehouse |first2= Harvey |last3= Francois |first3= Pieter |last4= Slingerland |first4= Edward |last5= Turchin |first5= Peter |title=A Historical Database of Sociocultural Evolution |journal= Cliodynamics |date=2012 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have recently suggested that machine coding techniques hold great promise for further reducing biases and increasing the reliability of the data produced.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Funding ===

Funding for the Seshat: Global History Databank comes from the [[John Templeton Foundation]], the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[Horizon 2020]], the Tricoastal Foundation, and the Evolution Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-about-us/acknowledgements/|title=Acknowledgements - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

=== Administration ===

The Seshat: Global History Databank is governed by an Editorial Board, which includes Prof. [[Peter Turchin]], Prof. [[Harvey Whitehouse]], Dr. Pieter François, Dr. Thomas E. Currie, and Dr. Kevin C. Feeney.

'''Sexual misconduct''' is an [[umbrella term]] for any [[misconduct]] of a sexual nature that is of lesser offense than felony [[sexual assault]] (such as [[rape]] and [[child molestation|molestation]]), particularly where the situation is normally non-sexual and therefore unusual for sexual behavior, or where there is some aspect of personal power or authority that makes sexual behavior inappropriate. A common theme, and the reason for the term ''misconduct'', is that these violations occur during work or in a situation of a power imbalance. It is a legal concept to frame offenses which are non-criminal but nevertheless violating of another person's personal boundary in the area of sexuality and intimate personal relationships. 

Sexual misconduct is often perpetrated against an individual without their consent or where the power dynamics of the relationship are being challenged in an effort to redefine the nature or form of consent necessary in a given circumstance. The alleged misconduct can be of various degrees, such as exposure, assault, aggressive come-ons, pleading, or even inattentiveness to nonverbal cues of discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Ethical and Legal Terms and Issues'', by Len Sperry, 2007 – Routledge, pages 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The "definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear"  and it is a "lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies", to deal with cases marked by power imbalance, coercion, and predatory behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly? Depends on who you ask |last=Laucius |first=Joanne |date=29 January 2018 |website=ottawacitizen.com |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In legal sense, for a person in a position of authority it includes in particular any [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] between them and one of their subordinates. This commonly includes teachers and their students, [[clergy]] and their congregants, doctors and their patients, and employers and their employees. While such activity is usually not explicitly illegal, it is often against professional [[ethical code]]s. For example, a teacher may be fired and a doctor may have their medical license revoked because of sexual misconduct. In addition, the person in the subordinate position may allege [[sexual harassment]]. The University of Iowa defines sexual misconduct as "...unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion, or manipulation." &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/students/sexual-misconduct-datingdomestic-violence-or-stalking-involving-students/definitions-and-1 |title=Operations Manual |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=opsmanual.uiowa.edu |publisher= University of Iowa|access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering a sexual relationship with a subordinate, even when the contact is initiated by the latter, is considered unethical by some because of the subordinate's vulnerability to the superior and the inequality of power that characterizes the relationship. In the case of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], having a sexual relationship with the patient even after the professional relationship has concluded is considered problematic for the physician because of the potential for the patient's continuing dependence on and [[transference]] towards the physician. Therefore, sexual relationships with former patients are considered unethical by the medical profession when physicians “use or exploit the [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[knowledge]], [[emotion]]s or influence derived from the previous professional relationship” in any way.{{sfn|JAMA|1991}} By contrast, legal ethics permit sexual relations with former client and, in California, with current clients as well so long as the sex is consensual and is not rendered in exchange for legal services. 

Some activities which are not strictly erotic, e.g. [[mooning]] (exposing the buttocks), [[streaking]] (running naked through a public area) and [[skinny dipping]] (swimming naked), are sometimes also categorized as sexual misconduct. Despite these opinions, others believe that sexual relations in workplace settings is not unethical including between boss and employee.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Many companies do not prohibit so-called fraternization but instead recognize the difference between consensual dating and improper behavior.

According to Joanne Laucius from the ''Ottawa Citizen'', the "definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear" and the "word ‘misconduct’ also lacks precision — it can be used as a catch-all for all kinds of behaviour, often obscuring what actually happened". Laucius states that the terms "sexual violence or sexual harassment and assault are much more specific terms that convey the nature of the allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly? Depends on who you ask |last=Laucius |first=Joanne |date=29 January 2018 |website=ottawacitizen.com |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Craig, an associate professor in the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, states that "[s]exual misconduct is a lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies. It covers an array of problematic sexual behaviour including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuse. Two of these terms have specific (and different) legal meanings: Sexual assault has a specific meaning in the criminal law context, unlike sexual misconduct, which may cover both criminal and non-criminal conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly? Depends on who you ask |last=Laucius |first=Joanne |date=29 January 2018 |website=ottawacitizen.com |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Sheehy, the Shirley Greenberg Chair for Women and the Legal Profession at the University of Ottawa, states that "[s]exual misconduct is a social issue and not a fixed line — it shifts as women gain access to economic and political equality. It’s not found under criminal law, in human rights codes, or collective agreements. It might be found under professional disciplinary codes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

Michelle Cottle wrote in ''The Atlantic'' that the "...almost infinite shades of creepy misbehavior on display are challenging the legal and cultural categories used to describe them", as this issue is, in "...some ways, uncharted territory", making it "...hard to tell how the new lines will be drawn, much less where."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/what-does-sexual-misconduct-actually-mean/548807/ |title=What Does 'Sexual Misconduct' Actually Mean?

==Among educators==
[[File:Suzuki Harunobu - Sexual Misconduct, From the book Fashionable, Lusty Mane’emon 1770.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Harunobu]] - "Sexual Misconduct", from the book ''Fashionable, Lusty Mane’emon'', 1770]]

A literature review of educator sexual misconduct published by the US Department of Education found that 9.6% of high school students have experienced some form of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf, the actual 9.6% figure was for 8th-11th grades. Author Charol Shakeshaft extrapolated it to K-12th, which is questionable.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 4% to 43% of cases, the abusers were women. Black, Hispanic, and Native American Indian children are at greatest risk for [[sexual abuse]]. Also at increased risk are children with disabilities; the reason for this may be their greater need for individual attention and their possible problems with communicating.{{sfn|West|Hatters-Friedman|Knoll|2010|pp=9–10}}

Children who have been victims of educator sexual misconduct usually have low [[self-esteem]], and they are likely to develop suicidal ideation and depression. Because the abuser was a person the child was encouraged to trust, they may experience a sense of betrayal.{{sfn|West|Hatters-Friedman|Knoll|2010|pp=9–10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7027">'''Social journalism''' is a media model consisting of a hybrid of professional [[journalism]], contributor and reader content.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sussman|first1=Ed|title=Why Michael Wolff is Wrong|url=http://observer.com/2014/03/why-michael-wolff-is-wrong/|accessdate=10 February 2015|publisher=New York Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[open publishing]] platforms, like [[Twitter]] and [[WordPress.com]], except that some or most content is also created and/or screened by professional journalists. Examples include [[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]], [[Medium (service)|Medium]], [[BuzzFeed]], [https://www.sp-bx.com Soapbox] and [[Gawker Media|Gawker]]. The model, which in some instances has generated monthly audiences in the tens of millions, has been discussed as one way for professional journalism to thrive despite a marked decline in the audience for traditional journalism.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

=="Platishing"==

Writing in [[Re/code]], Jonathan Glick, CEO of Sulia, said the model of publishers as platforms (which he calls a "platisher") is "on the rise". Glick cites as examples Medium (from Twitter co-founders [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and [[Biz Stone]]), [[Vox Media]], Sulia, Skift, [[First Look Media]] (backed by eBay founder [[Pierre Omidyar]]) and BuzzFeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glick|first=Jonathan|title=Rise of the Platishers|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/07/rise-of-the-platishers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=136566982|work=Re/Code|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2014, Mark Little, the CEO of Storyful.com, now a division of News Corp., proposed "10 Principles that Power Social Journalism," including "UGC [User Generated Content] is governed by the same legal and ethical code as any other content" and "The currency of social journalism is authenticity not authority. We are not experts in every subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Little|first=Mark|title=10 Principles that Power Social Journalism|url=http://blog.storyful.com/2014/03/12/ten-principles-that-power-social-journalism/#.UzxieseT4aE|work=Storyful|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alan Rusbridger, said the Guardian was in the process of converting into a platform as well as a publisher. "For years, news organizations had a quasi monopoly on information simply because we had the means of distribution. I think if as a journalist you are not intensely curious about what has been created by people who are not journalists, then you’re missing out on a lot," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chozik|first=Amy|title=The Guardian’s Alan Rusbridger: ‘It’s Essential to Be Paranoid’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/the-guardians-alan-rusbridger-its-essential-to-be-paranoid.html|work=New York Times Sunday Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new rules==

On April 1, 2014, in a column in [[GigaOM]] entitled "Social journalism and open platforms are the new normal — now we have to make them work" Mathew Ingram asked "How can media entities take advantage of this phenomenon without losing their way in the process?" and proceeded to review suggested rules for social journalism proposed by former FastCompany.com president Ed Sussman, an early adopter of the model.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Social Journalism and Open Platforms Are the New Normal - Now We Have to Make Them Work|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/04/01/social-journalism-and-open-platforms-are-the-new-normal-now-we-have-to-make-them-work/|work=Giga Om|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram summarized Sussman's suggestions, including clear labeling types of contributors (e.g. staff, guest contributor, reader contribution); establishing guidelines, such as conflict of interest rules, that posters must consent to before posting; providing wiki-like tools for social improvements to content; elevating the best content with curators and algorithms; deleting weak or problematic content via curators or algorithms.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;

Social journalism has been attacked by media critic Michael Wolff in ''[[USA Today]]'' as the "Forbes vanity model letting ‘contributors’ write whatever they want under your brand (‘as I wrote in Forbes …’) and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Michael|title=New cash, new questions for Business Insider|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/03/16/the-future-of-business-insider/6370473/|work=USA Today|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 20, 2014 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', former [[FastCompany.com]] president Ed Sussman argued that social journalism does not devalue the authority of brands and that the success of Forbes.com in attracting a wide audience with its 1,000+ bloggers proved that the model could be successful for traditional media companies.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; Following revelations that some [[Forbes.com]] contributors used their columns to allegedly participate in a "pump and dump" scheme to promote, then sell stocks, Sussman followed up with "The New Rules of Social Journalism: A Proposal" in [[Pando Daily]], on March 29, 2014. Sussman proposed various rules for elevating the quality and ethics of social journalism content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The New Rules of Social Journalism|url=http://pando.com/2014/03/29/the-new-rules-of-social-journalism-a-proposal/|work=Pando Daily|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adopter==

An early, or perhaps the first "social journalism" platform at a major media company was FastCompany.com, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Ed|title=The Media is Social|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/665030/media-social/|work=FastCompany.com|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the platform launched, in its first six months, FastCompany.com signed up 2,000 bloggers and 50,000 members.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt; "Fast Company is the first, but certainly not last, mainstream publication to integrate the majority of their site as a social community," wrote media analyst Jeremiah Owyang in 2008, then a senior social computing analyst for [[Forrester Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Owyang|first=Jeremiah|title=An Initial Analysis of the Fast Company Community|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/02/09/an-initial-analysis-of-the-fast-company-community/|work=Web Strategist|accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ed Sussman left the website, the [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] print magazine editors reverted it to a standard journalism website.&lt;ref name="Why Michael Wolff is Wrong"/&gt;

{{Sociology}}
{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman History"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman |first=Linton |year=2004 |publisher=Empirical Press |isbn=978-1-59457-714-7 |title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences. Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile (1893). ''De la division du travail social: étude sur l'organisation des sociétés supérieures'', Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as ''The Division of Labor in Society'', New York: Free Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1908). ''Soziologie'', Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.&lt;ref name=jscott /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: {{cite book|authors=Carrington, Peter J. &amp; Scott, John|chapter=Introduction|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis| publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the diagram in {{cite book|author=Scott, John|title=Social Network Analysis: A Handbook|publisher=Sage|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7619-6339-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww3_bKcz6kgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], in the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno]] began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see [[sociometry]]). In [[anthropology]], the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] work of [[Bronislaw Malinowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913). ''The Family Among the Australian Aborigines: A Sociological Study''. London: University of London Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radcliffe-Brown|Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown, Alfred Reginald (1930) ''The social organization of Australian tribes''.

F. Nadel]] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, S. F. 1957. ''The Theory of Social Structure''. London: Cohen and West.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], the early (1930s) work of [[Talcott Parsons]] set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). ''The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott (1951). ''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration". ''The American Journal of Sociology'', (65)6: 545–556, (May).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1964). ''Exchange and Power in Social Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988).

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R. Paula, Raimundo N. Costa Filho, José S. Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=48 "Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance"].

[http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/11/03/reading-list-using-social-network-analysis-sna-in-social-ecological-studies/ ''Resilience Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site? Facebook Use and College Students' Life Satisfaction, Trust, and Participation|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=875–901|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007 |author1=Wang, Hua  |author2=Barry Wellman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Behavioral Scientist | year=2010 | volume=53 | issue=8 | pages=1148–1169 | doi=10.1177/0002764209356247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.&lt;ref name="GaudeulGiannetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudeul|first1=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal|journal=Social Networks|volume=35|issue=3|year=2013|pages=317–330|issn=03788733|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable theorists ==
The study of social systems is integral to the fields of sociology and public policy. Social systems have been studied for as long as sociology has existed.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
[[Talcott Parsons]] was the first to formulate a systematic theory of social systems, which he did as a part of his [[AGIL paradigm]]. He defined a social system as only a segment (or a "subsystem") of what he called [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social System|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Routledge|year=1951|isbn=0-203-99295-4|location=England|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons organized social systems in terms of action units, where one action executed by an individual is one unit. He defines a social system as a network of interactions between actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Parsons, social systems rely on a system of language, and [[culture]] must exist in a society in order for it to qualify as a social system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parsons' work laid the foundations for the rest of the study of social systems theory and ignited the debate over what framework social systems should be built around, such as actions, communication, or other relationships.

=== Niklas Luhmann ===
[[Niklas Luhmann]] was a prominent sociologist and social systems theorist who laid the foundations of modern social system thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=339|title=Observing Society: Meaning, Communication, and Social Systems  By Daniel B. Lee and Achim Brosziewski|website=www.cambriapress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his definition of a "social system" on the mass network of communication between people and defined society itself as an "autopoietic" system, meaning a self-referential and self-reliant system that is distinct from its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMlvNXfpxfoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=social+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Tk1wDUDhX&amp;sig=JWsWpj5thEmyB7Afc3fu-JBTbK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKj8uipq3UAhVi2IMKHZGlDtg4HhDoAQhXMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20systems&amp;f=false|title=Luhmann's "social Systems" Theory: Preliminary Fragments for a Theory of Translation|last=Vermeer|first=Hans J.|date=2006|publisher=Frank &amp; Timme GmbH|isbn=9783865961020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered social systems as belonging to three categories: societal systems, organizations, and interaction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayrhofer|first=Wolfgang|date=2004|title=Social Systems Theory as Theoretical Framework for Human Resource Management – Benediction or Curse?|jstor=41783463|journal=Management Revue|volume=15|issue=2|pages=178–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered societal systems, such as religion, law, art, education, science, etc., to be closed systems consisting of different fields of interaction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Niklas Luhmann and Organizational Studies|last=David Seidl|first=Kai Helge Becker|publisher=CBS press|year=2013|isbn=978-87-630-0304-9|location=Denmark|pages=35–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were defined as a network of decisions which reproduce themselves; his definition is difficult to apply in terms of finding a real-world example.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, interaction systems are systems that reproduce themselves on the basis of communication rather than decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Jay Wright Forrester ===
[[Jay Wright Forrester]] founded the field of [[system dynamics]], which deals with the simulation of interactions in dynamic systems. In his work on social systems, he discusses the possibilities of social system dynamics, or modeling social systems using computers with the aim of testing the possible effects of passing new public policies or laws. In his paper he recognized the difficulty of producing a reliable computer model system, but argued that an imperfect model was better than none and simply implementing new policy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.constitution.org/ps/cbss.htm|title=Jay W. Forrester: Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrester argued that unsuccessful public policies aim to treat the symptoms rather than the causes of social issues and that they also generally focus on  rather than  efforts. This occurs because there is either an incomplete understanding or a misunderstanding of the causes of an issue on the part of the policymakers, which often leads to ineffective or detrimental policies which aggravate the issues they were implemented to correct or cause other issues to arise. Another problem Forrester notes is that some policies which may work in the long run may aggravate an issue in the short run. A successful policy according to Forrester must target the correct leverage points, in this case the aspect of the social problem which, if modified, will produce a sizeable enough effect to correct the problem.

== Modeling ==
One significant problem with studying social systems is the difficulty of forming and testing theories; social systems are not easily manipulated or controlled and large-scale systems cannot be reproduced in a lab setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACKSON|first=MICHAEL C.|date=1985-01-01|title=Social Systems Theory and Practice: The Need for a Critical Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081078508934877|journal=International Journal of General Systems|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=135–151|doi=10.1080/03081078508934877|issn=0308-1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rapid increase in the availability of digital [[data]] over the last decade gives scientists studying the behaviors of social systems very detailed and much more holistic pictures of how social systems respond to various events and how networked social systems behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vespignani|first=Alessandro|date=24 July 2009|title=Predicting the Behavior of Techno-Social Systems|url=http://www.gleamviz.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/science2009.pdf|journal=Science|volume=325|pages=425–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the development and popularity of social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] offer new ways to study the evolution of social systems and social networking behaviors with [[social graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesystemsthinker.com/extending-systems-thinking-to-social-systems/|title=Extending Systems Thinking to Social Systems - The Systems Thinker|date=2016-01-23|work=The Systems Thinker|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the behaviors of these systems may be surprising or not yet well understood, the digital age offers a new frontier for the study of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/multimedia/simons-science-series/online-social-systems/|title=Online Social Systems {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable past models are the WORLD2 and [[World3|WORLD3]] models: these both aimed to outline the world's distribution of resources. WORLD3 was based on the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth|Limits to Growth]].''

{{Original research|date=March 2013}}

A '''social welfare model''' is a system of [[social welfare]] provision and its accompanying [[value system]]. It usually involves [[social policies]] that affect the welfare of a country's citizens within the framework of a market or mixed economy.

==Elements of a social welfare model==

===Taxation===
Taxation is concerned with how the state taxes the people, whether by a [[flat tax]], [[regressive tax]] or a [[progressive tax]] system. The most common guiding rule of taxation is to levy taxes by the ability to pay.

===Social insurance===
Social insurance is concerned with how the state implements [[social welfare|benefits]] for the unemployed, pensions, maternity and paternity leave and [[disabilities]].

===Public services===
Services such as [[health care]] can be almost entirely state funded, private [[insurance]]-based, or somewhere in-between. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has an almost entirely publicly funded health service, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and [[Canada]] offers public health care offered at a [[province|provincial]] level. Conversely, in the [[United States]], individuals have to rely on health insurance policies in the event of hospitalization, and a minimal amount of state support for the poorer people exists. Another element can be [[public transport]], as some countries have nationalized rapid transit systems, while others have privatized them (in the UK for example, public transport has been privatised in [[Great Britain]] but not in [[Northern Ireland]]).

===Employment===
Economies with a more [[laissez-faire]] approach to employment will do nothing to provide job security. Other countries will rely on some degree of [[regulation]] to protect workers from arbitrary firings. A high degree of regulation such as expensive severance fees is often cited reason for making employers reluctant to hire and causing unemployment.

==Examples==

=== European welfare models ===
{{main|European social model}}

==== British Model====
Used by the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and the [[South Asia|South Asian countries]] the British model tends to have a [[welfare state]] of roughly average size, relative to [[High income country|high-income]] [[OECD]] countries, but less comprehensive than those in [[Scandinavia]] and much of continental Europe. They have somewhat more poverty and higher inequality. Despite having a smaller welfare state than most Western European countries, the UK, Ireland and Canada do provide, among other things, universal single payer health care, redistribute income and guarantee an income at subsistence level.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004), ''Economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continental European ====
Used by [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the Continental model has strict rules on job protection and a large amount of regulation in [[industry]]. However, the [[labour market]] has proven to be inflexible and slow to react to [[globalization]]. Generous insurance-based [[unemployment benefits]] and a well funded welfare state are used to reduce poverty and provide high quality health care. This model can generally be seen as middle ground between the British and Nordic models.

==== Mediterranean ====
Used by [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], the [[Mediterranean]] model is similar to the Continental model, but focuses welfare on generous state-pensions. The labour market is inflexible with the same job protectionism as in the Continental model, but is not good at reducing poverty within the [[Working class|lower end]] of society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== The Nordic Model ====
The [[Scandinavian welfare model|Nordic Model]], mainly refers to Nordic countries  [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]] but some include the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Nordic+model&lt;/ref&gt; also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because of strong influence of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] elements such as [[labor union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As a result of the policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in [[Satisfaction with Life Index|world happiness surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360517.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-happiest-places-on-earth-are-heavily-taxed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United States of America ===
{{see also|American way of life}}
Before the Great Depression, the United States adhered to a social model that could be summarized by the term "rugged individualism": the understanding that because most people are capable of taking care of themselves, each person should be left to succeed or fail on their own, only fettered by the bounds of the law, and the government should be limited to protection of [[civil liberties]]. The United States had very little in the way of a [[social safety net]] for its citizens, with most people depending on their families and private social organizations if they were unable to provide for themselves; this partially explains the enduring greater emphasis on family and religion in American society and politics today than in other comparably developed countries in [[Western Europe]].

As a result of increased modernization in the late 19th century, this view changed in the emergence of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], which held that the government can and should have a greater role in regulating the economy, so as to promote a better life for all of its citizens. The biggest change came with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], during which time the American government intervened extensively in the economy, guided often by [[Keynesian economics]]. New programs included relief for the poor, unemployed, and those who cannot work due to youth, old age, or disability.

However, since the [[Great Depression]], the United States has not followed other developed democracies in the establishment of a more comprehensive model for assuring its citizens' well being. One possible explanation for this is that the U.S was not affected in the same way by World War II as Europe was: while Europeans relied on strong centralized governments to help rebuild their economies after two world wars, the United States was enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth due to its being one of the few industrialized countries on the planet whose productive capacity had not been destroyed by enemy nations. But now, with the rise of industrial and geo-political competition in Europe and Asia, growing income inequality, high energy prices, and mounting public debt, there is renewed debate over the role of government in modern society.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural violence''' is a term commonly ascribed to [[Johan Galtung]], which he introduced in the article "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (1969), pp. 167–191&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a form of violence wherein some [[social structure]] or [[social institution]] may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized [[Adultism#Institutional adultism|adultism]], [[ageism]], [[classism]], [[elitism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[nationalism]], [[speciesism]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]] are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.galtung-institut.de/en/home/johan-galtung/ Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html "Seeking Peace from Resolving Conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka" by Prof. Dr. Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an "avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Galtung, "Kulturelle Gewalt" (1993) Vol. 43 ''Der Burger im Staat'' p. 106 in Ho, Kathleen "Structural Violence as a Human Rights Violation" (2007). ''Essex Human Rights Review'' Vol. 4 No. 2 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including [[domestic violence|family violence]], [[sexual violence|gender violence]], [[hate crime]]s, [[racial violence]], [[police violence]], [[state violence]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = James |last1 = Gilligan |authorlink = James Gilligan |year = 1997 |title = Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic |location =  |publisher = [[Vintage Books]] |isbn = 978-0679779124 |quote = Structural violence is ... the main cause of behavioral violence on a socially and epidemiologically significant scale (from homicide and suicide to war and genocide). The question as to which of the two forms of violence—structural or behavioral—is more important, dangerous, or lethal is moot, for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect. |page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic'', [[James Gilligan]] defines structural violence as "the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them". Gilligan largely describes these "excess deaths" as "non-natural" and attributes them to the stress, shame, [[discrimination]], and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the "contest for dignity" in a context of dramatic [[social inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilligan|first1=James|title=Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic|date=1996|publisher=First Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77912-4|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandy X Lee wrote in her article ''Causes and cures VII: Structural violence,'' "It refers to the avoidable limitations society places on groups of people that constrain them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible. These limitations could be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature and usually originate in institutions that have authority over particular subjects."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=109–114|quote=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to say that it "directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause and effects ==
In ''The Sources of Social Power'',&amp;nbsp;Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, "increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Old is Human Brutality?: On the Structural Origins of Violence|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=22|issue=1|last=Malešević|first=Siniša|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=81–104|quote=|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Siniša&amp;nbsp;Malešević&amp;nbsp;elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, "Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gather groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopra|first=Anayika|year=2014|title=Structural Violence|url=|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies|volume=1| issue =  4|pages=19–23|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is about ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural violence==
"Cultural violence" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Cultural Violence," ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1990), pp. 291–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel "right", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the "moral color" of an act from "red/wrong" to "green/right", or at least to "yellow/acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==International scope==
{{see also|Structural violence in Haiti}}
[[Petra Kelly]] wrote in her first book, ''Fighting for Hope'' (1984):

{{quote|A third of the 2 Billion people in the [[developing countries]] are [[starving]] or suffering from [[malnutrition]]. Twenty-five percent of their children die before their fifth birthday […] Less than 10 per cent of the 15 million children who died this year had been [[vaccinated]] against the six most common and dangerous [[Childhood disease|children's diseases]]. Vaccination costs £3 per child. But not doing so costs us five million lives a year. These are classic examples of ''structural violence''.}}

The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, [[medical anthropologist]] [[Paul Farmer]] writes:

{{quote|Their sickness is a result of structural violence: neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault; rather, historically given (and often economically driven) processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency. Structural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress.}}

This perspective has been continually discussed by [[Paul Farmer]], as well as by [[Philippe Bourgois]] and [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]].

Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some,{{who|date=June 2015}} this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]], have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Paul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. 

1. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. 
2. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. 
3. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. &lt;ref&gt;Women, Poverty &amp; AIDS: Sex, Drugs and Structural Violence (Series in Health and Social Justice), with coauthor Margaret Connors, Common Courage Press; Reprint edition (September 1996), {{ISBN|978-1-56751-074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to health care===
Structural violence affects the availability of [[health care]] in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering [[discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|communicable diseases such as HIV]], for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence.&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Farmer |first = Paul E. |authorlink = Paul Farmer |author2 = Nizeye Bruce |author3 = Stulac Sara |author4 = Keshavjee Salmaan |date = October 24, 2006 |title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine |journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] |volume = 3 |issue = 10 |pages = 1686–1691 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030449 |pmid = 17076568 |pmc = 1621099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a [[commodity]], remaining only available to those who can afford them.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;  Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A.|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald E.|last3=Jacobson|first3=C. Jeffrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Undocumented status as a social determinant of occupational safety and health: The workers’ perspective|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%2527_perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|issn=1097-0274|pmc=4632487|pmid=26471878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structural violence is the result of policy and [[social structure]]s, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that "structural interventions" are one possible solution.

Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the [[commodification]] of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's [[economic, social and cultural rights|social and economic rights]], thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

The lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

Structural violence also exists in the area of [[mental health]], where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5443">'''Techno-animism''' is a culture of technological practice where [[technology]] is imbued with human and spiritual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Casper|date=2013|title=Techno-animism in Japan: Shinto Cosmograms, Actor-network Theory, and the Enabling Powers of Non-human Agencies|url=http://www.sagepub.net/tcs/|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that technology, humanity and religion can be integrated into one entity. As an anthropology theory, techno-animism examines the interactions between the material and the spiritual aspects of technology in relation to humans. Techno-animism is often studied in the context of Japan since techno-animism traces most of its roots to the [[Shinto]] religion.

== Background and history ==
[[File:Japan - Miyajima - Mount Misen (2).jpg|thumb|The deity of roads and borders represented in a human form.]]
The practice of instilling human and spiritual characteristics into physical objects has always been part of the Shinto religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862745839|title=A Japanese view of nature : the world of living things|last=1902-1992.|first=Imanishi, Kinji,|last2=1902-1992.|first2=今西, 錦司,|others=Asquith, Pamela J., 1951-|isbn=9781136131141|location=London|oclc=862745839}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deity|Deities]] in the Shinto religion often symbolizes objects of the physical world and their statues often take human forms. With these practices, people form tighter bonds with physical objects. In [[Japanese Culture|Japanese culture]], the interaction between humans and non-human objects is critical to the harmonious coexistence of men and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/704272999|title=Difference and modernity : social theory and contemporary Japanese society|last=R.|first=Clammer, J.|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203841365|location=London|oclc=704272999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example of this type of interaction is that before meals, Japanese people always say "[[itadakimasu]]" which expresses gratitude for the ingredients of the meal may it be animals or plants.

Techno-animism builds upon the practices of the Shinto religion by instilling human and spiritual characteristics into technology. As for representation, techno-animism is often embodied in the engineering design of objects and the way that people interact with those objects. In a larger social context, Techno-animism provides a means for technology to be integrated into the human society because new technology can always be instilled with traditional values.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tsurumi, K. (1992) Animism and Science. Research Papers series A-58, Institute of International Relations, Sophia University, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|thumb|A humanoid robot designed by Honda |193x193px]]
[[File:Charge of the fembots Robot Restaurant, Shinjuku Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Robots "dancing" and "singing" at a show|165x165px]]
The design of certain objects can have human-related traits that illustrate techno-animism. A robot designed by Honda called [[ASIMO]] takes the form of an astronaut wearing a spacesuit. The form factor along with the spiritual values associated with space exploration makes ASIMO an embodiment of techno-animism. In addition, ASIMO can also communicate with humans through language and gestures. Communication is a defining factor of determining whether something is an individual being or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, F. (2004) ‘Who is afraid of the humanoid? Investigating cultural differences in the acceptance of robots’, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics. 1(3): 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the [[robot]] industry offers a wide range of functions from talking robots to [[Sex robot|sex robots]]. Conversation and sexual relationships used to be concepts that only belonged to humans. However, technological advancements and techno-animism are breaking down that barrier with engineering designs that embodies human and spiritual characteristics. 

Beyond the design of objects, the way that people choose to interact with objects could also demonstrate techno-animism. In [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]], there is a restaurant where the waiters are robots instead of humans. Rather than talking to another person, customers only interact with machines throughout the dining process. In this process, customers accept the fact that technology has become part of the human society and has a unique way of interacting with humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social implications ==
Japanese culture and legislation are generally supportive of the techno-animism trend. Considering that Japan's modernization took place in a relatively short period of time in comparison to western nations, techno-animism is seen as a major reason why Japan has been one of the world's centers of technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868914617|title=Themes and theories in modern Japanese history : essays in memory of Richard Storry|others=Henny, Sue, 1947-, Lehmann, Jean-Pierre, 1945-|isbn=9781780939698|location=London|oclc=868914617}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, acceptance of techno-animism is the current attitude in Japan both culturally and legislatively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">'''Technological escalation''' describes the situation where two parties in competition tend to employ continual technological improvements in their attempt to defeat each other.  Technology is defined here as a creative invention, either in the form of an object or a methodology. An example is the mutual escalation seen between [[e-mail spam]]mers and the programmers of spam filters and other anti-spam techniques. Although [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] is usually meant negatively, if two companies are in an escalating competition to produce the best [[Widget (economics)|widget]], the consumer benefits because they get a choice between better and better widgets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23422">'''Technological utopianism''' (often called '''techno-utopianism''' or '''technoutopianism''') is any [[ideology]] based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a [[utopia]], or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A '''techno-utopia''' is therefore an ideal [[society]], in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-[[future]], as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, [[post-scarcity]], [[Trans-human|transformations in human nature]], the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the [[immortality|end of death]].

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as [[technological determinism]] or [[Media imaginary|media imaginaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Balbi|first2=Gabriele|date=2014-04-03|title=Media and the Imaginary in History|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|journal=Media History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–218|doi=10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|issn=1368-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a leading theorist on [[technology]] and [[cyberculture]] claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” &lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. “Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance.” Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance. Web. 02 March 2015. http://www.rushkoff.com/articles-individual/2008/3/31/21st-century-renaissance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause,&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Howard P. Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and The American Future, "The Technological Utopians", Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture, the [[Californian Ideology]], [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title = Rediscovering Utopia | year=  2003 | url = http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx  | accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204653/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2007-09-27 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[singularitarianism]], have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic [[Imre Szeman]] argues technological utopianism is an irrational [[metanarrative|social narrative]] because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which [[Modernity|modern]] societies place faith in [[Idea of Progress|narratives of progress and technology]] overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=People Generally Do Not Act on Information on the Effects of Oil on the Environment |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100528150833.htm |work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

[[Karl Marx]] believed that [[science]] and [[democracy]] were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century [[Classical liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Republicanism|republicans]] often embraced techno-utopianism. [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] like [[Joseph Priestley]] pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in the early 19th century inspired [[Communalism|communalists]] with their visions of a future scientific and [[technological evolution]] of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] to validate the idea of [[social progress]]. [[Edward Bellamy]]’s [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]] in ''[[Looking Backward]]'', which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century [[United States]] and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Socialist]]s, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. [[Marxism|Marxists]] argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with [[Mutualism (economic theory)|different property relations]], but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for [[Empowerment|empowered]] [[proletarian]]s was "to increase the total [[productive forces]] as rapidly as possible". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from [[Social democracy|social democrats]] to [[Communism|communists]], were focused on [[industrialization]], [[economic development]] and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Some technological utopians promoted [[eugenics]]. Holding that in studies of families, such as the [[The Jukes family|Jukes]] and [[Kallikaks]], science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Mark ''Eugenics: Hereditarian attitudes in American thought'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.G. Wells]] in works such as ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' promoted technological utopianism.

The horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The [[Holocaust]], as [[Theodor Adorno]] underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of [[Condorcet]] and other thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which commonly equated [[scientific progress]] with social progress.&lt;ref name="Adorno1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Theodor W.|title=Prisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=29 March 1983|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51025-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From late 20th and early 21st centuries===

{{quotation|The Goliath of totalitarianism will be brought down by the David of the microchip.|[[Ronald Reagan]]|[[The Guardian]], 14 June 1989}}

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[Californian Ideology]] was a set of beliefs combining [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with techno-utopianism and support for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the "bible" of its adherents.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Borsook, Paulina|authorlink = Paulina Borsook|title = Cyberselfishness|year = 1996|url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|accessdate = 2007-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125249/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|archivedate = 2007-09-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author = Borsook, Paulina|title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech| publisher = PublicAffairs|year = 2000|isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy |title = The California Ideology|year = 2000 |url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the [[Internet]] was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. "Self-empowered knowledge workers" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an "obsolete remnant of the [[industrial age]]".&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

Similar forms of "digital utopianism" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or more broadly to [[new media]] as harbingers of political and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Ballatore|first2=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=105–121|doi=10.1177/0163443713511902|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents claim it transcended conventional "[[Left–right politics|right/left]]" distinctions in [[politics]] by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a [[Economic liberalism|hostility toward government regulation]] and a belief in the superiority of the [[free market]] system. Prominent "[[oracles]]" of techno-utopianism included [[George Gilder]] and [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], an editor of ''Wired'' who also published several books.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the [[Dot-com bubble|speculative bubble]] gave rise to claims that an era of "permanent prosperity" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet [[Startup company|startups]] and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent [[Stock market crash|crash]], many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, [[technorealism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] are stances that have risen among advocates of [[technological change]] as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technorealism|url=http://technorealism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/06/technoprogressivism-beyond.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several [[Technical journalism|technical journalists]] and social commentators, such as [[Mark Pesce]], have interpreted the [[WikiLeaks]] phenomenon and the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian [[Freedom of information laws by country|transparent society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42148.html |title=The state, the press and a hyperdemocracy |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mark Pesce |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyber-utopianism]], first coined by [[Evgeny Morozov]], is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]].

==Principles==
Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:&lt;ref name="Gendron 1977"&gt;{{cite book|    author = Gendron, Bernard|     title = Technology and the Human Condition| publisher = St.Martin's Press|      year = 1977|        isbn = 0-312-78890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#We are presently undergoing a ([[post-industrial]]) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, [[technological change|technological growth]] will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the [[post scarcity|end of economic scarcity]];
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major [[social issues|social evil]].

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature''', fostering “communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.''' Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#'''Technology democratizes society.''' The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created “the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#'''Technology inevitably progresses.''' The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV [[remote control]], video game [[joystick]], [[computer mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] allowed for much more progress.
#'''Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive.''' As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its “social side effect… [became] its main feature.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#'''Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice.''' The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#'''New technology can solve the problems created by old technology.''' Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of [[dot.com bubble]] businesses’ attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==

Critics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of [[social progress]] with [[scientific progress]] is a form of [[positivism]] and [[scientism]]. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on "government interference" while dismissing the positive effects of the [[regulation]] of [[business]]. They also point out that it has little to say about the [[Technology#Environmental|environmental impact of technology]]&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see [[global digital divide]]).&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In his 2010 study ''System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster'', [[Canada Research Chair]]holder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the [[environmental issues with petroleum|effects of oil on the environment]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;

In a controversial article "Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality", [[Wall Street Journal]] explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576506393735675856.html#articleTabs%3Darticle|title= Techno-Utopians Are Mugged by Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], ”Technological Dependency and Loss of Freedom”, pp. 245, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

Even today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler &amp; Proctor II|first=Ronald B. &amp; Russell F.|title=Looking Out Looking In|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cenage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-79621-3|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication.  These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues.  The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by [[videotelephony|video]] and [[augmented reality]] versions of digital communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/augmented-reality-in-technical-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teen Age Message''' ('''TAM''') was a series of interstellar radio transmissions sent from the [[Yevpatoria Planetary Radar]] to six [[Solar analog|solar-type stars]] during August–September 2001. The structure of the TAM was suggested by [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]], Chief Scientist at Russia's [[Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grinspoon |first=David |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/who_speaks_for_earth/ |title=Who Speaks for Earth? |publisher=Seedmagazine.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message's content and target stars were selected by a group of teens from four Russian cities, who collaborated in person and via the Internet.&lt;ref name="Zaitsev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/teen-age-message.html |last=Zaitsev |first=Alexander |title=A Teen-Age Message to the Stars |publisher=Cplire.ru |date=2002-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each transmission comprised three sections: a [[automatic sounding|sounding]], a live [[theremin]] concert, and digital data including images and text. TAM was humanity's fourth [[Active SETI]] broadcast and the first musical interstellar radio message.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m62151781m500p16/ |last=Zaitsev |first=A.L. |title=Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics, Volume 53, Number 9 |publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21 |doi=10.1134/S106422690809012X |volume=53 |journal=Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics |pages=1107–1113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Zaitsev's proposal for a musical message – the "First [[Theremin]] Concert for Extraterrestrials" – was submitted to the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in July 2000. It was rejected amid concerns over the dangers posed by advertising the presence of humanity to unknown and possibly highly advanced civilizations. After another unsuccessful attempt to garner support, the project was backed by the [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope]] with funding from the Education Department of Moscow.&lt;ref name="cplire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/Theremin-concert.html |last=Zaitsev |first=Alexander |title=Design and Implementation of the 1st Theremin Concert for Aliens |publisher=Cplire.ru |date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous digital-only messages [[Arecibo message|Arecibo-1974]] and [[Cosmic Call 1]], TAM had a three-part structure, each containing different forms of [[information]]. Such structure was suggested by Alexander Zaitsev, and was intended to make the message easier to detect and interpret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&amp;sr/irm/radio-signals.html RADIO SIGNALS TO EXTRATERRESTRIALS]{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three elements of each transmission were:

# A coherent [[automatic sounding|sounding]] signal with slow [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] wavelength tuning to imitate transmission from the Sun's center. This signal was transmitted in order to help [[extraterrestrials]] detect the TAM and diagnose the radio propagation effect of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name="housenet1"/&gt;
# Analog information recorded on the [[theremin]]. This electric musical instrument produces a quasi-sinusoidal signal which is easily extracted from background noise. There were seven musical compositions in the "First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials".&lt;ref name="Theremin World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereminworld.com/Article/13825/2001-tams-first-theremin-concert-to-space-aliens-featured-ly |title=2001: TAM's First Theremin Concert to Space Aliens Featured Lydia Kavina |publisher=Theremin World |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to communicate with aliens|url=http://www.pravda.ru/science/planet/space/09-06-2009/313582-meti-0/|publisher=pravda.ru|accessdate=31 August 2012|language=Russian|date=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Binary digital information similar to the Arecibo message, including the logotype of TAM, written greetings in Russian and English, and artistic drawings. This section and the concert program were composed by teens from different parts of Russia.&lt;ref name="Zaitsev"/&gt;

==Theremin concert==
[[File:Teen Age Message 7 of 8.jpg|thumb|Anton Kershenko plays the theremin with a student]]
According to Zaitsev, [[art]] must be central to any interstellar message. Physical laws and mathematics are almost certainly already known to extraterrestrial intelligences, but our artwork is unique to us.&lt;ref name="cplire1"/&gt; With this in mind, and in contrast to previous binary digital broadcasts, Zatsev proposed "not a discrete two-tone radiosignal but a more native continuous one, in which smooth frequency variations directly transfer one-dimensional emotional information. I am talking about music, which is more universally comprehensible than language, and about theremin, which is an electronic noncontact musical instrument."&lt;ref name="housenet1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seti.housenet.org/msg_idx_tam.html |title=The TAM (Teen-Age Message) |publisher=seti.housenet.org |accessdate=21 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011027081933/http://www.seti.housenet.org/msg_idx_tam.html |archivedate=27 October 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three theremin performers from the Moscow [[Theremin Center]] – [[Lydia Kavina]], Yana Aksenova, and Anton Kerchenko – were invited to perform seven songs selected by students.&lt;ref name="Theremin World"/&gt; The program included two [[Russian folk songs]] and works by [[Beethoven]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Saint-Saëns]], [[Rakhmaninov]], and [[Gershwin]]. Kavina submitted recordings of her performance, but Aksenova and Kerchenko performed live – the radar dish had been specially modified to accept input from theremins. Each performance lasted about fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name="cplire1"/&gt; The First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials was the world's first musical [[Active SETI]] broadcast, and was sent seven years before NASA's [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] message.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Highfield|first=Roger|title=Nasa to beam Beatles' track across space|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3323919/Nasa-to-beam-Beatles-track-across-space.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 Feb 2008}}

However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%).&lt;ref name=WHO_Childlab/&gt; Approximately 2.4 million [[adolescents]] aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007].

[[Image:Youthfig5-6s3.gif|thumb|Number and distribution of fatal occupational injuries by age among young workers, 1992–2002 BLS 2003]]

==Work that poses special risks for young workers==
[[File:Teen Workers - Real Jobs, Real Risks (Mallory's Story) (2009).webm|thumb|A young worker describing a severe occupational injury]]
Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and [[child labor laws]] prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.

[[Child labor]] is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of [[public education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during [[industrialization]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[worker's rights|workers']] and [[children's rights]]. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in agriculture===
There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrinewspubs.com/Content/Default/Machinery/Article/Keep-kids-safe-on-farm-/-3/102/13392|title=Keep kids safe on farm  - AgriNews|website=www.agrinewspubs.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southwestfarmpress.com/equipment/farm-related-childhood-deaths-are-down-still-too-many|title=Farm-related childhood deaths are down, but still too many|website=southwestfarmpress.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the [[agriculture]] sector.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite journal|last = Windau|first = Janice|author2=Samuel Meyer  |title = Occupational injuries among young workers|journal = Monthly Labor Review|pages = 11–23|date=October 2005|url = http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/10/art2full.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these [[death|fatalities]] could be attributed to [[transportation]] [[accidents]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; According to the "Occupational injuries among young workers" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; There are fewer [[child labor]] restrictions on family-owned or operated [[farm]]s; workers as young as 13 can legally operate [[tractor]]s on farms if their family owns it or operates it.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html|title=Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com|website=CNN|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in construction===
Between the years 1998 and 2002, [[construction]] accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities,&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not [[Legal (disambiguation)|legally]] authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Additionally, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = U.S. Census Bureau|title = Population of the United States by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin, Census 2000 and July 1, 2005| work = National Population Estimates|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| year = 2007|url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762156.html|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in retail trades===
The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the [[retail trade]]s (e.g., [[restaurants]] and retail stores).&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to [[assaults]] and violent acts, most of which were [[homicides]]. Homicide associated with [[robbery]] is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.&lt;ref&gt;Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH [1996a]. Current intelligence bulletin 57: Violence in the workplace; risk factors and prevention strategies. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.&lt;ref&gt;NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current [[child labor laws]] are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], independence, or maturity,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens. Newsletter from the teens at work: injury surveillance and prevention project. Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program.&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.

==U.S. federal and state programs==

===OSHA===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.

=== U.S. Public Health Service ===
The [[U.S. Public Health Service]] has a [[Healthy People 2010|Healthy People 2020]] objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Occupational-Safety-and-Health/objectives#5044|title=Occupational Safety and Health {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) within the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.

The NIOSH funds the [[National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youth.gov/federal-links/national-childrens-center-rural-and-agricultural-health-and-safety|title=National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshfieldresearch.org/nccrahs|title=Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation - National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety|website=www.marshfieldresearch.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal child labor laws===
A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|a}} The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.

===State child labor laws===

States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|b}}
