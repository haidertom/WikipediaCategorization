      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

== Popular music ==

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

'''Afrofuturism''' is a cultural [[aesthetic]], philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African/African Diaspora culture with technology.

==History==
===Mid-late 20th century development===
Despite Afrofuturism being coined in 1993, scholars tend to agree that Afrofuturistic music, art and text became more common and widespread in the late 1950s. The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]]. For many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]]. 

Afrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] ("pure cloned funk"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of "certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies".

Other musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],&lt;ref name=reddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/376/392 |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–90 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcleus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976–1986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotti Golden]] &amp; Richard Scher, electro hip hop producer/writers of [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]", a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, described as a "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1994 essay "Black to the Future", began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art. Dery dubbed this phenomenon "Afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dery|first=Mark|date=1994|title=Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose|url=https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf|journal=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture|location=Durham, NC|publisher=Duke University Press|page=180|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural critic [[Kodwo Eshun]], British journalist [[Mark Sinker]] was theorizing a form of Afrofuturism in the pages of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', a British music magazine, as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1992|title=Black Science Fiction|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-wire/february-1992-(issue-96)-35378/30/2/|journal=The Wire|publisher=Exact Editions Ltd.|page=30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrofuturist ideas have further been expanded by scholars like [[Alondra Nelson]], [[Greg Tate]], [[Tricia Rose]], [[Kodwo Eshun]], and others.&lt;ref name=history-future /&gt; In an interview, Alondra Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people which covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a utopic future. The idea of "alien" or "other" is a theme often explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Alondra Nelson (Interviewee) | title = Afrofuturism |medium = Youtube | year = 2010 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFhEjaal5js}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about a so-called "[[digital divide]]".&lt;ref name="Nelson-Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1527-1951 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–15 | last = Nelson | first = Alondra | title = Introduction: Future Texts | journal = Social Text: Special Issue on Afrofuturism | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | year = 2002 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/v020/20.2nelson01.html | doi=10.1215/01642472-20-2_71-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide overemphasizes the association of racial and economic inequality with limited access to technology.  This association then begins to construct blackness "as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress".&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt; As a critique of the neo-critical argument that the future's history-less identities will end burdensome stigma, Afrofuturism holds that history should remain a part of identity, particularly in terms of race.&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt;

===21st century===

A new generation of recording artists have embraced Afrofuturism into their music and fashion, including [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Beyoncé]]. This tradition continues from artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Janelle Monáe]], who incorporated cyborg themes and metallics into their style.&lt;ref name="La Ferla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Afrofuturism: The Next Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other 21st century musicians who have been characterized as Afrofuturist include singer [[FKA Twigs]],&lt;ref name="La Ferla"/&gt; musical duo [[Ibeyi]],&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; and DJ/producer [[Ras G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism takes flight: from Sun Ra to Janelle Monáe|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=2014-07-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, artists such as Rihanna and Beyoncé have often been interpreted by the public as having some non-human elements about them, exhibited in both their performances, and in their day to day interactions. Because the tabloids have so much control over the way that information is digested, the public receives images of these women that are distant and controlled solely by the media, and thus, these women are often painted as angry or unfeeling. Scholars such as Robin James have interrogated and expanded upon the work of Kodwo Eshun, and coined the idea of the "robo-diva". These scholars both argue that the Black experience has always been more alien than it has been human, and James connects the mechanics of the middle passage to alien abduction through concepts of kidnapping, isolation, and bowing down to an unknown power. Kodwo Eshun also posits that perhaps the categorization of "human" has no use in the Black community, and that instead, the category of "robot" is not only more powerful, but more accurately representative of the positioning in the social hierarchy in which Black people exist in the present day. Because musical artists (Rihanna, Beyoncé) exhibit such non-human qualities, they are often ostracized for being "cold" or "mechanical". The white patriarchy both fears and admires such artists due to their unapologetic displays of female sexuality and its interactions with technology. These fears then propel the virgin/whore dichotomy that stems from the trope of the Jezebel, and serves to further the racialized projections of stereotypes onto Black females in the music industry.

[[Janelle Monáe]] has made a conscious effort to restore Afrofuturist cosmology to the forefront of urban contemporary music. Her notable works include the music videos "Prime Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=janellemonae|title=Janelle Monáe – PrimeTime ft.

This ArchAndroid role reflects earlier Afrofuturistic figures Sun Ra and George Clinton, who created their own visuals as extraterrestrial beings rescuing African-Americans from the oppressive natures of Earth.

Chicago is home to a vibrant community of artists exploring Afrofuturism. [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], known for his Soundsuits project, has helped develop younger talent as the director of the graduate fashion program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other artists include visual artists Hebru Brantley as well as contemporary artist [[Rashid Johnson]], a Chicago native currently based in New York. In 2013, Chicago resident Ytasha L. Womack wrote the study ''Afrofuturism: The World of Black Science Fiction and Fantasy'', and William Hayashi has published all three volumes of his ''Darkside Trilogy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|title=(( The Dark Side Trilogy )) Book One : Discovery – by William Hayashi|website=www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of what happens in America when the country discovers African Americans secretly living on the backside of the moon since before the arrival of Neil Armstrong, an extreme vision of segregation imposed by technologically advanced Blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Xlibris | isbn = 1441586946 | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Discovery: Volume 1 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = XLIBRIS | isbn = 149310005X | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Conception: Volume 2 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} [[Krista Franklin]], a member of University of Chicago's Arts Incubator, is currently exploring the relation between Afrofuturism and the grotesque through her visual and written work with weaves and collected hair.

== Literature ==

The creation of the term Afrofuturism in the 1990s was often primarily used to categorize "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture,"&lt;ref name="Bould"&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon expanded to include artistic, scientific, and spiritual practices throughout the [[African diaspora]]. Contemporary practice retroactively identifies and documents historical instances of Afrofuturist practice and integrates them into the canon. For example, the [[Dark Matter (series)|Dark Matter]] anthologies edited by [[Sheree Thomas]] feature contemporary [[Black science fiction]], discuss Ralph Ellison's [[Invisible Man]] in her introduction, "Looking for the Invisible," and also include older works by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], and [[George S. Schuyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Sheree|authorlink=Sheree Thomas |editor-first=Sheree |editor-last=Thomas |title=Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora |year=2000|publisher=Warner Aspect |isbn=0446525839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Yazsek argues that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel, ''[[Invisible Man]]'', should be thought of as a predecessor to Afrofuturist literature. Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better – or even any –  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for "this kind of future-historical art" to those who succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=297–313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes. [[Nnedi Okorafor]] has been labeled this way, both for her [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Hugo Award]]-winning [[Binti (novel)|Binti]] novella series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384030/nnedi-okorafor-binti-home-afrofuturist-science-fiction-review|title=The Binti novellas are fun, bite-sized stories of interstellar Afrofuturism|date=2017-01-25|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for her novel ''[[Who Fears Death]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-far-out-guide-to-afrofuturism-and-black-magic_us_5711403fe4b0060ccda34a37|title=Your Brief And Far-Out Guide To Afrofuturism|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|date=2016-04-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Barnes]] has been called an Afrofuturist author for his alternate-history novels ''[[Lion's Blood]]'' and ''[[Zulu Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; [[N.

"Loving the Alien." ''The Wire'' 96 (February 1992): 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; this association has been somewhat controversial, since Butler incorporates multi-ethnic and multi-species communities that insist on "hybridity beyond the point of discomfort".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"&gt;Kilgore, De Witt Douglas and Ranu Samantrai. "A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fourth book of the science fiction [[Patternist series]], ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', particularly fits ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth century America.&lt;ref name="Canavan"&gt;Canavan, Gerry.

=== Museum and gallery exhibitions ===

In recent years, there have been many museum exhibitions displaying art with Afrofuturist themes.

The [[Studio Museum in Harlem|Studio Museum]] in Harlem held a major exhibit exploring Afrofuturistic aesthetics from November 14, 2013 to March 9, 2014. The exhibit, called ''The Shadows Took Shape'', displayed more than sixty works of art that looked at recurring themes such as identity in relation to technology, time, and space within African-American communities. Artists featured in the exhibit included Derrick Adams, [[Laylah Ali]] and Khaled Hafez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/the-shadows-took-shape|title=The Shadows Took Shape|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation and treatment of black female bodies is deconstructed by Afrofuturist contemporaries and amplified to alien and gruesome dimensions by artists such as [[Wangechi Mutu]] and Shoshanna Weinberger.

===The grotesque===

In the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a "mutant" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D. Scott|title=AfroSurreal Generation: AFROSURREAL MANIFESTO|url=https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214100010/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alienation===
Afrofuturism takes representations of the lived realities of black people in the past and present, and reexamines the narratives to attempt to build new truths outside of the dominant cultural narrative. By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|year=|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using "extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287–302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, "black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.

This is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their "history" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schrödinger's cat of African American past.

Another example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.

=== Reclamation ===
Ostensibly, Afrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery first coined the term, he says Afrofuturism as "giving rise to a troubling antinomy". This means that the seeming contradiction of a past being snuffed out and the writing of a future sees its possibilities in Afrofuturism. Furthermore, this Afrofuturism kind of story telling is not regulated to one aspect of communication. It is in novels and essays, academic writings and in music, but by its creation, it is ultimately reclaiming some type of autonomy over one's story that has historically been restricted.

Therefore, when Afrofuturism manifests itself in the music of the 80's and beyond, it is under the Afrofuturist's sensibility. It is in this way that, as Mark Dery says, "African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart". Because the ancestors of African Americans were forcibly removed from their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.

== Afrofuturism 2.0 ==
Afrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as "The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement".&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"/&gt; Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broaden to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.

In conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like "magical Negroes" or "references to Sun Ra". Through this identification of "overused tropes" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled "The Mundane Afrofuturist promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.

'''''Art and Documentation''''' ({{lang-pl|Sztuka i Dokumentacja}}) is a scholarly journal on art published in the years 2009-2017 by the Art and Documentation Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.art.pl/ Art and Documentation Association]&lt;/ref&gt; in Lodz (Poland). Since 2018 the journal is published by Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk. It appears twice a year. Scholarly articles are peer-reviewed. All content is published under the Creative Commons licenses. The journal is a platform aiming at shaping views, posing questions and initiating research. It gathers scholars, artists, art critics and curators. ''Art and Documentation'' focuses on works of an ephemeral nature, i.e. conceptual or post-conceptual works and related issues and documentation and documenting of [[contemporary art]] as well as creating art based on documentation. It also publishes [[primary source]]s - gallery timelines, manifestos, artists' statements etc. The journal's aim is to include research on art within the broader field of performance studies, strengthen the relationship between academic research on art and contemporary art practices, and combine theory and practice in a more direct way. This is reflected in the topics presented in the journal and the extended scope of research and methodologies that are becoming more diverse and interdisciplinary.

The '''Birmingham Group''', sometimes called the '''Birmingham School''',{{sfn|Crawford|1984|p=28}} was an informal collective of [[painters]] and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] associated with the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], that worked in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. All of its members studied or taught at the [[Birmingham School of Art]] after the reorganisation of its teaching methods by [[Edward R. Taylor]] in the 1880s, and it was the School that formed the group's primary focus.{{sfn|Crawford|1984|pp=28-30}} Members of the group also overlapped with other more formal organisations, including the [[Birmingham Guild of Handicraft]], the [[Ruskin Pottery]] and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts]].{{sfn|Crawford|1984|pp=30-32}}

The Group formed one of the last outposts of late [[Romanticism]] in the visual arts, and an important link between the last of the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] and the new Slade [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]].

==History==
[[File:BirminghamBIADFineArtMargaretStreet.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Birmingham School of Art]]]]
They began to form in an informal manner in the 1890s. Many were later to become teachers in Birmingham (especially the great [[Birmingham Municipal School of Art]] under [[Edward R. Taylor]]), and this meant that the [[Edward Burne-Jones]] style influenced all those who studied at the Birmingham art schools.  Many were also heavily influenced by the ideas and practices of [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]], and had indeed personally known those men.  Several had undertaken work for the [[Kelmscott Press]], with [[Charles March Gere]] producing the famous frontispiece to ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. Many, unable to support themselves only through their art, also became fine crafts makers as well as teachers.

There was initially no formal membership, but during the 1930s they were known to have had a membership secretary.

Some of their members later became part of the [[Birmingham Surrealists]] group of artists, thus carrying to English Surrealism the rich vein of Romantic concern with emotional states in pictures, with myth and fantasy, with visions, and with a "natural supernaturalist" experience conveyed through art. The Birmingham Surrealists had made contact with the London Surrealist Group around 1940 and ex Birmingham Group members such as Emmy Bridgwater exhibited at the International Surrealist show in Paris in 1947. (See: Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, ''Surrealism in Birmingham: 1935–1954'' (2001).

The Fine Art Society held an extensive exhibition of Birmingham Group works in 1969. The galleries of the Birmingham Group's works formed a keystone of the major ''The Last Romantics'' exhibition at the Barbican in 1989.

'''Cirebon Mask Dance''' or ''tari topeng Cirebon'' is a local indigenous art form of [[Cirebon]] in Java, including [[Indramayu]] and [[Jatibarang, Indramayu|Jatibarang]], [[West Java]] and [[Brebes]], [[Central Java]]. It is called mask dance because the dancers use masks when dancing. There is a lot of variety in Javanese mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. Sometimes the mask dance can be performed by solo dancers, or it can also be performed by several people.

Graceful hand and body movements, and musical accompaniment dominated by drums and fiddle, are hallmarks of  Javanese mask dance.
The dance is performed on special occasions for local officials, or for other traditional celebrations.

The one of mask dance maestro is [[Mimi Rasinah]], an active dancer and teaches studio art at the ''Tari Topeng Mimi Rasinah'' located in the village Pekandangan, Indramayu . Since 2006, Mimi Rasinah suffering from paralysis, but she was still excited to performing, dancing and teaching mask dance until the end of her life, Mimi Rasinah died in August 2010 at the age of 80.

Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder.

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture.

Their usage can be seen in cultural expressions, [[phraseologism]]s, [[jokes]], [[slogan]]s, [[literature]], [[religion]], [[folklore]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], etc.&lt;ref name="elies"&gt;[http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD11/LD11-05-Lucia.pdf Luque Nadal, L. (2009): "Los culturemas: ¿unidades lingüísticas, ideológicas o culturales?" en Language Design 11, págs. 93-120] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which are subcultures in a culture system. Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in [[translation studies]] and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.&lt;ref name="elies" /&gt;

== Phases of a Cultureme ==

Fernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654436579|title=The Mutual interaction of people and their built environment : a cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|others=Rapoport, Amos., International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (9th : 1973 : Chicago)|year=|isbn=9789027979094|location=The Hague|pages=265–274|oclc=654436579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase One: Basic Culturemes ===

'''Basic culturemes''' are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural "realms," '''urban''' and '''rural''', and two domains: exterior and interior.  Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions.  Within either cultures, there are '''exteriors''' (what is observed from the outside) and '''interiors''' (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective).  The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural-interior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance,

&lt;blockquote href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;"in ''North America'' (United States and Canada): the larger size of many automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=11|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Phase Two: Primary Culturemes ===
'''Primary culturemes''' exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into '''environmental''' (cultural settings) and '''behavioral''' (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and "experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=12|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase Three: Secondary Culturemes ===
Culturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc.  These are '''secondary culturemes'''. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phase Four: Tertiary Culturemes ===
Phase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible.  The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Translation ==
Translating a cultureme can be challenging, as [[connotation]]s are sometimes very strong. For instance: the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''alcázar'' means "the castle", "palace" or "fortress", but, as it is of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, it recalls eight centuries of history ([[Al Andalus]]), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word "fortress" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the [[loan word]] [[Alcázar|alcazar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum24/secciones/tritonos-3-culturemas.htm Translation of culturemes for tourism] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaskot|first=Maciej Paweł|last2=Ganoshenko|first2=Iurii|date=2015-12-31|title=Culturemes and Non-Equivalent Lexis in Dictionaries|url=https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/cs-ec/article/view/cs.2015.009|journal=Cognitive Studies {{!}} Études cognitives|language=|volume=|issue=15|pages=115–124|doi=10.11649/cs.2015.009|issn=2392-2397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturemes are translated in several ways:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;Literal translation: Language of the cultureme is rendered in another language in attempts to convey the same core meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional equivalence: Translating meaning without the inclusion of its cultural association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Near-synonymy: A translation has a similar meaning to the cultureme without being identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under-specification: A space-saving technique that give a short and manageable definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion: A translation that does not preserve the same meaning as the cultureme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explanation: A translator uses this technique in their efforts to get the audience to fully understand the meaning. This can involve lengthy and overly detailed descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Category change: In the instance that the cultureme is obsolete or no longer relevant, a modern-day equivalent is provided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glossary: A given text provides a definition at the end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="International Standard Book Number"&gt;Over-specification: More information is given than required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No translation: Some culturemes are kept in their original language. This applies mainly to [[Latin script|Roman script]] languages, though other languages may have their culturemes [[Romanization|romanized]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omission: The translator may omit what they judge to be peripheral in what is meant to be said.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolae|first=Adina Oana|date=2015|title=Multicultural dialogue: translating culturemes|url=|journal=Discourse as a Form of Multiculturalism in Literature and Communication|language=|volume=3|pages=215–222|doi=|isbn=978-606-8624-21-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Culture: Norms, Ideas, and Materials ===

In translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its "cultureme" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=603–621|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Norms''' refer to the habits and traditions of a societal group. A culture with a foundation of politeness that uses [[honorific]] terms of address, such as in the [[Korean language|Korean]] language, has very intricate forms of pronouns that have nonequivalence in other languages, e.g. English. Different cultures and languages have different interpretations of politeness that affects how successful a cultureme is translated. Traditional holidays are norms in a culture. The Vietnamese New Year ''[[Tết]]'' is a cultureme of the Vietnamese language and culture. ''Tết'' signifies the start of the new year on the [[Lunar calendar]]. It is a day of being home with family and cheerful celebration. A literal translation of ''Tết'' to English would be "New Year." But, anyone who had no knowledge of the cultureme would think the traditions and practices of "New Year's" all the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;*'''Ideas''' refer to "scientific truths, religious beliefs, myths, legends, works of literature, superstitions, aphorisms, proverbs, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=614|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These culturemes are deep rooted in shared, personal history that outsiders of a culture are unfamiliar with knowing. Culturemes pertaining to cultural ideas do not need explained in the present, their meanings and significance are cemented in the people's knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Materials''' refer to physical culture. Food, for instance, is a important example of tangible culture; it can illustrate dietary culture/lifestyle. Certain dishes are staples of the culture and can be a product of the local surroundings. The existence of a food or dish may have historical relevance to a culture. Translation in recipes that involve food cultureme can result in the wrong ingredients being introduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Cutup''' is a group of London-based artists, whose work mainly revolves around the manipulation of [[billboard]] [[advertisements]]. Their first works consisted of removing a billboard, painstakingly cutting it up into roughly 4000 small rectangles, each one in essence a [[pixel]], and then reassembling the billboard.

More recently, Cutup have started other projects, such as replacing small bus-shelter advertisements with a drilled sheet of wood. The illuminating back lights that turn on at dusk reveal an image, as the many holes light up against the dark background.

Although they mainly deal with art on the street, the group have also created installations, including setting 96 different alarm clocks one a minute apart and sound installations, made up of 94 speakers, mini disks and circuit boards.

==Shows and exhibitions==
Cutup have held shows in London, New York and Barcelona, including two shows at London's [[Seventeen Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.17space.com/index.php?p=3&amp;id=3 Seventeen Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; including a recent show which exhibited a full size billboard and a bus shelter, brought inside especially for the show, as well as related video and film pieces.

Other shows have included "La Vida Te Espera" at [[NIU Gallery]], Barcelona in June 2006, "Satellites", at [[Tanya Bonakdar Gallery]], New York and a show at the Kemistry Gallery in Shoreditch.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Deconstructivism''' is a movement of [[postmodern architecture]] which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building.  It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}   Its name comes from the idea of "[[Deconstruction]]", a form of [[semiotic]] analysis developed by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].  Architects whose work is often described as deconstructionism (though in many cases the architects themselves reject the label)  include [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}    

Besides fragmentation,  Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-[[Rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes which appear to distort and dislocate [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]]. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

==History, context and influences==

Deconstructivism came to public notice with the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]], in particular the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and the winning entry by [[Bernard Tschumi]], as well as the [[Museum of Modern Art]]’s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]]. Tschumi stated that calling the work of these architects a "movement" or a new "style" was out of context and showed a lack of understanding of their ideas, and believed that Deconstructivism was simply a move against the practice of [[Postmodernism]], which he said involved "making doric temple forms out of plywood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tschumi.com/news/33/ Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi in Conversation, 18 May 2001, ETH Zürich.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential exhibitions include the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term has stuck and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

===Modernism and postmodernism===
[[File:Seattle Central Library, Seattle, Washington - 20060418.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Seattle Central Library]] by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]

The term "Deconstructivism" in [[contemporary architecture]] is opposed to the ordered rationality of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]]. Though postmodernist and nascent deconstructivist architects both published in the journal ''[[Oppositions]]'' (between 1943 and 1954), that journal's contents mark a decisive break between the two movements. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance to [[architectural history]], wanting to "disassemble" architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, ''Architecture and Disjunction''&lt;/ref&gt; While postmodernism returned to embrace the historical references that modernism had shunned, possibly ironically, deconstructivism rejected the postmodern acceptance of such references, as well as the idea of ornament as an after-thought or decoration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In addition to ''Oppositions'', a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was [[Robert Venturi]]'s ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], the two main branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as "the decorated shed." Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This is close to the thesis of Venturi's next major work,&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, ''Learning From Las Vegas''&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of [[Semiotics|semiology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is quite different. The basic building was the subject of problematics and intricacies in deconstructivism, with no detachment for ornament. Rather than separating ornament and function, like postmodernists such as Venturi, the functional aspects of buildings were called into question. Geometry was to deconstructivists what ornament was to postmodernists, the subject of complication, and this complication of geometry was in turn, applied to the functional, structural, and spatial aspects of deconstructivist buildings. One example of deconstructivist complexity is [[Frank Gehry]]'s [[Vitra Design Museum]] in Weil-am-Rhein, which takes the typical unadorned white cube of modernist [[art gallery|art galleries]] and deconstructs it, using geometries reminiscent of cubism and abstract expressionism. This subverts the functional aspects of modernist simplicity while taking modernism, particularly the international style, of which its white stucco skin is reminiscent, as a starting point. Another example of the deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is [[Peter Eisenman]]'s [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. The Wexner Center takes the archetypal form of the [[castle]], which it then imbues with complexity in a series of cuts and fragmentations. A three-dimensional grid, runs somewhat arbitrarily through the building. The grid, as a reference to modernism, of which it is an accoutrement, collides with the medieval antiquity of a castle. Some of the grid's columns intentionally don't reach the ground, hovering over stairways creating a sense of neurotic unease and contradicting the structural purpose of the [[column]]. The Wexner Center deconstructs the archetype of the castle and renders its spaces and structure with conflict and difference.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Deconstructivist philosophy===
[[File:ImperialWarMuseumNorth01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind]]'s [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] (2002). An archetype of deconstructivist architecture, it comprises three fragmented, intersecting curved volumes, symbolizing the destruction of war.]]

Some Deconstructivist architects were influenced by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Eisenman was a friend of Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the [[modernism]]/[[postmodernism]] interplay, [[Expressionist architecture|expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[minimalism]] and [[contemporary art]]. Deconstructivism attempts to move away from the supposedly constricting 'rules' of modernism such as "[[form follows function]]," "[[purism (arts)|purity of form]]," and "[[truth to materials]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The main channel from deconstructivist philosophy to [[architectural theory]] was through the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s influence with [[Peter Eisenman]]. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement [[Deconstruction]], and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the [[Parc de la Villette]] competition, documented in ''Chora l Works''. Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Libeskind, Daniel. [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/imperial-war-museum-north/ "Imperial War Museum North Earth Time"] quote ''"This project develops the realm of the in between, the inter-est.... Pointing to that which is absent"''. Retrieved April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; were concerned with the "[[metaphysics of presence]]," and this is the main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year=2006|type=Paperback|edition=Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic of presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman and Derrida, ''Choral Works''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Derrida, readings of texts are best carried out when working with classical narrative structures. Any architectural deconstructivism requires the existence of a particular archetypal ''con''struction, a strongly-established conventional expectation to play flexibly against.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology''&lt;/ref&gt; The design of [[Frank Gehry]]’s own [[Santa Monica]] residence, (from 1978), has been cited as a prototypical deconstructivist building. His starting point was a prototypical suburban house embodied with a typical set of intended social meanings. Gehry altered its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other expectations in a playful subversion, an act of "de"construction"&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Robert (1994).[http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 "Mattaclarking"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013252/http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 |date=2007-05-17 }} Dissertation Exploring the work of Gordon Matta-Clark. Retrieved April, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Derrida's concepts of the metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and erasure, embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; found their way into deconstructivist [[memorial]]s. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of [[concrete poetry]]. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and erasure were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]. The museum is conceived as a trace of the erasure of the [[Holocaust]], intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as [[Maya Lin]]'s [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] and Peter Eisenman's [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] are also said to reflect themes of trace and erasure.

===Constructivism and Russian Futurism===
Another major current in deconstructivist architecture takes inspiration from the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] and [[Russian futurism|Futurist]] movements of the early twentieth century, both in their graphics and in their visionary architecture, little of which was actually constructed.

Artists [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], and [[Alexander Rodchenko]], have influenced the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward [[purism (arts)|purism]], though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[collectivism|collectivist]] causes.

The primary graphic motifs of constructivism were the rectangular bar and the triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series ''Prouns'', El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often [[Technical drawing|drafted]] and share aspects with [[technical drawing]] and [[engineering drawing]]. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series ''Micromegas'' by Daniel Libeskind.

{{Quotation|The symbolic breakdown of the wall effected by introducing the Constructivist motifs of tilted and crossed bars sets up a subversion of the walls that define the bar itself. ... This apparent chaos actually constructs the walls that define the bar; it is the structure. The internal disorder produces the bar while splitting it even as gashes open up along its length.|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley|Deconstructive Architecture|p. 34}}

===Contemporary art===
Two strains of modern art, [[minimalism]] and [[cubism]], have had an influence on deconstructivism. [[Analytical cubism]] had a sure effect on deconstructivism, as forms and content are dissected and viewed from different perspectives simultaneously. A synchronicity of disjoined space is evident in many of the works of [[Frank Gehry]] and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. [[Synthetic cubism]], with its application of [[found object]] art, is not as great an influence on deconstructivism as [[Analytical cubism]], but is still found in the earlier and more vernacular works of Frank Gehry. Deconstructivism also shares with minimalism a disconnection from cultural references. &lt;!---It also often shares with minimalism, notions of [[conceptual art]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} ---&gt;

With its tendency toward deformation and dislocation, there is also an aspect of [[expressionism]] and [[expressionist architecture]] associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, [[neo-expressionism]], and [[abstract expressionism]] as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of [[Franz Kline]], in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]. The work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work,&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, "Point and Line to Plane"&lt;/ref&gt; is in the same spirit as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.

Several artists in the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that influenced or took part in deconstructivism. [[Maya Lin]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where [[contemporary art]] is confluent with architecture. ''Ghost'' (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. [[Gordon Matta-Clark]]'s ''Building cuts'' were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.

===1988 MoMA exhibition===
[[Mark Wigley]] and [[Philip Johnson]] curated the 1988 [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist architecture'', which crystallized the movement, and brought fame and notoriety to its key practitioners. The architects presented at the exhibition were [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Mark Wigley wrote the accompanying essay and tried to show a common thread among the various architects whose work was usually more noted for their differences.

{{Quotation|The projects in this exhibition mark a different sensibility, one in which the dream of pure form has been disturbed.

It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.

The show examines an episode, a point of intersection between several architects where each constructs an unsettling building by exploiting the hidden potential of modernism.
|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley, excerpt from the MoMA ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' catalog}}

===Computer-aided design===
[[Computer aided design]] is now an essential tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes the use of computers especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - [[Computer-aided manufacturing]]) allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived with the aid of a computer, but were not; [[Zaha Hadid]]'s sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process. Though the computer has made the designing of complex shapes much easier, not everything that looks odd is "deconstructivist."

==Critical responses==
Since the publication of [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History'' (first edition 1980) there has been a keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in [[critical theory]] as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, [[critical regionalism]]. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the [[Wexner Center]]. [[Critical Theory]], however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.

The difference between criticality in deconstructivism and criticality in critical regionalism, is that critical regionalism ''reduces'' the overall level of complexity involved and maintains a clearer analysis while attempting to reconcile modernist architecture with local differences. In effect, this leads to a modernist "vernacular." Critical regionalism displays a lack of self-criticism and a [[utopia]]nism of place. Deconstructivism, meanwhile, maintains a level of self-criticism, as well as external criticism and tends towards maintaining a level of complexity. Some architects identified with the movement, notably [[Frank Gehry]], have actively rejected the classification of their work as deconstructivist.&lt;ref&gt;Said Frank Gehry of Eisenman's [[Aronoff Center]], "The best thing about Peter's buildings is the insane spaces he ends up with.... All that other stuff, the philosophy and all, is just bullshit as far as I'm concerned." Quoted in Peter Eisenman, ''Peter Eisenman: 1990-1997'', ed. Richard C. Levene and Fernando Márquez Cecilia (Madrid: El Croquis Editorial, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of deconstructivism see it as a purely formal exercise with little social significance. [[Kenneth Frampton]] finds it "elitist and detached".&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 3rd edition, 1992, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Salingaros]] calls deconstructivism a "viral expression" that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, Nikos. "Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction", Umbau-Verlag, 3rd edition, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms are similar to those of deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Judhajit; Deconstruction: From Philosophy to Design].

"Today, in the mid 90s the term 'deconstructivism' is used casually to label any work that favours complexity over simplicity and dramatises the formal possibilities of digital production."&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt;

'''Downtown''' is the central business district for [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]]. Located in the heart of the city, Downtown Bakersfield is easily accessible from all its other parts. It is also reemerging as the center of Bakersfield’s arts, culture and entertainment sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/growth/x1029066010/A-new-energy-brewing-downtown 'A new energy' brewing downtown]. The Bakersfield Californian.  February 18, 2010.  Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown contains several of the cities major theaters, sporting complexes, museums, and historical landmarks.

What is considered to be “downtown” Bakersfield varies. In order to define Downtown Bakersfield, it is important to first define the Central Bakersfield region. Starting from the north and traveling clockwise, Central Bakersfield is bounded by the Kern River, Union Avenue, [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]], and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]]. Most people (including the Downtown Business Association) define downtown Bakersfield as the region bordered by 24th Street (SR 178), Union Avenue (SR 204), California Avenue, and "F" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf Downtown Dining] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121407/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/dtba/CathyFlyerMapNEWtrolley.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}. Downtown Bakersfield Business Association. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other people extend the boundaries east to State Route 99 and north to Golden State Avenue (SR 204). Some people consider all of Central Bakersfield to be “downtown Bakersfield.”

Unlike most cities of similar size, Bakersfield does not have a towering skyline. There are few tall buildings in Downtown Bakersfield, such as the Bank of America Building (10 stories), the Bakersfield Marriott Hotel (9 stories), and The Padre Hotel (8 stories). The shops and cafes that line the Downtown streets feature a variety of dining and shopping opportunities. Visitors to Downtown Bakersfield can find souvenirs, antiques, local art work, and even natural baby products. Notable attractions in Downtown Bakersfield include the Rabobank Arena, the McMurtrey Aquatic Center, the Bakersfield Museum of Art, the historic Fox Theater, the exquisitely renovated The Padre Hotel, and a nightlife district centered on 19th Street and Wall Street Alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|title=About Downtown Bakersfield|work=numerous sources|accessdate=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727185106/http://www.bakersfieldcarealestate.biz/Small_Town_Feel_In_A_Big_City.asp|archivedate=2013-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts==
Bakersfield has always had some districts located downtown. Recently, as part of a redevelopment effort, others are being created.

===Arts District===
{{main|Arts District, Bakersfield}}

[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-ThePadre.jpg|thumb|right|The Padre Hotel building, renovated and reopened in 2010, has been a longtime landmark in Downtown Bakersfield.]]
'''The Arts District''' is one of the newer districts to be defined in Downtown Bakersfield. It is roughly bordered by 21st Street, Chester Avenue, 17th Street, and "G" Street. Theaters in the district include the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield)|Fox Theater]] (20th St. and H St), Stars Theater (Chester Ave. and 20th St) and Spotlight Theater (19th St. and H St). In addition, several art galleries are located around the intersection of 19th Street and Eye Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf Arts and Culture District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121521/http://wwwstatic.kern.org/gems/artscouncil/ArtsCultureMap.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}. The Arts Council of Kern. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts District is also home to the historic The [[Padre Hotel]], which has been remodeled and reopened as a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepadrehotel.com/ Home Page]. The Padre Hotel. Accessed: 05-06-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The district has also begun holding [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] which showcases galleries and allows for street vendors on the first Friday of every month in support of local artists.

===Civic Center===
{{main|Civic Center, Bakersfield}}
'''Civic Center''' is the center of government for both the [[Bakersfield, California|City of Bakersfield]] and the [[Kern County, California|County of Kern]]. It is roughly bordered by Truxtun Ave, Q St, BNSF railroad yard, and H St. Major government buildings include [[Bakersfield City Hall]], County of Kern Administrative Building, [[Kern County Hall of Records|hall of records]], Superior Court, and Municipal Court.

Although structures representing the center of government, such as City Hall and the Court House are located there, growth has resulted in many services being moved to other places throughout the city. Also, many state and federal services are also placed in locations outside of the Civic Center.

Civic Center has also become one of Bakersfield’s sport centers. Civic Center also houses the [[Rabobank Theater and Convention Center]] (formerly known as the Civic Auditorium). This is the largest theater and convention facility in the city. It is also conveniently located next to the Marriott Convention Hotel. The [[Rabobank Arena]] (formerly known as the Centennial Garden), is a large indoor multipurpose arena.&lt;ref&gt;Alten, Jennifer. [http://www.sportsdestinations.com/ID-66-articledetails.aspx The Sun Shines on Bakersfield's Sporting Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728152816/http://www.sportsdestinations.com/ID-66-articledetails.aspx |date=July 28, 2009 }}. Sports Destination Management. July/August 2009. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McMurtrey Aquatic Center]] houses a 50-meter competition swimming and diving pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldswim.us/pools.html City Pools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191735/http://www.bakersfieldswim.us/pools.html |date=May 27, 2010 }}. City of Bakersfield Recreation &amp; Parks. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Bakersfield Ice Sports Center]], an indoor ice rink used for junior and adult league hockey and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldicesports.com/ice_hockey.html Hockey League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511002616/http://www.bakersfieldicesports.com/ice_hockey.html |date=May 11, 2010 }}. Bakersfield Ice Sports. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education District===
{{main|Education District, Bakersfield}}
'''Education District''' is the center of education institutions that are located Downtown. Currently five institutions have a campus or a satellite campus in the district. The Education District is roughly bordered by 24th St, Q St, 20th St and Chester Ave.

===Mill Creek===
{{main|Mill Creek, Bakersfield}}
'''Mill Creek''' is another one of Downtown’s newer districts, and is still being developed. When fully completed, Mill Creek will consist of a mixture of both low and high density residential, commercial and retail. The redevelopment area is defined to be Golden State Avenue, Union Avenue, California Avenue, and "Q" Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakersfieldcity.us/cityhighlights/state_of_city_2008/2008_powerpoint_presentations/dkunz-millcreek.pdf Mill Creek, A Downtown Master Plan]. City of Bakersfield. Page 2. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the center of Mill Creek is the [[Mill Creek (Bakersfield)|Mill Creek Linear Park]]. This runs along the manmade Kern Island Canal, which has been redesigned to have the look of a natural river.

A major attraction in the area is the [[Bakersfield Museum of Art]]. The [[Beale Memorial Library]], which is the headquarters for the Kern County Library System, is also located in the Mill Creek. Another important structure is the [[Bakersfield (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]], which is Bakersfield’s rail link to the [[San Joaquin Valley]].

==Other Neighborhoods and Districts==
The following are neighborhoods and districts which are near to Downtown Bakersfield. Some people consider them to be a part of Downtown.

===Buck Owens Boulevard===
[[File:Bakersfield CA - sign.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bakersfield Sign]].]]
Formerly named Pierce Road, Buck Owens Boulevard was renamed in 1998 in honor of long-time Bakersfield resident and [[country music]] legend [[Buck Owens]], who died in 2006.&lt;ref name="About Buck Owens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|title=About Buck Owens|work=Buck Owen's Crystal Palace|accessdate=4 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707215828/http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck.html|archivedate=7 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buck Owens Boulevard runs north/south, parallel to Highway 99, between Rosedale Highway/24th Street in Bakersfield, and Airport Drive in [[Oildale, California|Oildale]]. Buck Owens Boulevard is located near [[Beach Park (Bakersfield)|Beach Park]] and is the heart of Bakersfield's Country Music scene.&lt;ref name="About Buck Owens"/&gt; The main attractions in the area are the original [[Bakersfield Sign]] (formerly located at intersection of California and Union Ave.) and the [[Buck Owens Crystal Palace]] a unique museum, store, concert hall, and restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buck Owens' Crystal Palace |url=http://www.buckowens.com/index2.html |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023011142/http://www.buckowens.com/index2.html |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westchester===
The '''Westchester''' neighborhood is just west of Downtown Bakersfield, although some people consider it to be part of Downtown. Westchester is bounded by the [[Kern River]], "F" Street, BNSF Railroad Yard and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] (or Oak Street).&lt;ref&gt;Waldner, Erin [http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/local/x726008486/Living-in-Westchester Living in Westchester]. The Bakersfield Californian. September 26, 2006. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Westchester is a mostly residential neighborhood. The neighborhood is known for large shady trees and historic homes built between the 1900s and 1960s. Main points of interest include the [[Kern County Museum]] (with the [[Beale Memorial Clock Tower]]), and [[Sam Lynn Ballpark]].

=== Oleander-Sunset ===

The '''Oleander-Sunset''' [[Suburb]]s  is located in [[List_of_neighborhoods_in_Bakersfield#Central_Bakersfield_.28Downtown.29|central Bakersfield]] and sits on the southern end of downtown Bakersfield.

Bakersfield Black p.1] Bakersfieldblack.com Retrieved 16-02-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on who a person talks to, the Oleander-Sunset suburbs may refer to the Oleander area only. The Oleander neighborhood is original bounded by:  California Avenue, H Street, Freeway 58, and Oak Street. Traditionally, the Lowell neighborhood Community is bounded by California Avenue, Union Avenue, State Route 58, and H Street.

==Transportation==
{{further|Transportation in Kern County}}
[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-GarcesCircle.jpg|thumb|right|Garces Circle.]]
Being located in the heart of Bakersfield, getting to and from Downtown is relatively easy. [[California State Route 178|State route 178 freeway]] ends at the eastern edge, and provides connection to the northeast. [[California State Route 99|State route 99]] is approximately 1/2 miles west, and provides north/south connection to the rest of the city. Golden State Ave ([[California State Route 204|state route 204]]), as a freeway ends at the north edge of downtown, and provides access to the northwest.

Downtown also is the primary hub for all modes of intracity and intercity transportation, except air travel. [[Golden Empire Transit]] (GET) provides transportation to Greater Bakersfield from the downtown transit center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getbus.org/maps Maps]. Golden Empire Transit. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kern Regional Transit]] provides intercity transportation from GET downtown transit center or Amtrak station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.kern.ca.us/roads/kernregionaltransit.asp Kern Regional Transit Schedule]. Kern County Roads. Accessed: 05-07-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amtrak]] provides rail connection to the San Joaquin Valley north of Bakersfield, and several bus routes to points west, south and east of the city (with tickets that travel by train at least once).&lt;ref&gt;''San Joaquin Timetable''. Amtrak. Effective date: October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traveling to downtown is relatively easy by car, traveling through it is more difficult. Since SR 178 freeway and Golden State Avenue (SR 204 freeway) stop at the edge of Downtown, cars must travel on surface streets to connect to additional freeways. This has created heavy traffic on major connecting arterial roads, especially on 23rd Street and 24th Street, which are one-way in each direction. This is especially a problem for cars traveling from the northeast to the southwest, since 23rd/24th St. is the most direct route between those two points.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10368">'''''Droit de suite''''' ([[French language|French]] for "right to follow") is a right granted to [[artist]]s or their heirs, in some jurisdictions, to receive a fee on the resale of their works of art. This should be contrasted with policies such as the American [[first-sale doctrine]], where artists do not have the right to control or profit from subsequent sales.

Óleo sobre lienzo, 55.5 x 66 cm).jpg|thumb|''[[The Angelus (painting)|The Angelus]]'' was sold by Millet for 1,000 francs in 1865, but just 14 years after [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s death in 1889 it was sold by the copper merchant [[Eugène Secrétan|Secrétan]] for 553,000 francs]]

The ''droit de suite'' was first proposed in Europe around 1893, in response to a decrease in the importance of the salon, the end of the private patron, and to champion the cause of the “starving artist.”{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Many artists, and their families, had suffered from the war, and ''droit de suite'' was a means to remedy socially difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060175.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], ''droit de suite'' was created in France following the sale of [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s 1858 painting, the ''[[The Angelus (painting)|Angélus]]'', in 1889 at the [[Secretan sale]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The owner of the painting made a huge profit from this sale, whereas the family of the artist lived in poverty.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The [[Resale Rights Directive|2001/84/EC]] [[European Union directive|directive]] mandates a somewhat uniform system of ''droit de suite'' across the [[European Union]]. This directive is controversial in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/01/11/droit-de-suite-debate-heats-up/|title=‘Droit de Suite’ Debate Heats Up|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=11 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], this system is in force through article L122-8 of the Code of intellectual property. It will be reformed by article 48 of the [[DADVSI]] law, which implements directive 2001/84/EC.  During discussions in the French Parliament leading to this law, it was argued that in practice, the ''droit de suite'' is only paid at [[auction]]s, and that it thus disfavors the Paris art marketplace compared to [[London]] or [[New York City]]. Following DADVSI, a government regulation (through a [[decree]]) is to set degressive rates and maximal fees so that the Paris marketplace is not hindered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/amendements/1206/120600232.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[California Resale Royalty Act]], (Civil Code section 986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|website=law.onecle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was struck down as unconstitutional on May 17, 2012 because it violated the US Constitution Interstate Commerce clause, ending a 35-year run that entitled [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances. The ruling by Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of U.S. District Court Judge, Central District of California, is pending appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Nguyen added:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2012/05/court_calls_california_resale.html|title = BLOG: Federal Court Finds California Resale Royalties Act Unconstitutional|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The Court finds that the CRRA explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art ''occurring wholly outside California'' [emphasis added]. Under its clear terms, the CRRA regulates transactions occurring anywhere in the United States, so long as the seller resides in California. Even the artist---the intended beneficiary of the CRRA---does not have to be a citizen of, or reside in, California....Therefore, the CRRA violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

California’s droit de suite statute, the California Resale Royalty Act, was enacted in 1976,&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1663016|title=The California Resale Royalty Act: Droit De [Not So] Suite|first=Emily|last=Barker|date=10 December 2009|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was struck down on May 17, 2012, pending appeal.  The law applied to all works of fine art resold in California, or resold anywhere by a California resident, for a gross sale of $1000 or more.  It had mandated a five percent royalty on the resale price of any work of fine art.  An artist was able to waive this right “by a contract in writing providing for an amount in excess of five percent of the amount of such sale.”&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

At least one scholar has proposed that this law is unconstitutional in that it effects a Fifth Amendment taking of private property.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

In September 2012, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] published a "[[Notice of Inquiry]]" regarding establishing an artist "resale royalty right" in the US.&lt;ref name="USCO-RRR"&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/ "Resale Royalty Right"], U.S. Copyright Office (last visited October 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Notice was published in response to a request by Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] and Senator [[Herb Kohl]], who had introduced droit de suite legislation in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Resale Royalties: An Updated Analysis|first=Maria|last=Pallante|publisher=Office of the Register of Copyrights|year=2013|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf|accessdate=2015-03-07|ref=harv|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Copyright Office's subsequent report endorsed "congressional consideration of a resale royalty right, or ''droit de suite'', which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party."{{sfn|Pallante|2013|p=10}}  A follow-up bill was introduced in 2014, the American Royalties Too Act, and was vigorously opposed by auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/arts/design/auction-houses-taking-no-chances-on-american-royalties-too-act.html|date=2014-03-24|title=Lobbyists Set to Fight Royalty Bill for Artists|first=Patricia|last=Cohen|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2045|work=Congress.gov|title=S.2045 - American Royalties Too Act of 2014|accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia
The Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au|title=Australasian Legal Information Institute|website=www.austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the creator of an artwork the right to receive a royalty when their work is resold on the commercial art market. For artworks already in existence at 9 June 2010, the royalty applies only to the second and subsequent resales after that date. Under clauses 22 and 23 of the act artists have a case by case right to instruct the appointed government agency the Copyright Agency Ltd,  to not collect and/or make their own individual collection arrangements.

The royalty is calculated as 5% of the sale price, but does not apply where that price is less than $1,000. It is payable, via an official collecting agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.com.au|title=The Copyright Agency|website=Copyright Agency|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''or'' if the creator chooses (on a case by case basis) it can be paid directly to the creator, on resales made during their lifetime and to their heirs for resales made up to 70 years after the creator’s death. The primary legal obligation to pay the royalty rests on the seller. However, in economic terms, it may effectively be passed on to the purchaser.

Eligible artworks include original works of graphic or plastic art, including pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware, photographs, fine art textiles, installations, fine art jewellery, artists’ books, carvings and multi-media artworks.

The royalty is restricted to Australian citizens or residents, though there is provision for reciprocal rights to be extended in the future to persons resident in other jurisdictions with compatible royalty schemes.

The introduction of the scheme was controversial, as it has been elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com|title=Home|website=Journal of ART in SOCIETY|accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three years of its operation, royalty payments totaling $1.5m were made to about 650 artists for 6,800 transactions, with about 50% going to Indigenous artists. The highest individual royalty was A$50,000. Most recipients  have received amounts ranging from A$50 to A$500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au|title=Copyright Agency - Royalty Resale|website=www.resaleroyalty.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average transaction cost is reportedly $30 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/qon/question?number=2677|title=Question on Notice|website=www.aph.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the scheme was announced in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/visual-arts/resale-royalty-scheme|title=Resale Royalty Scheme|first=Department of Communications and the|last=Arts|date=8 August 2016|website=www.arts.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 8293) gives the author/artist or his heirs a 5-percent share in the gross proceeds of the sale or lease of the original painting, sculpture, or manuscript, subsequent to its first disposition by the creator. This right exists during the lifetime of the author or artist and fifty years after his/her death.

[[File:Cat guarding geese c1120 BC Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] cat guarding geese, Egypt, ca. 1120 [[BCE]]]]
'''Fable''' is a literary genre: a succinct [[fiction|fictional]] story, in [[prose]] or [[verse (poetry)|verse]], that features [[animal]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[plant]]s, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak [[human language]]) and that illustrates or leads to a particular [[moral]] lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]&lt;!-- ''most'' of this page is too specific to serve as the only target --&gt; or [[saying]]&lt;!-- this is too much of a compendium to serve as the only target --&gt;.

A fable differs from a [[parable]] in that the latter ''excludes'' animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.

Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]], "{{lang|grc|μῦθος}}" ("''[[mythos]]''") was rendered by the [[Translation|translators]] as "fable"&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]]'', "neither give heed to fables...", and "refuse profane and old wives' fables..." (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Epistle to Titus]] and the [[First Epistle of Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;
Strong's 3454. μύθος muthos moo’-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. &lt;U&gt;fiction&lt;/U&gt; ("myth"):—fable.&lt;br /&gt;"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty." (2nd Peter 1:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who writes fables is a '''fabulist'''.

==History==
The fable is one of the most enduring forms of [[folklore|folk literature]], spread abroad, modern researchers agree,&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'' (1977), see "Fabel", "Äsopica" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.

===Aesopic or Aesop's fable===
The varying corpus denoted ''Aesopica'' or ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the [[legend]]ary [[Aesop]], supposed to have been a slave in [[ancient Greece]] around 550 BCE. When [[Babrius]] set down fables from the ''Aesopica'' in verse for a [[Hellenistic]] Prince "Alexander," he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of "myth" that Aesop had introduced to the "sons of the Hellenes" had been an invention of "Syrians" from the time of "[[Ninus|Ninos]]" (personifying [[Nineveh]] to Greeks) and [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belos]] ("ruler").&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992:121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Buckham, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Many familiar fables of Aesop include "[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]", "[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]" and "[[The Lion and the Mouse]]". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the ''[[progymnasmata]]''—training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.

===Africa===
[[Oral tradition|African oral culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/atim-oton/arits-fables-kids-series_b_1001656.html |author=Atim Oton |title=Reaching African Children Through Fables and Animation |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.

[[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of [[Uncle Remus]]. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie ''[[Song of the South]]'' introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.

===India===
India has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] during the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]], often as [[Story within a story|stories within]] [[frame story|frame stories]]. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the [[Jataka tales]]. These included [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]'', and [[Syntipas]]' ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the [[Old World]]. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the "[[Perry Index]]" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist ''Jataka tales'' and some of the fables in the ''Panchatantra'' may have been influenced by similar [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Near East]]ern ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ben E. Perry, "Introduction", p. xix, in ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as [[Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' also contained fables within the main story, often as [[side story|side stories]] or [[back-story]]. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.

===Europe===
Fables had a further long tradition through the [[Middle Ages]], and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the [[France|French]] fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621–1695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising [[bourgeoisie]], indeed the entire human scene of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at [http://oaks.nvg.org/fontaine.html oaks.nvg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's [[John Gay]] (1685–1732);&lt;ref&gt;His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+gay+++%22fables%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ChY5dZunN&amp;sig=5qBAeejDOY8U5EgxDr4Pgnw68ao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EcNNTLKfGpL24AbX5uCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735–1801);&lt;ref&gt;His ''Bajki przypowiesci'' (Fables &amp; Parables, 1779) are available online at [http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ikbajk/index.htm ug.edu.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's [[:it:Lorenzo Pignotti|Lorenzo Pignotti]] (1739–1812)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSQZlaZjE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8Mlm8LQld&amp;sig=ubnkrD47WARSbDJKUXgNCj7_Vgo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8DhNTP-rOt3NjAeEtLDYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole e Novelle'&amp;#39; (1785) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} and [[:it:Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi|Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi]] (1754–1827);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole'&amp;#39; (1788) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} Serbia's [[Dositej Obradović]] (1739–1811); Spain's [[Félix María de Samaniego]] (1745–1801)&lt;ref&gt;9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at [http://amediavoz.com/samaniego.htm amediavoz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa]] (1750–1791);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tom%C3%A1s+de+Iriarte+y+Oropesa+fabulas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WbHNxf22GV&amp;sig=zrfOpn4x0K8bAykQBwrXmq_zHfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mElNTMGZO5mW4gbNyLCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Fabulas Literarias'&amp;#39; are available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} France's [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] (1755–94);&lt;ref&gt;His five books of fables are available online in French at [http://www.shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm shanaweb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144726/http://shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769–1844).&lt;ref&gt;5 books of fables are available online in Russian at [http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/literature/19century/krylov2.html friends-partners.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. [[Felix Salten]]'s ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'' (1923) is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' — a story of a [[protagonist]]'s coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable. [[James Thurber]] used the ancient fable style in his books ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time]]'' (1940) and ''[[Further Fables for Our Time]]'' (1956), and in his stories "[[The Princess and the Tin Box]]" in ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948) and "The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man" in ''Lanterns and Lances'' (1961). [[Władysław Reymont]]'s ''The Revolt'' (1922), a [[metaphor]] for the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce "equality." [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) similarly satirized [[Stalinist Communism]] in particular, and [[totalitarianism]] in general, in the guise of animal fable.

In the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia’s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book ''[http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPreview?bookid=atafabu_00510018&amp;route=author_Spanish&amp;lang=Spanish&amp;msg&amp;ilang=Spanish "Fábulas Peruanas"] published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.&lt;ref&gt;Juan y Víctor Ataucuri García, "Fábulas Peruanas", Gaviota Azul Editores, Lima, 2003 {{ISBN|9972-2561-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

'''GPS Drawing,''' also known as '''GPS Art''' and '''Strava Art''', is a method of [[drawing]] where an uses a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device and follows a pre planned route to create a large-scale picture or text on a map.  Artists usually run or cycle the route though cars, vans, and aeroplanes are used to create larger pieces. 

==Planning==
GPS artists can spend many hours finding a certain image or text hidden in a map or can sometimes simply see an existing image in a map due to [[Pareidolia]].  In many cities and towns the road layout and landscape restricts the routes available so artisst have to find creative ways to show their pictures or characters.  In cities where there is a strong grid pattern an 8-bit style or [[pixelated]] images can be created of almost any object or shape.  Many artists will create paper or digital maps of their route to follow on their journey.

== Artistic Style ==
There are many approaches to GPS Drawing which an artist can choose depending or their means of travel and the landscape around them.

==== Roads, Trails, and Paths Only ====
This style uses only pre existing roads, paths, trails, etc. which can make it more challenging to find a route and plan the artwork.  On the other hand following these paths makes navigation during the journey much easier and the artwork is more likely to reflect the original plan.  This is how the majority of GPS artworks are made.

==== Freehand on Open Ground or in Open Air ====
Freehand GPS drawing is where artist creates a shape on open ground without following existing paths which means the artist has to watch their progress in real time on their GPS device.  Artists can run or cycle over open ground such as parks, fields, and car parks.  Artists in cars and other motor vehicles can draw shapes on large open areas such as deserts, airfields, and beaches.  Almost all artworks created by aircraft and watercraft use this technique as they are not restricted by human and [[physical geography]].  Freehand GPS drawing opens unlimited possibilities but without [[Waypoint|waypoints]] and existing routes it is very easy to loose track of your progress and make mistakes.

==== Pausing the GPS Device ====
By pausing the GPS device and restarting it at different locations an artist is able to draw straight lines across the map though the built environment and over physical barriers.  Though this can create very striking images and open up new possibilities in a city most artists do not use technique.

==== Adding Extra Images ====
Some artists add extra images or lines to the map after they have created the route.  They can do this to simply add [[googly eyes]] to an animal or face or go further add lines and other features which help viewers see what they have drawn.  Other times an artist will show a photo or other image alongside their drawing if it is not clear at first glance what has been drawn.

== Display ==
Most people use a route mapping app or other service to display their drawing online and to share on social media.  Popular apps include Strava, Map My Run, and Garmin.  Many artists also import their route into [[Google Maps]], [[OpenStreetMap|Open Streetmap]], Viweranger, and other map services before capturing the image to display and share.  This gives the artist the option of expanding and cropping the image, orienting it another way, or tilting the map to add perspective.  Some artists use [[False color|false color maps]] then choose contrasting colors for their route to create vivid images.

==Examples and Artists==
The idea was first implemented by artists Hugh Pryor and [[Jeremy Wood]], whose work includes a 13-mile wide fish in [[Oxfordshire]], spiders with legs 21 miles long in [[Port Meadow, Oxford]],&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; and "the world's biggest 'IF'": a pair of letters, "I", which goes from [[Iffley]] in [[Oxford]] to [[Southampton]] and back, and "F" which traverses through the Ifield Road in [[London]] down to [[Iford, East Sussex]], through [[Iford]] and back up through [[Ifold]] in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; The total length is 537&amp;nbsp;km, and the height of the drawing in [[typographic unit]]s is 319,334,400 [[point (typography)|point]]s.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|title=2003: The 3rd Annual Year in Ideas; GPS Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-gps-art.html|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical computer fonts at standard resolutions are between 8 and 12 points.

In early 2014 programmer Joe Rosen released a GPS-A-Sketch GPS sketching app for iOS, through the iTunes App Store.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 2016, musicians [[Shaun Buswell]] &amp; Erik Nyberg travelled around the [[United Kingdom]] drawing a 400+ mile penis across [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theocelot.co.uk/two-musicians-have-drawn-a-giant-wedding-tackle-during-their-uk-tour-using-gps-tracking/|title=Two musicians have drawn a giant “wedding tackle” during their UK tour using GPS tracking|publisher=The Ocelot|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 artist Nathan Rae created a #WeLoveManchester piece as part of the cememorations of the [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena Bombing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/strava-map-manchester-heart-runner-14694321|title=The runner who made a 67-mile Strava heart all around Manchester|last=Johnson|first=Helen|date=2018-05-23|work=men|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific GPS artists is the artist known as [https://www.instagram.com/wallygpx/ WalleyGPX] who, as of October 2018, has created over 500 pieces of GPS art.  He uses pencil and paper to plan the routes around his home city of [[Baltimore]] which he then creates by bicycle.

This description of the '''history of [[aesthetics]] before the twentieth century''' is based on an article from the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].

==Ancient Greek aesthetics==
The first important contributions to aesthetic theory are usually considered to stem from philosophers in [[Ancient Greece]], among which the most noticeable are [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Plotinus]]. When interpreting writings from this time, it is worth noticing that it is debatable whether an exact equivalent to the term [[beauty]] existed in classical Greek.&lt;ref name="Konstan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xenophon]] regarded the beautiful as coincident with the good, while both of these concepts are resolvable into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because it serves some rational end: either the security or the gratification of man. Socrates rather emphasized the power of beauty to further the more necessary ends of life than the immediate gratification which a beautiful object affords to perception and contemplation.  His doctrine puts forward the relativity of beauty. [[Plato]], in contrast, recognized that beauty exists as an abstract ''[[Theory of Forms|F]][[Theory of Forms|orm]]''. It is therefore absolute and does not necessarily stand in relation to a percipient mind.

===Plato===
Of the views of [[Plato]] on the subject, it is hardly less difficult to gain a clear conception from the ''Dialogues'', than it is in the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-existing forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an attribute in another thing, for these are only beautiful things, not the beautiful itself.  Love ([[Eros (love)|Eros]]) produces aspiration towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula [[kalokagathia]]. So far as his writings embody the notion of any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of color.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a trick of imitation ([[mimesis]]) which takes us another step further from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, in his scheme for an ideal [[Republic (dialogue)|republic]], he provided for the most inexorable censorship of poets, etc., so as to make art as far as possible an instrument of moral and political training.

An example of Plato's considerations about poetry is: "For the authors of those great poems which we admire, do not attain to excellence through the rules of any art; but they utter their beautiful melodies of verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their own."&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Ion Or: On the Iliad&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]], in contrast to Plato, developed certain principles of beauty and art, most clearly so in his treatises on poetry and rhetoric. He saw the absence of all lust or desire in the pleasure it bestows as another characteristic of the beautiful. Aristotle finds (in the ''Metaphysics'') the universal elements of beauty to be order (taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to orismenon).  In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' he adds another essential, namely, a certain magnitude; the object should not be too large, while clearness of perception requires that it should not be too small.

Aristotle was passionate about goodness in men as he valued "taking [its] virtues to be central to a well-lived life."&lt;ref name="Kraut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle's Ethics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-ethics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Politics'', he writes, "Again, men in general desire the good, and not merely what their fathers had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Politics|pages=Book II, 1269.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To thoroughly comprehend goodness, Aristotle also studied [[Beauty]]. As noted in the Encyclopædia Britannica (1902), moreover, Aristotle, "ignores all conceptions of an absolute Beauty, and at the same time seeks to distinguish the Beautiful from the Good." Aristotle explains that men "will be better able to achieve [their] good if [they] develop a fuller understanding of what it is to flourish."&lt;ref name="Kraut"/&gt; He nonetheless seeks (in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'') to distinguish the good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless things as well (`en akinetois.)  At the same time he allowed that the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful. He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in a passage of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' set beauty above the useful and necessary.

Aristotle's views on [[fine art]] distinctly recognized (in the ''Politics'' and elsewhere) that the aim of art is immediate pleasure, as distinct from utility, which is the end of the mechanical arts.  He took a higher view of artistic imitation than Plato, holding that it implied knowledge and discovery, that its objects not only comprised particular things which happen to exist, but contemplated what is probable and what necessarily exists. In the ''Poetics'' he declares poetry to be more philosophical and serious a matter (spoudaiteron) than History.  He gives us no complete classification of the fine arts, and it is doubtful how far his principles, e.g. his idea of a purification of the passions by tragedy, are to be taken as applicable to other than the poetic art.

===Plotinus===
Of the later Greek and Roman writers the Neo-Platonist [[Plotinus]] deserves to be mentioned.  According to him, objective reason (nous) as self-moving, becomes the formative influence which reduces dead matter to form.  Matter when thus formed becomes a notion (logos), and its form is beauty.  Objects are ugly so far as they are unacted upon by reason, and therefore formless.  The creative reason is absolute beauty, and is called the more than beautiful.  There are three degrees or stages of manifested beauty: that of human reason, which is the highest; of the human soul, which is less perfect through its connexion with a material body; and of real objects, which is the lowest manifestation of all.  As to the precise forms of beauty, he supposed, in opposition to Aristotle, that a single thing not divisible into parts might be beautiful through its unity and simplicity.  He gives a high place to the beauty of colours in which material darkness is overpowered by light and warmth.  In reference to artistic beauty he said that when the artist has notions as models for his creations, these may become more beautiful than natural objects.  This is clearly a step away from Plato's doctrine towards our modern conception of artistic idealization.

==Western medieval aesthetics==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] Court School.]]

Surviving [[medieval art]] is primarily religious in focus and funded largely by the [[State (polity)|State]], [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. These art pieces often served a liturgical function, whether as [[Chalice (cup)|chalices]] or even as [[church (building)|church buildings]] themselves. Objects of fine art from this period were frequently made from rare and valuable materials, such as gold and [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], the cost of which commonly exceeded the wages of the artist.

Medieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of [[Plotinus]] by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. [[Bonaventure]]'s "Retracing the Arts to Theology", a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts; which light is guided by the light of [[sense perception]] which discloses the world of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.

Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s aesthetic is probably the most famous and influential theory among medieval authors, having been the subject of much scrutiny in the wake of the neo-Scholastic revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and even having received the approbation of the celebrated Modernist writer, [[James Joyce]]. Thomas, like many other medievals, never gives a systematic account of beauty itself, but several scholars have conventionally arranged his thought—though not always with uniform conclusions—using relevant observations spanning the entire corpus of his work. While Aquinas's theory follows generally the model of [[Aristotle]], he develops a singular aesthetics which incorporates elements unique to his thought. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas'' identifies the three main characteristics of beauty in Aquinas's philosophy: ''integritas sive perfectio'', ''consonantia sive debita proportio'', and ''claritas sive splendor formae''. While Aristotle likewise identifies the first two characteristics, St. Thomas conceives of the third as an appropriation from principles developed by neo-Platonic and Augustinian thinkers. With the shift from the Middle Ages to the [[Renaissance]], art likewise changed its focus, as much in its content as in its mode of expression.

==Age of Enlightenment==

===Addison===
[[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s "Essays on the Imagination" contributed to the ''Spectator'', though they belong to popular literature, contain the germ of scientific analysis in the statement that the pleasures of imagination (which arise originally from sight) fall into two classes — (1) primary pleasures, which entirely proceed from objects before our eyes; and (2) secondary pleasures, flowing from the ideas of visible objects.  The latter are greatly extended by the addition of the proper enjoyment of resemblance, which is at the basis of all mimicry and wit.  Addison recognizes, too, to some extent, the influence of association upon our aesthetic preferences.

===Shaftesbury===
[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] is the first of the intuitional writers on beauty.  In his ''Characteristics'' the beautiful and the good are combined in one ideal conception, much as with [[Plato]].  Matter in itself is ugly.  The order of the world, wherein all beauty really resides, is a spiritual principle, all motion and life being the product of spirit.  The principle of beauty is perceived not with the outer sense, but with an internal or moral sense which apprehends the good as well.  This perception yields the only true delight, namely, spiritual enjoyment.

===Hutcheson===
[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], in his ''System of Moral Philosophy'', though he adopts many of Shaftesbury's ideas, distinctly disclaims any independent self-existing beauty in objects. "All beauty", he says, "is relative to the sense of some mind perceiving it."  One cause of beauty is to be found not in a simple sensation such as colour or tone, but in a certain order among the parts, or "uniformity amidst variety". The faculty by which this principle is discerned is an internal sense which is defined as "a passive power of receiving ideas of beauty from all objects in which there is uniformity in variety". This inner sense resembles the external senses in the immediateness of the pleasure which its activity brings, and further in the necessity of its impressions: a beautiful thing being always, whether we will or no, beautiful.  He distinguishes two kinds of beauty, absolute or original, and relative or comparative.  The latter is discerned in an object which is regarded as an imitation or semblance of another.  He distinctly states that "an exact imitation may still be beautiful though the original were entirely devoid of it." He seeks to prove the universality of this sense of beauty, by showing that all men, in proportion to the enlargement of their intellectual capacity, are more delighted with uniformity than the opposite.

===Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten===

Perhaps the first German philosopher who developed an independent aesthetic theory was [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]. In his best-known work ''Aesthetica'', he complemented the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]-[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolffian]] theory of knowledge by adding to the clear scientific or "logical" knowledge of the understanding the knowledge of the senses, to which he gave the name "aesthetic". It is for this reason that Baumgarten is said to have "coined" the term ''aesthetics''. Beauty to him corresponds to perfect sense-knowledge. Baumgarten reduces taste to an intellectual act and ignores the element of feeling.  To him, nature is the highest embodiment of beauty, and thus art must seek its supreme function in the strictest possible imitation of nature.

===Burke===
[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s speculations, in his ''Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful'', illustrate the tendency of English writers to treat the problem as a psychological one and to introduce physiological considerations.  He finds the elements of beauty to be:-- (1) smallness; (2) smoothness; (3) gradual variation of direction in gentle curves; (4) delicacy, or the appearance of fragility; (5) brightness, purity and softness of colour.  The sublime is rather crudely resolved into astonishment, which he thinks always retains an element of terror.  Thus "infinity has a tendency to fill the mind with a delightful horror." Burke seeks what he calls "efficient causes" for these aesthetic impressions in certain affections of the nerves of sight analogous to those of other senses, namely, the soothing effect of a relaxation of the nerve fibres.  The arbitrariness and narrowness of this theory cannot well escape the reader's attention.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] theory of aesthetic judgments remains a highly debated aesthetic theory until today. It is important to note that Kant uses the term "aesthetics" ("Ästhetik") to refer to any sensual experience.&lt;ref name=Eisler-Aesthetik&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eisler|first1=Rudolf|title=Ästhetik|url=http://www.textlog.de/32225.html|website=Kant-Lexikon|publisher=Rudolf Eisler|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work most crucial to aesthetics as a strand of philosophy is the first half of his [[Critique of Judgment|Critique of the Power of Judgment]], the ''Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment''. It is subdivided in two main parts - the ''Analytic of the Beautiful'' and the ''Analytic of the Sublime'', but also deals with the experience of fine art.

For Kant, '''beauty''' does not reside ''inside'' an object, but is defined as the pleasure that stems from the ″free play″ of imagination and understanding inspired by the object — which as a result we will call beautiful. Such pleasure is more than mere agreeableness, since it must be disinterested and free — that is to say independent from the object's ability to serve as an end to a mean. Even though the feeling of beauty is subjective, Kant goes beyond the notion of ″beauty is in the eye of the beholder″: If something is beautiful to me, I also think that it should be so for everybody else, even though I cannot prove beauty to anyone. Kant also insists that the aesthetic judgment is always, an "individual" i.e. a singular one, of the form "''This'' object (e.g. rose) is beautiful."  He denies that we can reach a valid universal aesthetic judgment of the form "All objects possessing such and such qualities are beautiful." (A judgment of this form would be logical, not aesthetic.) Nature, in Kant's aesthetics, is the primary example for beauty, ranking as a source of aesthetic pleasure above art, which he only considers in the last parts of the third ''Critique of the Aesthetic Judgment''. It is in these last paragraphs where he connects to his earlier works when he argues that the highest significance of beauty is to symbolize moral good; going in this regard even further than [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]].

==German writers==

===Schelling===
[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] is the first thinker to attempt a Philosophy of Art.  He develops this as the third part of his system of transcendental idealism following theoretic and practical philosophy.  (See also Schelling's ''Werke'', Bd. v., and J. Watson, Schelling's ''Transcendental Idealism'', ch. vii., Chicago, 1882.)  According to Schelling a new philosophical significance is given to art by the doctrine that the identity of subject and object — which is half disguised in ordinary perception and volition — is only clearly seen in artistic perception.  The perfect perception of its [[real self]] by intelligence in the work of art is accompanied by a feeling of infinite satisfaction.  Art in thus effecting a revelation of the absolute seems to attain a dignity not merely above that of nature but above that of philosophy itself.  Schelling throws but little light on the concrete forms of beauty.  His classification of the arts, based on his antithesis of object and subject, is a curiosity in intricate arrangement.  He applies his conception in a suggestive way to classical tragedy.

===Hegel===
In [[Hegel]]'s system of philosophy art is viewed as the first stage of the absolute spirit.  (See also ''Werke'', Bd. x., and Bosanquet's ''Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of Fine Art''.)  In this stage the absolute is immediately present to sense-perception, an idea which shows the writer's complete rupture with Kant's doctrine of the "subjectivity" of beauty. The beautiful is defined as the ideal showing itself to sense or through a sensuous medium.  It is said to have its life in show or semblance (Schein) and so differs from the true, which is not really sensuous, but the universal idea contained in sense for thought.  The form of the beautiful is unity of the manifold.  The notion (Begriff) gives necessity in mutual dependence of parts (unity), while the reality demands the semblance (Schein) of liberty in the parts.  He discusses very fully the beauty of nature as immediate unity of notion and reality, and lays great emphasis on the beauty of organic life.  But it is in art that, like Schelling, Hegel finds the highest revelation of the beautiful.  Art makes up for the deficiencies of natural beauty by bringing the idea into clearer light, by showing the external world in its life and spiritual animation.  The several species of art in the ancient and modern worlds depend on the various combinations of matter and form.  He classifies the individual arts according to this same principle of the relative supremacy of form and matter, the lowest being architecture, the highest, poetry.

===Dialectic of the Hegelians===
Curious developments of the Hegelian conception are to be found in the [[dialectic]]al treatment of beauty in its relation to the ugly, the sublime, etc., by Hegel's disciples, e.g. [[Christian Hermann Weisse|C. H. Weisse]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz|J. K. F. Rosenkranz]].  The most important product of the Hegelian School is the elaborate system of aesthetics published by [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer|F. T. Vischer]] (''Esthetik'', 3 Theile, 1846—1834).  It illustrates the difficulties of the Hegelian thought and terminology; yet in dealing with art it is full of knowledge and highly suggestive.

===Schopenhauer===
The aesthetic problem is also treated by two other philosophers whose thought set out from certain tendencies in Kant's system, namely [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]].  Schopenhauer (see also ''The World as Will and Idea'', translated by R. B. Haldane, esp. vol. i. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–346), abandoning also Kant's doctrine of the subjectivity of beauty, found in aesthetic contemplation the perfect emancipation of intellect from will.  In this contemplation the mind is filled with pure intellectual forms, the "Platonic Ideas" as he calls them, which are objectifications of the will at a certain grade of completeness of representation.  He exalts the state of artistic contemplation as the one in which, as pure intellect set free from will, the misery of existence is surmounted and something of blissful ecstasy attained.  He holds that all things are in some degree beautiful, ugliness being viewed as merely imperfect manifestation or objectification of will.  In this way the beauty of nature, somewhat slighted by Schelling and Hegel, is rehabilitated.

===Herbart===
[[Johann Friedrich Herbart|J. F. Herbart]] struck out another way of escaping from Kant's idea of a purely subjective beauty (Kerbach's edition of ''Werke'', Bd. ii. pp.&amp;nbsp;339 et seq.; Bd. iv. pp.&amp;nbsp;105 et seq., and Bd. ix. pp.&amp;nbsp;92 et seq..)  He did, indeed, adopt Kant's view of the aesthetic Judgment as singular ("individual"); though he secures a certain degree of logical universality for it by emphasizing the point that the predicate (beauty) is permanently true of the same aesthetic object.  At the same time, by referring the beauty of concrete objects to certain aesthetic relations, he virtually accepted the possibility of universal aesthetic judgments (compare above).  Since he thus reduces beauty to abstract relations he is known as a [[formalism (philosophy)|formalist]], and the founder of the formalistic school in aesthetics.  He sets out with the idea that only relations please — in the Kantian sense of producing pleasure devoid of desire; and his aim is to determine the "aesthetic elementary relations", or the simplest relations which produce this pleasure.  These include those of will, so that, as he admits, ethical judgments are in a manner brought under an aesthetic form.  His typical example of aesthetic relations of objects of sense-perception is that of harmony between tones.  The science of [[figured bass|thorough-bass]] has, he thinks, done for music what should be done also for other departments of aesthetic experience.  This doctrine of elementary relations is brought into connexion with the author's psychological doctrine of presentations with their tendencies to mutual inhibition and to fusion, and of the varying feeling-tones to which these processes give rise.  This mode of treating the problem of beauty and aesthetic perception has been greatly developed and worked up into a comrlete system of aesthetics by one of Herbart's disciples, Robert Zimmermann (''Asthetik'', 1838).

===Lessing===
[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], in his ''Laocoon'' and elsewhere, sought to deduce the special function of an art from a consideration of the means at its disposal.  He took pains to define the boundaries of poetry and upon the ends and appliances of art.  Among these his distinction between arts which employ the coexistent in space and those which employ the successive (as poetry and music) is of lasting value.  In his dramatic criticisms he similarly endeavoured to develop clear general principles on such points as poetic truth, improving upon Aristotle, on whose teaching he mainly relies.

===Goethe and Schiller===
[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote several tracts on aesthetic topics, as well as many aphorisms.  He attempted to mediate between the claims of ideal beauty, as taught by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J. J. Winckelmann]], and the aims of dualization.  [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] discusses, in a number of disconnected essays and letters some of the main questions in the philosophy of art.  He looks at art from the side of culture and the forces of human nature, and finds in an aesthetically cultivated soul the reconciliation of the sensual and rational.  His letters on aesthetic education (''Uber die asthetische Erziehung des Menschen'', trans. by J. Weiss, Boston, 1845) are valuable, bringing out among other points the connexion between aesthetic activity and the universal impulse to play (Spieltrieb).  Schiller's thoughts on aesthetic subjects are pervaded with the spirit of Kant's philosophy.

===Jean Paul Richter===
Another example of this kind of reflective discussion of art by literary men is afforded us in the Vorschule der Asthetik of [[Jean Paul|Jean Paul Richter]].  This is a rather ambitious discussion of the sublime and ludicrous, which, however, contains much valuable matter on the nature of humour in romantic poetry.  Among other writers who reflect more or less philosophically on the problems to which modern poetry gives rise are [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], the two Schlegels ([[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]]) and [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus|Gervinus]].

===Contributions by German savants===
A word may be said in conclusion on the attempts of German savants to apply a knowledge of physiological conditions to the investigation of the sensuous elements of aesthetic effect, as well as to introduce into the study of the simpler aesthetic forms the methods of natural science.  The classic work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] on "Sensations of Tone" is a highly musical composition on physics and physiology.  The endeavour to determine with a like degree of precision the physiological conditions of the pleasurable effects of colours and their combinations by [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke|E. W. Brucke]], [[Ewald Hering]] and more recent investigators, has so far failed to realize the desideratum laid down by Herbart, that there should be a theory of colour-relations equal in completeness and exactness to that of tone-relations.  The experimental inquiry into simple aesthetically pleasing forms was begun by [[Gustav Fechner|G. T. Fechner]] in seeking to test the soundness of Adolf Zeising's hypothesis that the most pleasing proportion in dividing a line, say the vertical part of a cross, is the "golden section", where the smaller division is to the larger as the latter to the sum. He describes in his work on "Experimental Aesthetics" (''Auf experimentalen Asthetik'') a series of experiments carried out on a large number of persons, bearing on this point, the results of which he considers to be in favour of Zeising's hypothesis.

==French writers==
In [[France]] aesthetic speculation grew out of the discussion by poets and critics on the relation of modern art; and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] in the 17th century, the development of the dispute between the "ancients" and the "moderns" at the end of the 17th century by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|B. le Bouvier de Fontenelle]] and [[Charles Perrault]], and the continuation of the discussion as to the aims of poetry and of art generally in the 18th century by [[Voltaire]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and others, not only offer to the modern theorists valuable material in the shape of a record by experts of their aesthetic experience, but disclose glimpses of important aesthetic principles. [[Yves Marie André]]'s ''Essay on Beauty'' was an exploration of visual, musical, moral, and intellectual beauty. A more systematic examination of the several arts (corresponding to that of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]) is to be found in the ''Cours de belles lettres'' of [[Charles Batteux]] (1765), in which the meaning and value of the imitation of nature by art are further elucidated, and the arts are classified (as by Lessing) according as they employ the forms of space or those of time.

===Theories of organic beauty: Buffier===
The beginning of a more scientific investigation of beauty in general is connected with the name of [[Claude Buffier|Pere Buffier]] (see ''First Truths''), form, and illustrates his theory by the human face.  A beautiful face is at once the most common and most rare among members of the species.  This seems to be a clumsy way of saying that it is a clear expression of the typical form of the species.

===Hippolyte Taine===
This idea of typical beauty (which was adopted by [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]]) has been worked out more recently by [[Hippolyte Taine]].  In his work, ''The Ideal in Art'' (trans. by I. Durand), he proceeds in the manner of a botanist to determine a scale of characters in the physical and moral man.  The degree of the universality or importance of a character, and of its beneficence or adaptation to the ends of life, determine the measure of its aesthetic value, and render the work of art, which seeks to represent it in its purity, an ideal work.

===French systems of aesthetics: The ''spiritualistes''===
The only elaborated systems of aesthetics in French literature are those constructed by the ''spiritualistes'', the philosophic writers who under the influence of German thinkers effected a reaction against the crude sensationalism of the 18th century.  They aim at elucidating the higher and spiritual element in aesthetic impressions, appearing to ignore any capability in the sensuous material of affording a true aesthetic delight.  [[Victor Cousin]] and Jean Charles Leveque are the principal writers of this school.  The latter developed an elaborate system of the subject (''La Science du beau'').  All beauty is regarded as spiritual in its nature.  The several beautiful characters of an organic body — of which the principal are magnitude, unity and variety of parts, intensity of colour, grace or flexibility, and correspondence to environment — may be brought under the conception of the ideal grandeur and order of the species.  These are perceived by reason to be the manifestations of an invisible vital force.  Similarly the beauties of inorganic nature are to be viewed as the grand and orderly displays of an immaterial physical force.  Thus all beauty is in its objective essence either spirit or unconscious force acting with fulness and in order.

==British writers==
There is nothing answering to the German conception of a system of aesthetics in English literature.  The inquiries of English thinkers have been directed for the most part to such modest problems as the psychological process by which we perceive the beautiful — discussions which are apt to be regarded by German historians as devoid of real philosophical value.  The writers may be conveniently arranged in two divisions, answering to the two opposed directions of English thought: (1) the Intuitionalists, those who recognize the existence of an objective beauty which is a simple unanalysable attribute or principle of things; and (2) the Analytical theorists, those who follow the analytical and psychological method, concerning themselves with the sentiment of beauty as a complex growth out of simpler elements.

===The Intuitionists===

====Reid====
In his ''Essays on the Intellectual Powers'' (viii. "Of Taste") [[Thomas Reid]] applies his principle of common sense to the problem of beauty saying that objects of beauty agree not only in producing a certain agreeable emotion, but in the excitation along with this emotion of a belief that they possess some perfection or excellence, that beauty exists in the objects independently of our minds.  His theory of beauty is severely spiritual.  All beauty resides primarily in the faculties of the mind, intellectual and moral.  The beauty which is spread over the face of visible nature is an emanation from this spiritual beauty, and is beauty because it symbolizes and expresses the latter.  Thus the beauty of a plant resides in its perfect adaptation to its end, a perfection which is an expression of the wisdom of its Creator.

====Hamilton====
In his ''Lectures on Metaphysics'' [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir W. Hamilton]] gives a short account of the sentiments of taste, which (with a superficial resemblance to Kant) he regards as subserving both the subsidiary and the elaborative faculties in cognition, that is, the imagination and the understanding.  The activity of the former corresponds to the element of variety in a beautiful object, that of the latter with its unity.  He explicitly excludes all other kinds of pleasure, such as the sensuous, from the proper gratification of beauty.  He denies that the attribute of beauty belongs to fitness.

====Ruskin====
[[John Ruskin]]'s well-known speculations on the nature of beauty in ''Modern Painters'' ("Of ideas of beauty"), though sadly wanting in scientific precision, have a certain value in the history of divine attributes.  Its true nature is appreciated by the theoretic faculty which is concerned in the moral conception and appreciation of ideas of beauty, and must be distinguished from the imaginative or artistic faculty, which is employed in regarding in a certain way and combining the ideas received from external nature.  He distinguishes between typical and vital beauty.  The former is the external quality of bodies which typifies some divine attribute.  The latter consists in "the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function in living things". The forms of typical beauty are:-- (1) infinity, the type of the divine incomprehensibility; (2) unity, the type of the divine comprehensiveness; (3) repose, the type of the divine permanence; (4) symmetry, the type of the divine justice; (5) purity, the type of the divine energy; and (6) moderation, the type of government by law.  Vital beauty, again, is regarded as relative when the degree of exaltation of the function is estimated, or generic if only the degree of conformity of an individual to the appointed functions of the species is taken into account.  Ruskin's writings illustrate the extreme tendency to identify aesthetic with moral perception.

===The analytical theorists===

====Home====
In the ''Elements of Criticism'' of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Home (Lord Kames)]] another attempt is made to resolve the pleasure of beauty into its elements.  Beauty and ugliness are simply the pleasant and he appears to admit no general characteristic of beautiful objects beyond this power of yielding pleasure.  Like Hutcheson, he divides beauty into intrinsic and relative, but understands by the latter the appearance of fitness and utility, which is excluded from the beautiful by Hutcheson.

====Hogarth====
Passing by the name of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose theory of beauty closely resembles that of [[Claude Buffier|Pere Buffier]], we come to the articulations of another artist and painter, [[William Hogarth]].  He discusses, in his ''Analysis of Beauty'', all the elements of visual beauty.  He finds in this the following elements:-- (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye "a wanton kind of chase"; (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe.  The beauty of proportion he resolves into the needs of fitness.  Hogarth applies these principles to the determination of the degrees of beauty in lines, figures and groups of forms.  Among lines he singles out for special honour the serpentine (formed by drawing a line once round from the base to the apex of a long slender cone).

====Alison====
[[Archibald Alison (Scottish author)|Alison]], in his well-known ''Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste'', proceeds by a method exactly the opposite to that of Hogarth and Burke.  He seeks to analyse the mental process then finds that this consists in a peculiar operation of the imagination, namely, the flow of a train of ideas through the mind, which ideas always correspond to some simple affection or emotion (e.g. cheerfulness, sadness, awe) awakened by the object.  He thus makes association the sole source of aesthetic delight, and denies the existence of a primary source in sensations themselves.  He illustrates the working of the principle of association at great length, and with much skill; yet his attempt to make it the unique source of aesthetic pleasure fails completely.  [[Francis Jeffrey]]'s ''Essays on Beauty'' (in the Edinburgh Review, and Encyclopædia Britannica, 8th edition) are little more than a modification of Alison's theory.  ''Philosophical Essays'' consists in pointing out the unwarranted assumption lurking in the doctrine of a single quality running through all varieties of beautiful object.  He seeks to show how the successive changes in the meaning of the term "beautiful" have arisen.  He suggests that it originally connoted the pleasure of colour.  The value of his discussion resides more in the criticism of his predecessors than in the contribution of new ideas.  His conception of the sublime, suggested by the etymology of the word, emphasizes the element of height in objects.

Of the association psychologists [[James Mill]] did little more towards the analysis of the sentiments of beauty than re-state Alison's doctrine.  [[Alexander Bain]], in his treatise, ''The Emotions and the Will'' ("Aesthetic Emotions"), carries this examination considerably further.  He seeks to differentiate aesthetic from other varieties of pleasurable emotion by three characteristics:-- (1) their freedom from life-serving uses, being gratifications sought for their own sakes; (2) their purity from all disagreeable concomitants; (3) their eminently sympathetic or shareable nature.  He takes a comprehensive view of the constituents of aesthetic enjoyment, including the pleasures of sensation and of its revived or its "ideal" form; of revived emotional states; and lastly the satisfaction of those wide-ranging susceptibilities which we call the love of novelty, of contrast and of harmony.  The effect of sublimity is connected with the manifestation of superior power in its highest degrees, which manifestation excites a sympathetic elation in the beholder.  The ludicrous, again, is defined by Bain, improving on Aristotle and Hobbes, as the degradation of something possessing dignity in circumstances that excite no other strong emotion.

====Spencer====
[[Herbert Spencer]], in his ''First Principles'', ''Principles of Psychology'' and ''Essays'', has given an interesting turn to the psychology of aesthetics by the application of his doctrine of evolution.  Adopting [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s idea of a connexion between aesthetic activity and play, he seeks to make it the starting-point in tracing the evolution of aesthetic activity.  Play is defined as the outcome of the superfluous energies of the organism: as the activity of organs and faculties which, owing to a prolonged period of inactivity, have become specially ready to discharge their function, and as a consequence vent themselves in simulated actions.  Aesthetic activities supply a similar mode of self-relieving discharge to the higher organs of perception and emotion; and they further agree with play in not directly subserving any processes conducive to life; in being gratifications sought for their own sake only.  Spencer seeks to construct a hierarchy of aesthetic pleasures according to the degree of complexity of the faculty exercised: from those of sensation up to the revived emotional experiences which constitute the aesthetic sentiment proper.  Among the more vaguely revived emotions Spencer includes more permanent feelings of the race transmitted by heredity; as when he refers the deep and indefinable emotion excited by music to associations with vocal tones expressive of feeling built up during the history of our species.  This biological treatment of aesthetic activity has had a wide influence, some e.g. [[Grant Allen]] being content to develop his evolutional method.  Yet, as suggested above, his theory is now recognized as taking us only a little way towards an adequate understanding of our aesthetic experience.

Any aesthetic doctrines that guided the production and interpretation of [[prehistoric art]] are mostly unknown. An indirect concern with aesthetics can be inferred from [[ancient art]] in many early civilizations, including [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[China]], the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[History of India|India]], the [[Celtic art|Celtic peoples]], and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], as each of them developed a unique and characteristic style in its art.

===Western aesthetics===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Western aesthetics usually refers to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers as the earliest source of formal aesthetic considerations. [[Plato]] believed in beauty as a ''form'' in which beautiful objects partake and which causes them to be beautiful. He felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, [[harmony]], and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] found that the universal elements of beauty were order, [[symmetry]], and definiteness.

From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called [[modernism]]. German and British thinkers emphasized beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at absolute beauty.

For [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For [[Immanuel Kant]] the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but similar human truth, since all people should agree that "this [[rose]] is beautiful" if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For [[Friedrich Schiller]] aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature.

For [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], the philosophy of art is the "organon" of philosophy concerning the relation between man and nature. So aesthetics began now to be the name for the ''philosophy of art''. [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] also gave lectures on aesthetics as ''philosophy of art'' after 1800.

For Hegel, all culture is a matter of "absolute spirit" coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage, changing to a [[perfection]] that only philosophy can approach. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty.

For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. It is thus for Schopenhauer one way to fight the [[suffering]].

The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]] this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which is a linguistic impossibility. Hence his viewpoint can be paraphrased as "That which constitutes aesthetics lies outside the realm of the language game".

[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745]]
For [[Oscar Wilde]], the contemplation of beauty for beauty's sake (augmented by [[John Ruskin]]'s search for moral grounding) was more than the foundation for much of his literary career; he once stated, "Aestheticism is a search after the signs of the beautiful. It is the science of the beautiful through which men seek the correlation of the arts. It is, to speak more exactly, the search after the secret of life.".&lt;ref&gt;"Oscar Wilde" by [[Richard Ellman]] p 122, pub Alfred A Knopf, INC. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde toured the United States in 1882 spreading the idea of Aesthetics in a speech called "The English Renaissance". In his speech he proposed that Beauty and Aesthetics were "not languid but energetic. By beautifying the outward aspects of life, one would beautify the inner ones." The English Renaissance was, he said, "like the Italian Renaissance before it, a sort of rebirth of the spirit of man".&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[William Hogarth]], and [[Edmund Burke]] hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye on "a wanton kind of chase"; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of [[psychology]] (such as [[James Mill]]) or [[biology]] (such as [[Herbert Spencer]]).

===Indian aesthetics===
{{main|Rasa (aesthetics)}}

The Indian aesthetics tradition traces to the [[Vedas|Vedic]] era texts of [[Hinduism]]. The Aitareya [[Brahmana]] (~1000 BCE) in section 6.27, for example, states the arts are a refinement of the self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]]-samskrti'').&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arindam Chakrabarti|title=The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Indian Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXFYCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4725-2430-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving complete Sanskrit manuscript that discusses a theory of aesthetics is of ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', estimated to have been complete between 200 BCE and 200 CE.{{sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} This theory is called ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' in the text. ''Rasa'' is an ancient concept in Indian arts about the aesthetic flavor of any visual, literary or musical work, that evokes an emotion or feeling in the reader or audience, but that cannot be described.&lt;ref name=britrasa&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rasa Rasa: Indian Aesthetic Theory], Encyclopedia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Natya shastra'', the goal of arts is to empower aesthetic experience, deliver emotional ''rasa'' (juice, taste). In many cases, art aims to produce repose and relief for those exhausted with labor, or distraught with grief, or laden with misery, or struck by austere times.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2016p1"/&gt; Yet entertainment is an effect, but not the primary goal of arts according to ''Natya shastra''. The primary goal is to create ''rasa'' so as to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Schwartz |title=Rasa: Performing the Divine in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BXVSmT1WhMC |year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13144-5|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer102&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=73, 102–106, 120, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most complete exposition of aesthetics in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri [[Shaivism|Shaivite]]-Hindu philosopher [[Abhinavagupta]] (c. 1000 CE).&lt;ref name=britrasa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer102/&gt; Abhinavagupta's analysis of ''Natyasastra'' is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions.{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=22-24}}

The concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of [[Indian art]]s including [[Dance in India|dance]], [[Indian classical music|music]], theatre, painting, sculpture, and [[Indian literature|literature]], the interpretation and implementation of a particular rasa differs between different styles and schools.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|pp=249-252}}{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=327-333}}&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"&gt;{{cite book|author= W.S.

In the aesthetic theories of Indian poetics, its ancient scholars discuss both what is stated and how it is stated (words, grammar, rhythm), suggesting that the meaning of the text and the experience of ''rasa'' are both important.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"/&gt; Among the most celebrated in Hindu traditions on the theory of poetics and literary works, are 5th-century [[Bhartṛhari|Bhartrhari]] and the 9th-century Anandavardhana, but the theoretical tradition on integrating ''rasa'' into literary artworks likely goes back to a more ancient period. This is generally discussed under the Indian concepts of ''Dhvani'', ''Sabdatattva'' and ''Sphota''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sebastian Alackapally|title=Being and Meaning: Reality and Language in Bhartṛhari and Heidegger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liCLrmfnKSoC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1803-3|pages=78–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2012p295"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold G.

In the Indian theories on sculpture and architecture (''[[Shilpa Shastras]]''), the ''rasa'' theories, in part, drive the forms, shapes, arrangements and expressions in images and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner|author2=Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā|author3=Bettina Bäumer|title=The essence of form in sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2eKhTXstG4C&amp;pg=PA72 |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0090-8|pages=72–78, 45–46, 57–58, 115–116, 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB3oCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508341-5|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese aesthetics===
[[Chinese art]] has a long history of varied styles and emphases. [[Confucius]] emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding ''li'' (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent [[Mozi]], however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich over the poor.

By the 4th century AD artists had started debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. [[Gu Kaizhi]] has left three surviving books on the theory of painting. Several later artists or scholars both created art and wrote about the creation of it. Religious and philosophical influences on art were common (and diverse) but never universal.

Modern Chinese aesthetic theory took shape during the modernization of China from Empire to republic in early 20th century. Thus thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Marx and Heidegger have all been incorporated into contemporary Chinese aesthetic theory, through philosophers like Li Zehou.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Zehou]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===African aesthetics===
[[African art]] is the cultural expression of a vast and rich continent.  It is the product of millennia of changes, migrations, international and intercontinental trade, diplomacy and cultural norms.  Within the scholarship surrounding African art, there is some question in using the word "art" to describe it. Malidoma and Sonbofu Somé,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somé|first1=Malidoma|title=The Healing Wisdom of Africa|date=1999|publisher=TarcherPerigee|isbn=087477991X|pages=352 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somé|first1=Sonbofu|title=The Spirit of Intimacy|date=2000|publisher=William Morrow Publications|isbn=0688175791|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; cultural emissaries of the Dagara of Burkina Faso hold that within their culture the closest word for art is simply the word "sacred".  Kongo [[nkisi]] power objects illustrate this point.  They are objects traded on the contemporary art market on aesthetic value, however their purpose was to serve in rituals of personal and community healing.  Consideration is due, when viewing African cultural product, in understanding the primary function of these objects held within the cultures themselves.

There is a wonderful interplay between practicality and aesthetic in African material culture.  Consider the [[Akan people|Akan]] stool, [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] adire cloth and combs, or [[Gio people|Gio]] spoons.  Here you have an example of the African genius in enlivening the most mundane object into an aesthetic presence.  Sculpture and [[performance art]] are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest. The [[Nok culture]] is testimony to this. The mosque of [[Timbuktu]] shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics.

===Arab aesthetics===
[[File:Great Mosque of Djenné 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné|Great Mosque]]'s signature trio of [[minaret]]s overlooks the central market of [[Djenné]]. Unique Malian aesthetic]]
Arab art has the context of [[Islam]], started in the 7th century, is sometimes referred to as [[Islamic art]], although many Arab artists throughout time have not been Muslim. The term "Islamic" refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created by people in an [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]] or in an Islamic context, whether the artist is Islamic or not. Not all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts. Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some [[Kalam|Islamic theologians]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Although the often cited opposition in Islam to the depiction of human and animal forms holds true for religious art and architecture, in the secular sphere, such representations have flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures.

The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the [[Day of Judgment]]. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms," or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. Iconoclasm was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Human portrayals can be found in early Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. Human representation for the purpose of worship is uniformly considered [[idolatry]] as forbidden in ''[[Sharia]]'' law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [Wijdan Ali], American Univ in Cairo Press, 10 December 1999, {{ISBN|977-424-476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th century Ottoman Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201123841/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }}, [Steve Mwai], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p.&amp;nbsp;1–24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is written from right to left, like other [[Semitic scripts]], and consists of 17 characters, which, with the addition of dots placed above or below certain of them, provide the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet. Short vowels are not included in the alphabet, being indicated by signs placed above or below the consonant or long vowel that they follow. Certain characters may be joined to their neighbours, others to the preceding one only, and others to the succeeding one only. The written letters undergo a slight external change according to their position within a word. When they stand alone or occur at the end of a word, they ordinarily terminate in a bold stroke; when they appear in the middle of a word, they are ordinarily joined to the letter following by a small, upward curved stroke. With the exception of six letters, which can be joined only to the preceding ones, the initial and medial letters are much abbreviated, while the final form consists of the initial form with a triumphant flourish. The essential part of the characters, however, remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/IntroIslamicCalligraphy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability sidebar}}
The '''InterACT Disability Arts Festival''' is an annual three-day event which showcases the talents of disabled performers, authors, artists, and artisans in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The event has been described by the [[Minister for Disability Issues]], [[Tariana Turia]], as "a chance for people of all abilities to celebrate and share their talents with us all"&lt;ref name="tariana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=79010 |title=Minister encourages wider community to support New Zealand's first Disability Arts Festival this weekend |publisher=Infonews.co.nz |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was inspired by the [[Awakenings Festival]] of [[Horsham, Victoria]], Australia. It wasn't until five years after a visit to the 2007 Awakenings festival by three representatives of the Interacting Theatre Company, that the inaugural InterACT festival was held in Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Chris Laidlaw, Chris Tally Evans, Paula Crimmens, Trina Armstrong|date=2011-10-30 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |medium=Radio broadcast |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |accessdate=2013-09-20 |time=00:28:40 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |quote=I work for Interacting, which is a disabled arts theatre company. And I went with Trina and our Chair[person] to Australia, to the Awakenings festival in 2007. It's taken us this long to decide we wanted to put on a festival, because essentially we're a theatre company and we do two productions a year. But last year we decided we were in a position with sufficient support networks and relationships with other organisations to go for it, and to put on a New Zealand version of the annual Awakenings festival in Australia. |ref= }}&lt;!--{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2501301/ideas-for-30-october-2011 |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Sunday Morning : 30 Oct 2011 : Ideas for 30 October 2011 |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 edition of the festival is scheduled for 23–25 October and the venue will be Corban's Estate Arts Centre, [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacting.org.nz/interactfestival/ |title=InterACT Disability Arts Festival |publisher=Interacting.org.nz |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kossuth Prize''' ({{lang-hu|Kossuth-díj}}) is a state-sponsored award in [[Hungary]], named after the Hungarian politician and revolutionary [[Lajos Kossuth]]. The Prize was established in 1948 (on occasion of the centenary of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|March 15th revolution]], the day on which it is still handed over every year) by the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], to acknowledge outstanding personal and group achievements in the fields of science, culture and the arts, as well as in the building of [[Socialism]] in general.

In 1950s the award was given to Gabor Bela Fodor for his contributions in the field of Chemistry as the prize was given to selected scientists. Since 1963, the domain was restricted to culture and the arts. Today, it is regarded as the most prestigious cultural award in Hungary, and is awarded by the [[President of Hungary|President]].

'''Krip-Hop''' is a movement demonstrating alternate arrangements by which [[hip hop]] artists with disabilities can communicate through social media, including [[Education|educators]],  [[journalist]]s and conferences. The movement uses hip hop music as a means of expression for the disabled, providing them an opportunity to share their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choy|first1=Allie|date=February 12, 2012|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues|title=Krip-hop nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Not History}}History==
Krip Hop was founded by [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.]], an African American writer, [[poet]], community [[Activism|activist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] who was diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]]. Moore was born in New York in 1967 to an activist father loosely connected to the Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayabolition.com/2013/02/23/leroy-moore/|title=Interview with Leroy Moore |publisher=Everyday Abolition/Abolition Every Day |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing sensitized Moore to the challenges faced by African Americans and the disabled.&lt;ref name="amoeba"/&gt; As a youth, Moore discovered that most people had little knowledge of the historical impact of disabled African Americans. This led him to begin research, initially in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2008/07/jamoeblog/krip-hop-project-s-leroy-f-moore-on-being-black-disabled.html |title=Krip-Hop Project's Leroy F Moore On Being Black &amp; Disabled |publisher=The Amoeblog |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore first spotlighted disabled hip hop artists in the early 2000s. He co-produced and co-hosted a three-part series on what he called "Krip Hop" for a Berkeley, California radio station. The "Krip Hop" series appeared on [[KPFA]]'s ''Pushing Limits'', which focuses on news, arts, and culture for the disabled community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hix |first=Lisa |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/performance/article.jsp?essid=43903 |title=Interview with Leroy Moore, Founder of Krip Hop Nation |publisher=KQED Public Media |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' popularity inspired Moore to create Krip Hop Nation for disabled musicians, since little cultural work or music by people with disabilities had been recognized.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; "The Krip-Hop movement really makes the pain of the people feel visible", Moore said. "It goes a lot deeper than what people can see."&lt;ref name="uwdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues#.UoBI-ZTF1mk |work=The Daily |publisher=University of Washington |author=Allie Choy |date=12 February 2012 |title=Krip-Hop Nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111040926/http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Krip Hop Nation==
The primary goal of Krip Hop Nation is to increase awareness in music and media outlets of the talents, history and rights of people with disabilities in the hip-hop industry. In an interview, Moore expressed the hope that by listening to his music the audience would understand the need to question authority and the information provided to them. He said he wanted his listeners to learn about their community and to become open to all people. Issues such as racism and sexism are commonly discussed, and Moore hoped that people would examine possible [[ableism]] in their attitudes.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt; According to Moore, Krip Hop Nation goes beyond producing music and the [[bling-bling]] associated with hip hop; the movement is about advocacy, education and overcoming oppression. For Moore the movement has sought to reclaim negative terms associated with the disabled (such as "crazy", "lame", "retarded" and "cripple"), using them to shock people into understanding and respecting the disabled African American community.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt; Krip Hop Nation addresses discrimination against disabled artists in hip hop by publishing articles and hosting events, lectures and workshops. It has over 300 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is self-published.|date=March 2015}}

Moore has explained that "Krip Hop" is a play on "Hip Hop." Although the "Krip" part of the name refers to "crippled", it is spelled with a "k" to avoid association with the [[Crips]].&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Krip Hop Nation has released two mixtape CDs, held conferences with the PeaceOut HomoHop organization at UC Berkeley and New York University, organized and hosted a six-artist performance in Sacramento, California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 2011 End of the Year Accomplishments.] Accessed 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; staged a show at Disability and Deaf Arts (DADA) in [[Liverpool]] and hosted a Krip Hop Nation conference in Atlanta, Georgia for [[Black History Month]] in 2011 featuring musicians, writers and activists.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

In February 2012, DJ Quad of 5th Battalion joined Krip Hop Nation to co-produce a CD with 17 disabled artists from the UK, the US and Germany on police brutality and profiling. Among the collaborators was Emmitt Thrower of Artist Magnet. The documentary was scheuled for release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leroy |url=http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 |title=Krip-Hop Nation End of the Year Accomplishments 2012 |publisher=POOR Magazine/Prensa POBRE |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable musicians==
Krip Hop Nation includes artists such as Counterclockwise, Preach-man, Wheelchair Sports Camp, Miss Money and Fezo.&lt;ref name="wheres-lulu"/&gt; [[Kalyn Heffernan]] is a rapper from [[Denver]], Colorado. With [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]], Heffernan is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|cm}} tall and uses a wheelchair. She heads Wheelchair Sports Camp, an experimental hip-hop group with jazz and avant-garde influences. Her raps are political, with many discussing the difficulties she faces as a disabled person in America. Heffernan created beats for Haitian rappers in the area dealing with extreme poverty after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentile |first=Joseph |url=https://www.vice.com/read/everyone-in-this-wheelchair-sports-camp-is-stoned-and-making-beats |title=Everyone in This Wheelchair Sports Camp Is Stoned and Making Beats |publisher=Vice |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 she was arrested after a 3-day sitdown protest at her GOP Senator's office, remarking "I'd rather go to jail than to die without [[Medicaid]]" in regards to [[Trumpcare]]. &lt;ref name="Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/880782432064110592 |title=Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest |last=Leah McElrath   |first=Leah |date=2017-07-01 |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lath art''' is a form of [[woodworking]] [[folk art]] for making rustic pictures out of strips out of old "[[lath]]" from "[[plaster]] and lath" walls. Today it is commonly made from lattice, lumber stickers and [[weathering|weathered]] [[lobster trap]]s. Beach scenes and rural scenes are the most popular themes. 

==Techniques==
  
Lath art has a lot in common with [[marquetry]] and [[intarsia]]. They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of wood, but marquetry  and intarsia use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the [[lath]] stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.

'''Meditative poetry''' combines the religious practice of [[meditation]] with [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It occurs in many cultures, especially in Asian, European and Hindu cultures. Especially [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988;73-88).

In [[Christianity]], meditation became a major [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] practice during the [[Middle Ages]], closely associated with the life in [[monasteries]]. Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from [[contemplation]]. While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the [[Bible]], contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind. Both, contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Jesuits like [[Ignatius of Loyola]] formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding and will. His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points ([[analysis]]); the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32). [[Jesuits]] brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72). [[Calvinist]] and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.

[[Puritan]] meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life. In 1628, [[Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576–1633)|Thomas Taylor]] wrote a Puritan handbook ''Meditation from the Creatures'', recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory). In colonial [[New England]], [[Thomas Hooker]] defined meditation in ''The Souls Preparation for Christ'' (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."

In 1648, the ''Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly'' made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 [[Richard Baxter]]'s ''The Saints' Everlasting Rest'' became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation. Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses, that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible. By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).

Soon Puritan ministers like [[Edward Taylor]] began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both [[allegorical]] of the greater glory of God. [[Anne Bradstreet]] provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God. Using the [[analogy]] of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the early allegoric technique with a more [[symbol]]ic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57). 

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay ''Nature'' (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible. He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use simply relying on their [[imagination]]. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).

The method of the three main steps (composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation. Leading modernist poets like [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] began to fragmentarize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12). Postmodernist poets like [[John Ashbery]] deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the [[reference]] of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving [[narrative]] or [[Episode|episodic]] structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation. 

Meditative poetry has often been correlated to [[Relaxation Through Poetry]], which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need. It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.

A '''modello''' {{IPA-it|moˈdɛllo|}} (plural '''modelli'''), from Italian,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modello'' avoids the ambiguity in English of ''model'', which may equally refer to the finished [[work of art]] that provided detailed inspiration for a variant or later copy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Modello Glossary, National Gallery, London]; Irene Earls; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAdrziNnqLIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U36ePp8oMeVe0otIfoYZyo8eDz0Yw ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in art circles in [[Tuscany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376–1508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, "A Note on the Word Modello', ''The Art Bulletin'' '''74'''.1 (March 1992:172–173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the [[Marche]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are "[[oil sketch]]" (''schizzo'') and "[[cartoon]]" for [[painting]]s or [[stained glass]], [[maquette]], plastico or bozzetto&lt;ref&gt;A ''bozzetto'' is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; for sculpture or architecture, or [[architectural model]].&lt;ref&gt;Fourteenth century uses of ''modello'' in connection with [[Santa Reparata, Florence]], are noted in A. Grote, ''Studien zur Geschichte der Opera Santa Reparata zu Florenz in Vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' (Munich 1960:113ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra&lt;ref&gt;The Latin term ''modulus'', a synonym of ''typus'', "[[archetype]]" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan [[Accademia della Crusca]]'s early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also [[Donor portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of buildings they had constructed—"models" in the familiar modern sense—''modello'' is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelangelo]] was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio ''modelli'' done to his specifications: "in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as [[Tommaso de' Cavallieri]]", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes "A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'" ''Master Drawings'' '''26'''.3 (Autumn 1988:239–248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of ''modello'' for the lost original of two copies in public collections. In the case of architectural ''modelli'', the actual construction could be by craftsmen from drawings by the architect. A discussion about a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] drawing that illustrates when the term is appropriate to use is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 note 23 on page 21] of: J.O. Hand &amp; M. Wolff, ''Early Netherlandish Painting'', National Gallery of Art, Washington catalogue (Cambridge UP), 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-34016-0}}; the correspondence concerning the appropriateness or not of ''modello'' applied by Michael Hirst to presentation drawings by [[Michelangelo]] that were "done expressly for patronal approval, criticism or rejection" (Hirst, ''Michelangelo and His Drawings'', 1988:79) is noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; The&lt;span id="Ricordo" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding heading-less link-target is linked to by [[Ricordi]] and [[Ricordo]] --&gt; less frequently found term '''ricordo''' (Italian for "record" or "memory") means a similar piece produced as a small copy ''after'' completion of the work as a record for the workshop.&lt;ref&gt;A small finished bronze representing a completed sculpture on a reduced scale, made for a [[connoisseur]] or the art market, is a ''reduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the ''ricordo'' for the [[prime version]] might serve in the atelier as the ''modello'' for the subsequent ones.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Brown, Richard G. Mann; ''Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue'', National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40107-0}}. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 last paragraph of p.73], the view is advanced that an [[El Greco]] was produced as a ''ricordo'' for the first version of a work, and then used as the ''modello'' for a second version.&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. 

The [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] at right was catalogued as a modello by [[Michael Levey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''The 17th and 18th century Italian Schools; National Gallery Catalogues'', p.223, 1971, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-901791-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent [[x-ray]] investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its [[underpainting]] it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the [[Courtauld Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Braham Helen, ''The Princes Gate Collection'', p. 74, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, {{ISBN|0-904563-04-9}} [http://www.courtauldprints.com/image.php?id=147902&amp;idx=1&amp;fromsearch=true Courtauld Institute image] – note this is reversed compared to the final painting.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886961 Francisco Bayeu. Saragossa; Review of Exhibition] by Xavier Bray, [[The Burlington Magazine]], Vol. 138, No. 1120 (Jul., 1996), p. 479, note 3. JSTOR – on free page&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery still describe it as "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6273 National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghiberticompetition.jpg|thumb|left|''Sacrifice of Isaac''; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s successful competition modello for the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Brunelleschi%20Filippo/imagepages/image2.html Brunelleschi's unsuccessful version]. Both are in the [[Bargello]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Cartoon", named for the sturdy ''cartone'' paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale,&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons for [[tapestry]] were always at full scale; often cut into loom-width strips, they were set behind the warps of the loom as a direct guide for the weavers. The most famous tapestry cartoons are the "[[Raphael Cartoons]]" conserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; they were re-used in the 17th century in England to produce series of [[Mortlake|Mortlake tapestries]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms ''cartoon'' and ''working drawing'' are often used interchangeably. ''Modello'' is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or [[watercolour]], or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term '''modeletto''' will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, ''modello'' may be printed in [[italic type|italic]]s, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, the word does not appear in the original ''[[OED]]'' or the First Supplement of 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the word, ''modèle'', may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.

Especially in the case of oil sketches, many ''modelli'' are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in "preparatory drawings" or "studies", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.

[[File:Passignano Michelangelo che da il modellino di San Pietro a Paolo IV.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] shows [[Pope Julius II]] his ''modellino'' of St Peter's in this 19th-century artist's impression]]
An example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Rosso Fiorentino]]: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, "un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo."&lt;ref&gt;"A most beautiful ''modello'' of all the works, which is today in our houses in Arezzo."&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary ''modello colorito'' in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of [[Illusionistic ceiling|illusionistic ''sotto-in-su'' perspectives]] on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as [[Andrea Pozzo]], the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (1700–17)&lt;ref&gt;In vol. II, section "Breve instruttione per dipingere a fresco", noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]]. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] won, beating six other artists, including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Jacopo della Quercia]]; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named ([[Bargello]] – picture above).

There are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including [[St Peter's, Rome]] and the "Great Model" of [[St Paul's Cathedral, London]], showing a different design by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] from that actually built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explore-stpauls.net/oct03/textMM/TriforumGreatModelN.htm Explore St Paul's – Wren's Great Model]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.

The depiction of '''night in paintings''' is common in [[Western art history|Western art]]. Paintings that feature a night scene as the [[theme (arts)|theme]] may be [[religious art|religious]] or [[history painting]]s, [[genre art|genre]] scenes, [[portrait]]s, [[landscape]]s, or other subject types. Some artworks involve religious or [[fantasy]] topics using the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. The source of illumination in a night scene—whether it is the moon or an [[artificial light]] source—may be depicted directly, or it may be implied by the character and coloration of the light that reflects from the subjects depicted.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Historical overview==
Beginning in the early [[Renaissance]], artists such as [[Giotto]], [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Uccello]] and others told stories with their painted works, sometimes evoking religious themes and sometimes depicting battles, myths, stories and scenes from history, using night-time as the setting. By the 16th and 17th centuries, painters of the late Renaissance, [[Mannerist]]s, and painters from the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] era including [[El Greco]], [[Titian]], [[Giorgione]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]] often portrayed people and scenes in night-time settings, illustrating stories and depictions of real life.

Eighteenth-century [[Rococo]] painters [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]], and others used the night-time theme to illustrate scenes of the imagination, often with dramatic literary connotations, including scenes of secret liaisons and romantic relationships reminiscent of the popular 1782 book ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], used the themes of nighttime to depict illustrations of ordinary life. Poet and painter [[William Blake]] and painter [[Henry Fuseli]] used the night-time in their work as the setting for many of their most imaginative visions. The most dramatic use of the night-time can be seen in the 1793 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]], called ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', portraying the French revolutionary leader [[Jean-Paul Marat]] after his murder by [[Charlotte Corday]].

The night in paintings of the 19th century was used to convey a complex of diverse meanings. A mystical, religious, and sublime reverence for nature is seen in [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church|Frederick Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and others, while the powerful and dramatic [[romanticism]] of [[Francisco Goya]], [[Théodore Géricault]], and [[Eugène Delacroix]] served as visual reportage of current events, and in the case of Géricault revealed a scandal. [[Gustave Courbet]], who with [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Jules Breton]], [[Jean-François Millet]], and others created the [[Realism (art)|Realist school]], portrayed ordinary people hard at work, traveling, or engrossed in their everyday lives, at night and during the day. The [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] of the late 19th century used the night-time theme to express a multitude of emotional and aesthetic insights seen most dramatically in the paintings of [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and others.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Natten, Bertel Thorvaldsen, A901.tif|thumb|''Night'', relief by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] depicting the personified night.]]
Black and grey shades often symbolize [[gloom]], [[fear]], mystery, [[superstitions]], [[evil]], death, [[secret]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The light source in most religious paintings symbolize [[hope]], guidance or [[divinity]].

In fantasy paintings light could symbolize magic, like the following lines of a poem entitled ''The Magic'': "There's magic in this night, enshrouded in this night, hidden, like a lamp in an old man's robe, there's MAGIC."&lt;ref name=Favorite&gt;Favorite, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

====Gaddi, ''The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds''====
One of the first attempts in depicting night in paintings was by [[Taddeo Gaddi]], an Italian painter and architect.&lt;ref name=Farquhar&gt;Farquhar, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Gaddi, fascinated by nocturnal lighting, depicted the effect of the light in ''The Angelic Announcement to the Shepherds'' night scene. The [[fresco]] at [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]] in Florence, Italy features an incandescent [[angel]] as it hovers over a [[shepherd]].&lt;ref name="Paoletti and Radke"/&gt;{{rp|91}} Against the night sky the brilliance of the angel's bright glow, likely intended as "verification of the presence of God and as a metaphor for [[spiritual enlightenment]]", appears to startle the shepherd. Gaddi's use of [[monochrome|monochromatic]] colors in and around the shepherd reveals how the colors are made pale due to the remarkable illumination.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177, 179}}{{#tag:ref|A student and godson of [[Giotto di Bondone]], Gaddi was influenced by Giotti's exploration away from traditional [[Medieval art]]istic works towards development of solid three-dimensional characters using contrasting dark and light shades to suggest depth and shape.

In the book of miniatures, Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the scene of ''Christ in Gethsemane'' is an apcolyptic one which foretells the death of Christ, through the presence of three comets in the evening sky.&lt;ref&gt;Scheckner, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano'' is one of a three painting series that captures the Battle of San Romano. The passage of time, from dawn to evening, is illustrated in the three paintings with the initial use of pale, pastel shades and increasingly darker tones as the battle progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84,90}}

====Geertgen, ''Nativity at Night''====
Influenced by a vision of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]'s ''[[Nativity at Night (Geertgen tot Sint Jans)|Nativity at Night]]'' depicts the infant Jesus who "radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle."&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, including quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Strengthening the message about the baby Jesus being the light source, Geertgen depicts the child as the only source of illumination for the main scene inside the stable. Aglow are the faces of the angels, St Joseph and Virgin Mary. Although the shepherds' fire on the hill behind and the angel outside the window create a light source, it's dim in comparison to that provided by the infant child. The sharp contrast of the divine light against dark is a tool used to make the scene appear more profound for its viewers.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}}&lt;ref name=LNG-Geertgen&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night ''The Nativity at Night''.] The National Gallery, London. Retrieved 27 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; London's National Gallery describes Geertgen's work as: "one of the most engaging and convincing early treatments of the Nativity as a night scene.&lt;ref name=LNG-Geertgen/&gt;

====''Annunciation to the Shepherds''====
In the still of the night, the only source of light radiates in ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' comes from an angel who has come to tell the shepherds of the birth of the infant Christ. The light is so brilliant that the Bethlehem shepherds must shield their eyes. Aside from the startling angel, the nocturnal painting is a pleasant, still pastoral scene with a group of angels in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=112303 ''The Annunciation to the Shepherds.''] J.

====Adam Elsheimer====
Early [[Baroque]] artist [[Adam Elsheimer]] created night scenes that were highly original. His works departed slightly {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} from other works of the Baroque period were dramatic and abundantly detailed.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque paintings featured "exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, release from restraint, and even a kind of artistic sensationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Martin, Rosenwein, and Smith (2010). ''The Making of the West'' (third ed.). Boston: Bedford/ St. Martin's. pp. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Elsheimer's lighting effects in general were very subtle, and very different from those of [[Caravaggio]]. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it. &lt;!--- any more info about his use of light / depiction of night? ---&gt;

====Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio====
[[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] was an Italian artist active between 1593 and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the [[Baroque]] [[Baroque painting|school of painting]].&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|298–299}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name.]&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio's novelty was a radical [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of [[chiaroscuro]]. This came to be known as [[Tenebrism]], the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|299}}&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gilles Lambert, "Caravaggio", p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---- any more info about the specifically cited paintings? ---&gt;

====Georges de La Tour====
[[Georges de La Tour]] was a French Baroque painter who painted mostly religious [[chiaroscuro]] scenes lit by candlelight, which were more developed than his artistic predecessors, yet lacked dramatic effects of Caravaggio. He created some of the most arresting works in this genre, portraying a wide range of scenes by candlelight from card games to New Testament narratives.&lt;ref name=Blunt&gt;Blunt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- focus more specifically on cited works ---&gt;

====Aert van der Neer====
The [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Aert van der Neer]] was a [[landscape painter]], specializing in small night scenes lit only by moonlight and fires, and snowy winter landscapes, both often looking down a canal or river.

====Anthony van Dyck====
[[Anthony van Dyck]] (22 March 1599&amp;nbsp;– 9 December 1641) was a [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque artist]] and leading [[court painter]] in England.

====Joseph Vernet====
[[Joseph Vernet|Claude-Joseph Vernet]] (14 August 1714&amp;nbsp;– 3 December 1789) was a French painter whose landscapes, including those of moonlights were popular with English aristocrats. His ''The Port of Rochefort'' (1763, Musée national de la Marine) is particularly notable; in the piece Vernet is able to achieve, according to art historian [[Michael Levey]], one of his most 'crystalline and atmospherically sensitive skies'.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Wright====
[[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (3 September 1734&amp;nbsp;– 29 August 1797) was an English landscape and portrait painter who is notable for his use of [[Chiaroscuro]] effect, which emphasises the contrast of light and dark, and for his paintings of candle-lit subjects. Wright is seen at his best in his candlelit subjects. The ''[[Borghese Gladiator|Three Gentlemen observing the 'Gladiator']]'' (1765). ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the sun. ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) shows people gathered round observing an early experiment into the nature of air and its ability to support life.

These factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the air pump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.&lt;ref name=Baird&gt;{{cite web | last = Baird | first = Olga | author2 = Malcolm Dick | title = Joseph Wright of Derby: Art, the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution | url = http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf | accessdate = 2007-11-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070316172422/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf | archivedate = 16 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atkinson Grimshaw====
[[File:Grimshaw-NightfallThames.jpg|thumb|[[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], ''Nightfall on the Thames'', 1880]]

[[Atkinson Grimshaw]] (6 September 1836&amp;nbsp;– 13 October 1893) was a Victorian-era artist&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Wood, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|173}} known for his city night-scenes and landscapes.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;Robertson, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyos&gt;[[H. J. Dyos]], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; His careful painting and skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His "paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene."&lt;ref&gt;Waller, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

''On Hampstead Hill'' is considered one of Grimshaw's finest works, exemplifying his skill with a variety of light sources, in capturing the mood of the passing of twilight into night. In his later career his urban scenes under twilight or yellow streetlighting were popular with his middle-class patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Steer.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}}

In the 1880s, Grimshaw maintained a London studio in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], not far from the studio of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. After visiting Grimshaw, Whistler remarked that "I considered myself the inventor of Nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures."&lt;ref name=Lambourne&gt;Lambourne, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}} Unlike Whistler's [[Impressionism|Impressionistic]] night scenes Grimshaw worked in a realistic vein: "sharply focused, almost photographic," his pictures innovated in applying the tradition of rural moonlight images to the Victorian city, recording "the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry."&lt;ref name=Lambourne/&gt;{{rp|112–113}}&lt;!--- probably still needs more editing, but leaving for the moment.---&gt;

====Petrus van Schendel====
[[Petrus van Schendel]] (1806–1870) was a Dutch Romantic painter,&lt;ref&gt;WG Flippo. (1981). Lexicon of the Belgian Romantic Painters, Antwerp.&lt;/ref&gt; etcher and draughtsman. Van Schendel specialised in nocturnal Dutch market scenes, exploring the effects the soft light had upon his subjects, as a result he was named '''Monsieur Chandelle''' by the French. Van Schendel was inspired by these famous forebears, but brought a unique nineteenth century mood to his night scenes. He eloquently captured the mysterious world of city markets illuminated by lamps and moonlight before the dawn.

====James Abbott McNeill Whistler====

[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] (11 July 1834&amp;nbsp;– 17 July 1903) was an American-born, British-based artist.&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"&gt;Anderson and Koval, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}}
&lt;!---- commented out for now, some of this may be relevant later
In Paris Whistler met [[Charles Baudelaire]] whose ideas and theories of "modern" art influenced Whistler. Baudelaire challenged artists to scrutinize the brutality of life and nature and to portray it faithfully, avoiding the old themes of mythology and allegory.&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|48}} [[Théophile Gautier]], one of the first to explore translational qualities among art and music, may have inspired Whistler to view art in musical terms.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;Peters, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}----&gt;

Whistler's ill-advised journey in 1866 to [[Valparaíso, Chile]],&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|141}} resulted in Whistler's first three nocturnal paintings—which he termed "moonlights" and later re-titled as "nocturnes"—night scenes of the harbor painted with a blue or light green palette. Later in London, he painted several more nocturnes over the next ten years, many of the [[River Thames]] and of [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]], a pleasure park famous for its frequent [[fireworks]] displays, which presented a novel challenge to paint. In his maritime nocturnes, Whistler used highly thinned paint as a ground with lightly flicked color to suggest ships, lights, and shore line.&lt;ref name="Gardner and Kleiner"/&gt;{{rp|368}}&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;Peters, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} Some of the Thames paintings also show compositional and thematic similarities with the Japanese prints of [[Hiroshige]].&lt;ref name="Anderson and Koval"/&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;!--- likely more ce opportunities, but will wait and see--&gt;

In 1877 Whistler sued the [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]''. Ruskin accused Whistler of "asking two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler won the suit, but was awarded one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] for damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/whistler/ Whistler, James Abbott McNeill]. WebMuseumn, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the case bankrupted him. It has been suggested [[John Ruskin]] suffered from [[CADASIL]] and the visual disturbances this condition caused him might have been a factor in his irritation at this particular painting.&lt;ref name="Kempster"&gt;Kempster PA, Alty JE.

===''The Night Watch'', Rembrandt van Rijn===
''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq'' by Dutch painter [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] is one of the most famous paintings in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} One of its key elements is the effective use of light and shadow ([[chiaroscuro]]).&lt;ref name=Boka&gt;Boka and Courteau, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61,65}} Made in 1642, it depicts the eponymous [[Schutterij|company]] moving out, led by Captain [[Frans Banning Cocq]] (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, [[Willem van Ruytenburch]] (dressed in yellow, with a white sash).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd, the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the small girl in the centre left background.&lt;ref name=Boka/&gt;{{rp|65}}

For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. The heavy varnish was only discovered in the 1940s and restoration began after 1975.&lt;ref name="Hagen and Hagen"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

===''The Third of May 1808'', Francisco Goya===

''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' by Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]] commemorates Spanish resistance to [[Napoleon]]'s armies during the occupation of 1808 in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|109}} The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, ''The Third of May 1808'' marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"&gt;Licht, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116–127}} According to the art historian [[Kenneth Clark]], ''The Third of May 1808'' is "the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130.}}

It is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprising&lt;ref name="Hagen and Hagen"/&gt;{{rp|363}} and centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]], the other a disorganized group of captives held at gun point. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, "by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target."&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{rp|127}}&lt;!--ref name was "rubens"--&gt; A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer.&lt;!----&lt;ref&gt;This is consistent with Murat's desire to choose as victims members of the lower classes and the clergy who organized them.&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boime, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|297}} The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of [[martyrdom]] in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of [[chiaroscuro]], and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|121}} However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by [[Jusepe de Ribera]], feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the "crown of martyrdom" for the victim.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|118}}

The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by [[Baroque]] artists, and perfected by [[Caravaggio]].&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|119}} Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in ''The Third of May'' the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the spiritual has been subverted.&lt;ref name="Licht-1979"/&gt;{{rp|119}}

===''The Starry Night'', Vincent van Gogh===
''[[The Starry Night]]'', made by Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], depicts his memory of the view outside his sanitorium room window at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]] (located in southern France) at night.&lt;ref name=Zara-2012&gt;Zara, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}} Although Van Gogh was not very happy with the painting,&lt;ref name=letter607&gt;Van Gogh, Vincent. (author). Harrison, Robert. (ed.) (19 September 1889) [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/607.htm ''Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written in Saint-Rémy. Translated by Mrs. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, number 607.''] Webexhibits.org Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; art historian Joachim Pissarro cites ''The Starry Night'' as an exemplar of the artist's fascination with the [[nocturnal]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol. (13 June 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/arts/design/13voge.html Nytimes.com ''Darkness Was Muse for a Master of Light.''] The New York Times. Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Van Gogh's most popular pieces, the painting is widely hailed as his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref name=Zara-2012/&gt;{{rp|225}}

===''Nighthawks'', Edward Hopper===
[[Edward Hopper]] had a lifelong interest in capturing the effect of light on the objects it touched, including the nighttime effect of artificial, man-made light spilling out of windows, doorways and porches. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' was probably Hopper's most ambitious essay in capturing the night-time effects of man-made light. For one thing, the diner's plate-glass windows cause significant light to spill out onto the sidewalk and the brownstones on the far side of the street. As well, interior light comes from more than a single lightbulb, with the result that multiple shadows are cast, and some spots are brighter than others as a consequence of being lit from more than one angle. Across the street, the line of shadow caused by the upper edge of the diner window is clearly visible towards the top of the painting.  These windows, and the ones below them as well, are partly lit by an unseen streetlight, which projects its own mix of light and shadow. As a final note, the bright interior light causes some of the surfaces within the diner to be reflective. This is clearest in the case of the right-hand edge of the rear window, which reflects a vertical yellow band of interior wall, but fainter reflections can also be made out, in the counter-top, of three of the diner's occupants. None of these reflections would be visible in daylight.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== ''The Empire of Light'', René Magritte ===
In his 1950 painting ''[[The Empire of Light]],'' [[René Magritte]] (1898–1967),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3692&amp;page_number=6&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMA collection]&lt;/ref&gt; explores the illusion of night and day, and the [[paradox]] of time and light. On the top half of his canvas Magritte paints a clear blue sky and white clouds that radiate bright daytime; while on the bottom half of his canvas below the sky, he paints a street, sidewalk, trees and houses all steeped in the darkness of night. The darkened trees and darkened houses appear to be in nighttime shadows, in the middle of the night; and the sidewalk streetlight is on to guide the way. Some of the questions implied by these pictures include is it night-time? is it daytime? or is it just a painting? ''The Empire of Light'' is one of a series of paintings that René Magritte painted between 1950 and 1954 that explores his surrealist insight into illusion and reality, using night and day as his subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Empire%20of%20Light&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=76.2553.102 Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3692&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1&amp;section_id=T053160#skipToContent MoMA biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In aesthetics, '''nimism''' is a particular kind of [[trope (literature)|trope]] or [[symbol]] characterized  by exaggeration.  
The term is derived from [[Latin]] (''nimis''), "too much" and (''nimietas''), ''excess''.  Unlike a [[hyperbole]] or [[paradox]], it is not applied to linguistic or rhetorical phenomena only, but usually refers to other forms of disparity, e.g. disproportions in sculptures and paintings, or certain sorts of discrepancies in appearance or behaviour (in theatre plays, movies etc.).
Thus nimism, by means of symbolic parallels or analogies, is meant to help the reader, viewer etc. to see the truth. A ''negative nimism'' hints at something bad (a weakness, vice, sin, crime etc.), the less frequently used ''positive nimism'' indicates something good (a virtue or something heroic).

==Examples==

*King Duncan’s cloak, too wide for his murderous successor Macbeth. (Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth]]'')
*The feet of the two naughty  stepsisters, too big (and bloody) to fit Cinderella’s tiny shoe, hence an obvious evidence of their wrong claim. (Brothers Grimm's "[[Cinderella|Cinderella and The Little Glass Slipper]]" )
*Elizabeth Bennet’s look at the nude male sculptures in Darcy’s art gallery, cast much too long to conceal her sexual awakening. (Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')
*The proverbial “Qui s’excuse s’accuse” ("[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qui%20s'excuse%20s'accuse He who excuses himself accuses himself]") referring to an apology offered too early, i.e., untimely and not asked for, and thus revealing a bad conscience.

'''Opera management''' is the management of the processes by which [[opera]] is delivered to audiences. A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also managing the [[opera house]] in which the company performs. 

Opera is a complex art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations—keeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building—combined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Towse, Ruth (2011).  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eyXQbYAXCBQC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MW7ZT8myMIrE0QX62-n8Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "Opera and Ballet"], p. 313 in Ruth Towse (ed.) ''A Handbook of Cultural Economics''. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1848448872}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual [[impresario]]s rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as "a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions".&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader'' (6 August 1864). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?pg=PA175&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;ei=GULbT8PqK82r8AO-zK3JCw&amp;id=ToBNAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "The Opera Season at Covent Garden"], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Gye]], who turned the [[Royal Italian Opera]] in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a "dreadful business".&lt;ref&gt;Dideriksen, Gabriella and Ringel, Matthew (1995). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/746717 "Frederick Gye and 'The Dreadful Business of Opera Management'"], ''19th-Century Music'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (Summer, 1995), pp. 3-30. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venice and the development of opera as a business==
The [[origins of opera|earliest operas]] were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was [[Marco da Gagliano]]'s ''[[La Flora]]'',  performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of [[Margherita de' Medici]] and  [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma]]. [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena]], the wife of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II de' Medici]] and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harness, Kelley Ann (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfj1sn6m_XoC&amp;q=%22La+Flora%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22La%20Flora%22&amp;f=false ''Echoes of Women's Voices: Music, Art, and Female Patronage in Early Modern Florence''], p. 175. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226316599}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Publicly performed operas first appeared in [[Venice]] during the [[Carnival|Carnival season]] of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the [[Grimani]], [[Nicolò Tron|Tron]],  and [[Vendramin]]. The rebuilt [[Teatro San Cassiano]], sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of ''L'Andromeda'' in 1637 by librettist [[Benedetto Ferrari]] and composer [[Francesco Manelli]] marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark (2006). ''Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi'', pp. 130-131. Amadeus Press. {{ISBN|1574671103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of cases the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Venetian owners  profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The ''cassier'' (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the ''cassier'' was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the ''cassier''.&lt;ref&gt;Glixon, Beth Lise and Glixon, Jonathan Emmanuel (2006). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nP5zEo5K7a8C&amp;q=managers#v=snippet&amp;q=managers&amp;f=false ''Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice''], p. 4.

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

A '''regents group portrait''', '''regentenstuk''' or '''regentessenstuk''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "regents' piece", is a [[Portrait painting|group portrait]] of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a [[charitable organization]] or [[guild]].  This type of group portrait was popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] during the 17th century, and in the 18th century.  They were intended to be hung in the ''regentenkamer'', the regents' meeting room,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/media/medialibrary/2013/04/Informatiepakket_Frans_Hals_2013.pdf "Informatiepakket Frans Hals", Frans Hals Museum] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; or another prominent location in the institution.

The regents of a charitable organization (such as an [[orphanage]], [[poorhouse]], [[hospital]] or ''[[hofje]]'')  or guild were drawn from the ''[[regenten]]'', the upper class of Dutch society. It was a prestigious honorary office, so the regents were keen to have themselves depicted in this role. The leading portraitists of the day were commissioned to make ''regentenstukken'', including [[Rembrandt]] (whose ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table), [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], and [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. The commissions proved lucrative, particularly since the regents only served for a few years, to be replaced with a new set of regents that were equally eager to be painted.
[[File:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]] in [[Haarlem]], [[Frans Hals]], 1664]]

In some institutions the regentesses were all female, and so the portraits were of all-female groups, or there were mixed-gender regents who were painted separately, as in Hals' two portraits of the ''[[Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse|Regents]]'' and ''[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]]''.  Occasionally the painting depicted not just the regents but also others, such as the ''binnenvader'' or ''binnenmoeder'', who was in charge of the day-to-day operations. For instance, [[Abraham de Vries (painter)|Abraham de Vries]] in 1633 painted a ''regentenstuk'' for the ''Burgerweeshuis'' orphanage in [[Amsterdam]] showing not only the regents but also the ''binnenvader'' leading in a young orphan girl.

Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the [[militia group portrait]] or ''schuttersstuk'' showing officers of a city's ''[[schutterij]]'' or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the 17th century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Boards of trustees preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.  Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. 

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. 

In Amsterdam most of these paintings ultimately ended up in possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdam Museum]].

'''Religious art''' or '''sacred art''' is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual. Sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist's religious tradition.

==Christian art==

{{see also|Religious image#Christianity|Madonna (art)|Icon|Images of Jesus}}

Christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of [[Christianity]], though other definitions are possible.It is to make imagery of the different beliefs in the world and what it looks like.Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity. Most Christian art is allusive, or built around [[theme (literary)|theme]]s familiar to the intended observer. One of the most common Christian themes is that of the Virgin Mary holding the [[Child Jesus|infant Jesus]]. Another is that of [[Christ]] on the [[Cross]]. For the benefit of the illiterate, an elaborate [[iconographic]] system developed to conclusively identify scenes. For example, [[Saint Agnes]] depicted with a lamb, [[Saint Peter]] with keys, [[Saint Patrick]] with a shamrock. Each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art.

===History===
[[Image:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|left|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest surviving Christian paintings are from the site at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], dated to around the year 70, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

[[Image:Sandro Botticelli 061.jpg|110 px|thumb|right|An example of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], commissioned by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Renaissance]].]]

The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] painted the [[Sistine Chapel]] and carved the famous ''[[Pietà]]'', [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] created the massive columns in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] painted the ''[[Last Supper]]''. The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, secular artists occasionally treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]). Only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]). However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a social interpretation of Christianity, [[Fritz von Uhde]] also revived the interest in sacred art, though the depiction of Jesus in ordinary places in life.

Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

The last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in Christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith, Christ, God, the Church, the Bible and other classic Christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world. Artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]], Gary P. Bergel, Carlos Cazares, Bruce Herman, Deborah Sokolove, and [[John August Swanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | title=Contemporary Religious Art | publisher=Mozaico | date=21 May 2015 | accessdate=2 June 2015 | author=Buenconsejo, Clara | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929011640/http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | archivedate=29 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist art==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
{{main|Buddhist art}}
Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of [[Islam]] alongside [[Hinduism]].

===Tibetan Buddhist art===
Most Tibetan Buddhist artforms are related to the practice of [[Vajrayana]] or Buddhist tantra.
[[Tibetan art]] includes [[thangka]]s and [[mandala]]s, often including depictions of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s. Creation of Buddhist art is usually done as a [[meditation]] as well as creating an object as aid to meditation. An example of this is the creation of a [[sand mandala]] by monks; before and after the construction prayers are recited, and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings (palace) of a Buddha on which is meditated to train the mind. The work is rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects, such as the [[vajra]] and the [[phurba]].

===Indian Buddhist art===
Two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of Buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century AD. One is Ajanta, a site in India long forgotten until discovered in 1817. The other is Dunhuang, one of the great oasis staging posts on the Silk Road...The paintings range from calm devotional images of the Buddha to lively and crowded scenes, often featuring the seductively full-breasted and narrow-waisted women more familiar in Indian sculpture than in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?gtrack=pthc&amp;ParagraphID=bdc#bdc |title=History Of Buddhism |publisher=Historyworld.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major art included mosques and a madonna (art of Mary and possibly her child)

==Islamic  art==
{{main|Islamic art}}
A prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art, as well as the naturally decorative nature of Arabic script, led to the use of calligraphic decorations, which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns and vegetal forms ([[arabesque]]s) that expressed ideals of order and nature. These were used on religious architecture, carpets, and handwritten documents.&lt;ref name="huntfor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218232141/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-date=2004-02-18 |dead-url=yes |title=Islamic Art - Islamic Art of Calligraphy and Arabesque |accessdate=2014-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view. It focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form.

While there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through Islamic history, this is a distinctly modern [[Sunni]] view. [[Persian miniature]]s, along with medieval [[depictions of Muhammad]] and [[angels in Islam]], stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern Sunni tradition. Also, [[Shi'a]] Muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures, including the Prophet's as long as the depiction is respectful.

===Figure representation===
The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God, and it is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial. The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the [[Hadith]] (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms," or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. [[Iconoclasm]] was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As with other forms of Islamic ornamentation, artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms, giving rise to a great variety of figural-based designs.

===Arabesque===
{{main|Arabesque}}

{{empty section|date=October 2018}}

===Calligraphy===
{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphy is a highly regarded element of Islamic art. The [[Qur'an]] was transmitted in Arabic, and inherent within the Arabic script is the potential for ornamental forms. The employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying [[talisman]]ic component. While most works of art had legible inscriptions, not all Muslims would have been able to read them. One should always keep in mind, however, that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text, albeit in a decorative form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cali/hd_cali.htm |title=Calligraphy in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century AD, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of Islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art. The main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles, called generally the [[Kufic]], and the soft cursive styles, which include [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]], [[Thuluth]], [[Nastaliq]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|many others]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |title=Art of Arabic Calligraphy |publisher=Sakkal |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
{{main|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric patterns make up one of the three nonfigural types of decoration in Islamic art. Whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation, geometric patterns are popularly associated with Islamic art, largely due to their aniconic quality. These abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental Islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17185">[[File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Richard Tuttle]], ''Red Canvas,'' 1967, [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]], USA) ]]

'''Shaped canvases''' are [[painting]]s that depart from the normal flat, rectangular configuration. [[Canvas]]es may be shaped by altering their outline, while retaining their flatness. An ancient, traditional example is the ''[[Tondo (art)|tondo]]'', a painting on a round panel or canvas: [[Raphael]], as well as some other Renaissance painters, sometimes chose this format for [[Madonna (art)|madonna]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistory.about.com/od/renaissanceart/l/bl_debrecy_tondo.htm Arthistory.about.com] page on Raphael's "de Brécy" tondo canvas painting&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, canvases may be altered by losing their flatness and assuming a three-dimensional surface. Or, they can do both. That is, they can assume shapes other than rectangles, and also have surface features that are three-dimensional. Arguably, changing the surface configuration of the painting transforms it into a sculpture. But shaped canvases are generally considered paintings.

Apart from any aesthetic considerations, there are technical matters, having to do with the very nature of canvas as a material, that tend to support the flat rectangle as the norm for paintings on canvas. (See [[#Departing from the rectangular|Departing from the rectangular]] below.)

In the literature of art history and criticism, the term ''shaped canvas'' is particularly associated with certain works created mostly in New York after about 1960, during a period when a great variety and quantity of such works were produced. According to the commentary at a [[Rutgers University]] exhibition site, "... the first significant art historical attention paid to shaped canvases occurred in the 1960s...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zamweb.rutgers.edu/exhibitions/?id=41 Image of a 1935 Abraham Joel Tobias shaped-canvas painting at the Zimmerli Art Museum] ([[Rutgers University]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pioneers of modern shaped-canvas painting ==
Abraham Joel Tobias made "shaped canvases" in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, Jeffrey;  Abraham Joel Tobias;  Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum.;  Queens Museum.

Paintings exhibited by the [[New Orleans]] born abstract painter [[Edward Clark (artist)|Edward Clark]] shown at New York's [[Tenth Street galleries#Brata Gallery|Brata Gallery]] in 1957 have also been termed shaped canvas paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/edward-clark-41|title=Edward Clark – The HistoryMakers|work=thehistorymakers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2230 Metro Times Book review of ''Edward Clark: For the Sake of the Search'' in the Detroit Metro Times], stating that Clark is "widely credited with making the first extended shape painting (continuing the painting out of its rectangular frame with paper and wood) in 1956. "It wasn't called a shape painting then, just something strange and different that began with that painting," Clark said. The untitled work was shown in 1957 at the Brata Gallery..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the late 1950s through the mid-1960s [[Jasper Johns]] experimented with shaped and compartmentalized canvases, notably with his '[[American Flag]] [[Painting]]' – one canvas placed on top of another, larger canvas. [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s experimental [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] and "combines" of the 1950s also explored variations of divided and shaped canvas. Argentine artist [[Lucio Fontana]] also began early on the experiment in shaped and compartmentalized canvases with his Concetto Spaziale, Attese series in 1959. Assigning a date to the origin of the postwar shaped canvas painting may not be possible&lt;!-- see this article's discussion page--&gt;, but certainly it had emerged by the late 1950s.

== Postwar modern art and the shaped canvas ==
Frances Colpitt ("The Shape of Painting in the 1960s"; ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]'', Spring 1991) states flatly that "the shaped canvas was the dominant form of abstract painting in the 1960s". She writes that the shaped canvas, "although frequently described as a hybrid of painting and sculpture, grew out of the issues of abstract painting and was evidence of the desire of painters to move into real space by rejecting behind-the-frame illusionism." .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/777086 ''The Shape of Paintings in the 1960s''] Retrieved June 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Charles Hinman]] [[Ronald Davis]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Leo Valledor]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[John Levee]], David Novros, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Gary Stephan]], Paul Mogenson, [[Clark Murray]], and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[hard-edge]] painters may, for example, elect to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. There is a connection here with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacts against the [[abstract expressionist]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as their solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting.
While the shaped canvas first challenged the formalized rectangular shape of paintings, it soon questioned the constraints of two-dimensionality. According to [[Donald Judd]] in his ''Complete Writings'': 'The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself: it is obviously the whole shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judd|first1=Donald|title=Complete Writings 1959–1975|date=1975|publisher=Halifax: Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design|pages=181-182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the Solomun R. [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] organised the definitive exhibition 'The Shaped Canvas" curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. [[Lucy Lippard]] noted that this show focused exclusively on paintings with a "one -sided continuous surface"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=James|title=Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10590-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3EYlwvRzvwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Frank Stella]] and Frank Geldzahler confronted this definition of the shaped canvas by introducing three-dimensional shaped canvases by artists [[Charles Hinman]] and [[Will Insley]] in their seminal group show "Shape and Structure" at Tibor de Naguy in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, Meyer&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the third dimension by paintings was an important development of the shaped canvas as it questioned the frontier between painting and sculpture.

The apertured, superimposed, multiple canvases of [[Jane Frank]] in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case: while generally flat and rectangular, they are rendered sculptural by the presence of large, irregularly shaped holes in the forward canvas or canvases, through which one or more additional painted canvases can be seen. A student of [[Hans Hofmann]], and sharing his concern for pictorial depth as well as his reverence for nature, she also favors colors, textures, and shapes that are complex, nuanced, and organic or earthen – giving her work a brooding or introspective quality that further sets it apart from that of many other shaped-canvas painters.

In the late 1960s, [[Trevor Bell (artist)|Trevor Bell]], a leading member of the British [[St. Ives group]] introduced dynamic shaped-canvas paintings that combined radical, angular structures with an [[abstract expressionist]] sensibility. These works continued to evolve into the 1970s as Bell's works were exhibited in the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]] and The [[Tate]] Gallery in [[London]]. The artist’s highly chromatic, [[color field]] surfaces on massive canvases merged shaped painting and the subsequent blank space surrounding the object into a state of equal importance. The Italian artist [[Luigi Malice]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbera, Lucio, ''[[:it:Luigi Malice|Luigi Malice]]: Percorsi della memoria 1959–1999'', Roma: Gangemi Editore, 1999 {{ISBN|88-7448-906-4}} [http://www.gangemieditore.com/scheda_articolo.php?id_prodotto=2914&amp;id_autore=1011]&lt;/ref&gt; also experimented with shaped canvases in the late 1960s.

[[Pop art]]ists such as [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[James Rosenquist]] also took up the shaped canvas medium. Robin Landa writes that "Wesselmann uses the shape of the container [by which Landa means the canvas] to express the organic quality of smoke" in his "smoker" paintings.&lt;ref name="Landa"&gt;Landa, Robin. ''An Introduction to Design'', Inglewood: Prentis Hall, 1983 {{ISBN|0-13-480624-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colpitt, however, the use of the shaped canvas by 1960s pop artists was considered at the time to be something other than shaped canvas painting properly speaking: "At the same time, not all reliefs qualified as shaped canvases, which, as an ideological pursuit in the sixties, tended to exclude Pop art." (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;52)

== More recent shaped canvas art ==
Among shaped-canvas artists of more recent generations, [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]] (1940–2007) produced playfully "exploding" canvases, in which exuberance of shape and color seems to force itself outside the normative rectangle – or, as a 1981 ''New York Times'' review put it: "...the inner shapes blast off from their moorings and cause the whole painting to fly apart." &lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DB1738F93BA35756C0A967948260  NY Times review: "Art: Exploding Canvases of Elizabeth Murray"], May 8, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's [[Anthony Poon]] (1945–2006) continued the tradition of cool, abstract, minimalist geometry associated with the shaped canvas in the 1960s. The analytical poise and undulating repetitions in his work somewhat recall the work of [[modular constructivist]] sculptors such as [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]].

The Filipino artist [[Pacita Abad]] (1946–2004) stuffed and stitched her painted canvases for a three-dimensional effect, combining this technique (which she called ''[[trapunto]]'', after a kind of [[quilt]]ing technique) with free-wheeling [[mixed media]] effects, riotous color, and abstract patterning suggestive of festive homemade textiles, or of party trappings such as streamers, balloons, or confetti. The total effect is joyously extrovert and warm – quite opposed to both the minimalist and pop art versions of "cool".

In reference to the shaped paintings of [[Jack Reilly (artist)|Jack Reilly]] (born 1950), Robin Landa emphasizes the power of the shaped canvas to create a sensation of movement: "Many contemporary artists feel that the arena of painting can be greatly extended by the use of shaped canvases. Movement is established in the container (canvas) itself as well as in the internal space of the container."&lt;ref name="Landa" /&gt; A 1981 review in ''Artweek'' stated "These intricately constructed pieces are related to wall sculpture, bridging the gap between painting and sculpture, they have an illusionary sculptural presence."&lt;ref name="Artweek"&gt;Jaconson, Linda. ''Two Dimensional Reliefs'', Artweek, Vol.12, Nov 21, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional function of the shaped canvas in Reilly's earlier work was to emphasize the ambiguity of pictorial space in [[abstract art]].

The Argentine artist Ladislao Pablo Győri (born 1963) became interested in non-representative and rigorous geometry formulations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpgyori.net/ lpgyori.net Győri's ''digital works, art and poetry, 1984/2003, Madí Paintings-Relief'']&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the paintings of the aforementioned Rhod Rothfuss led him to work in the realization of Madí Turning Paintings-Relief (irregular frame) and 3D digital animations of those geometric structures. [[Gyula Kosice]] (sculptor, poet, theorist, and one of the founders of the Argentine avant-garde of the 1940s) wrote: "He has rationally computerized the primordial ideas of Madi Art... I am convinced that his works radiate an undeniable quality and originality."&lt;ref name="f25vy"&gt;Győri, Ladislao Pablo. ''First 25 Visual Years'', ARTgentina, 2010, p. 29, {{ISBN|978-987-05-8040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-rectangular paintings==
Artists have often departed from the norm, especially in circumstances requiring special commissions, an example being the paintings [[Henri Matisse]] created for [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html Barnes mural] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720033955/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html |date=2011-07-20 }}. Accessed August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Nelson Rockefeller]].

In certain instances shaped canvas paintings can be seen as painting in relationship to sculpture and to wall relief. During the early to mid-1960s many young painters born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s made the transition from painting flat rectangles to painting shaped canvases; some of those artists decided to make sculpture and some artists like [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]] did both. Other materials can be used in place of canvas. More viable materials might obviate some of the drawbacks of shaped canvas.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Bannon (2011) "Re-envisioning nature: The role of aesthetics in environmental ethics," ''[http://www.cep.unt.edu/enethics.html Environmental Ethics]'' 33(4): 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, R. (2008) Andy Goldsworthy: Nature's collaborator, art's alchemist," ''[http://www.queensu.ca/quarterly/ Queen's Quarterly]'' 114(4): 597-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Opp, J. (2011) "Public history and the fragments of place: Archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta," ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rrhi20/current Rethinking History]'' 15: 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: [[Shinto]] has its [[Kami]] which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Principalities|Principalities]], [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Bonpo]] traditions.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

A '''talent manager''' (also known as an '''artist manager''', '''band manager''' or '''music manager''') is an individual or company who guides the professional career of [[entertainer|artists]] in the [[entertainment industry]]. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day [[business]] affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

The roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise [[actor]]s, [[writer]]s, or [[film director|director]]s. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent.&lt;ref name="breakingintrodummies"&gt;Garrison, Larry. ''Breaking Into Acting for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing Inc., 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talent agent]]s have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.

==History==
{{See also|Category:Talent agents}}
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Modern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business.{{cn|date=February 2015}} Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of [[The Beatles]] and [[Herman's Hermits]] in the 1960s such as [[Brian Epstein]], [[Allan Williams]], [[Harvey Lisberg]]. Infamous examples in the music press include [[Allen Klein]], manager of both The Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=July 6, 2009 | title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of talent agents deemed notable by [[wp:GNG|Wikipedia's general notability guidelines]], see [[:Category:Talent agents]]. For notable agencies and businesses, see [[:Category:Talent agencies]].

The industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the [[Association of Talent Agents]], which was formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1937. The ATA comes out of the [[Wagner Act]] upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], and [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentassociation.com/ Association of Talent Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music managers==&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
A music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for [[Musical ensemble|bands]], [[singers]], and [[DJ]]s. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager  may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth.  The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, [[business manager]] (who are usually [[certified public accountants]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a [[personal assistant]].  

Manager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so.  Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract.  That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a [[contract]] and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared.  

Responsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. 

A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, [[songwriter]]s, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding [[Record producer|music producers]], and developing relationships with [[Record company|record companies]], publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract.  

The duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

Among all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly.  

Early on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and [[marketing]] fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal [[contract]]. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.

==Management strategies==
Despite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Booking gigs===
Among the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster.&lt;ref&gt;Farrish, Bryan. Gig Booking 101 – Venue Relationships. Bryan Farrish Radio Promotion: Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, June 11, 2010, A Booking Strategy that Works! The DIY Musician (2010): Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet strategies===
As technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases.{{cn|date=February 2015}} “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Don and Dan Kimpel. “Chapter 6: The Manager.” In It All Begins With The Music. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Beatport]], [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[YouTube]] have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bryan. Music Marketing with Social Media in Only 30 Minutes a Day. The DIY Musician (2012): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as [[LinkedIn]] or [[Google+]], while networking on behalf of a client.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Not everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Wes. Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media. Hypebot.com (2013): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital case Study: Lady Gaga===
In an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, [[Jamie Anderson (scientist)|Jamie Anderson]] and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of [[Lady Gaga]]. [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]] of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. 

They set up many interviews with [[Bloggers|online bloggers]], established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusives]], [[interviews]] and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and [[Lady Gaga]]’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: [[Emotions]], [[Experiences]], [[:wikt:engage|Engaging]], and [[:wikt:exclusive|Exclusive]]. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, [[Lady Gaga]] was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich. Case Study: Making Money From Music. The Financial Times LTD (2011): Accessed March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
Striking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapositiveradio.com/general/dir/band_manager Band Manager Info at Media Positive Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Managers usually secure the services of a professional [[photographer]] while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, [[compact disc|CD]] labels/jackets, posters, and the [[press kit]]. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD.  Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production.  Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.

In art, theme is usually about [[life]], [[society]] or [[human nature]], but can be any other subject. Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work. Themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated. Deep thematic content is not required in a work, but the great majority of works have some kind of thematic content, not always [[Authorial intentionality|intended by the author]]. Analysis of changes (or implied change) in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme.

A theme is not the same as the subject of a work. For example, the ''subject'' of ''[[Star Wars]]'' is "the battle for control of the galaxy between the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Rebel Alliance]]". The ''themes'' explored in the films might be "moral ambiguity" or "the conflict between technology and nature".

Themes differ from [[motif (visual arts)|motifs in the visual arts]] in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole, while motifs are elements of the content.  In the same way, a literary story with repeated symbolism related to chess does not make the story's theme the similarity of life to chess. Themes arise from the interplay of the plot, the characters, and the attitude the author takes to them, and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12071">'''Tingatinga''' (also spelt '''Tinga-tinga''' or '''Tinga Tinga''') is a painting style that developed in the second half of the 20th century in the [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]] area in [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]) and later spread to most East Africa. Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, [[Kenya]] and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter [[Edward Said Tingatinga]].
[[File:Tingatinga school paintings.JPG|thumb|The Tingatinga school of painting sold their work in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam. Picture from 1973]]

Tingatinga is traditionally made on [[masonite]], using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the [[Big Five Game|big five]] and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of "[[airport painting]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-112811/exploring-tingatinga-art-movement-tanzania Exploring the Tingatinga Art Movement in Tanzania]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings themselves can be described as both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[caricature|caricatural]], and [[humor]] and [[sarcasm]] are often explicit.

==History==
Edward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Tanzania]] (Dar es Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_art.html |title=Tinga Tinga art |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed low cost materials such as [[masonite]] and [[bicycle paint]] and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[surrealism|surrealistic]] style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the "Tingatinga school".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm The tingatinga school of painting]. This is an informal term (i.e., those who paint after Tingatinga's example) and not to be confused with the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, which is a specific organization, although sometimes also referred to as a "school".  {{cite web |url=http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917035235/http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]). One of the most well known second-generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, [[Simon Mpata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm Tingatinga first students]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507131843/http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm |date=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought-after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like ''The lion'', ''Peacock on the Baobab Tree'', ''Antelope'', ''Leopard'', ''Buffalo'', or ''Monkey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |title=Are Tingatinga fakes a problem today? |publisher=Alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314042953/http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com/ |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:wall painting ngapa1.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], the village of E.S.Tingatinga's father]]
[[File:wall painting ngapa3.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in Ngapa depict animals in a [[naive art|naïve style]] that might resemble Tingatinga art]]

It is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper ''Tingatinga and His Followers'', [[Sweden|Swedish]] critic Berit Sahlström claimed that Tingatinga was of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] paintings that were sold in [[Dar es Salaam]] at his times.&lt;ref&gt;"Art in Tanzania 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this claim could be some articles by Merit Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards.

The claim by Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] wall decorations of [[Makua people|Makua]] and [[Makonde people]]. These paintings were first witnessed by [[Karl Heule]] in 1906 and described in his book ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Weule (1908), ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika'', Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Jesper Kirknaes]] and Japanese painting curator [[Kenji Shiraishi]], as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today.

Jesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shiraishi, ''Commentary to Tingatinga II''; article: ''Tinga TingaContemporary African Art and Mural''; ''Tingatinga: Afurikan poppu-ato no sekai'' / Kenji Shiraishi and Fumiko Yamamoto. Tokyo: Kodansha, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Thorup and Chitra Sundaram (2010), ''Tingatinga, Kitsch or Art'', p. 22; article: ''Off the walls to Hard Board and Canvas; What inspired Tingatinga?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Further elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls painting and traditional [[rock art|rock paintings]], an art form that in Africa has continued past [[stone age]] to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the "longest artist trend ever".&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shirashi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos'', Africa Hoy, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tingatinga Cooperative Society==
After Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, [[Simon Mpata]], and Omari Amonde &lt;ref&gt;Mwasanga, National Arts Council, Mture Publishers, Tingatinga, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the "Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway.&lt;ref&gt;Abdellahamani Hasani&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to '''Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society''' (TACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_cooperative.html |title=Tingatinga Co-operative Society |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the TACS is usually recognized as the most authoritative representative of the Tingatinga heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SomaliPress.com |url=http://www.somalipress.com/guides/culture/tanzania-tingatinga-arts-achievement.html |title=Tingatinga Arts Achievement |publisher=Somalipress.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a small fraction of Tingatinga artists are directly linked to this society.

The Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website on May 2018: [Http://Www.tingatingaArt.com www.tingatingaArt.com]

==Tingatinga and George Lilanga==

Although the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist [[George Lilanga]] was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lilanga| first = George| title = Colors of Africa| year = 2007| isbn = 978-88-89298-32-9| page = 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''George Lilanga'', Kamphausen&lt;/ref&gt; This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of [[enamel paint]] and square [[hardboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See K. Shiraishi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy'', p. 7. The book reports Lilanga's words as follow: ''It was entirely my own idea to incorporate this style. Nobody suggest I do it. In the Tingatinga style, I use enamel paint on hardboard. This board is excellent for achieving vivid color."&lt;/ref&gt; Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Masceloni, ''Catalogue Raisonne, George Lilanga'', p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] style, that shares the same [[horror vacui]] of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Thorup| first1 = Tine| last2 = Sam| first2 = Cuong| title = Tingatinga Kitch Or Quality Bicycle Enamel on Board &amp; Canvas| year = 2011| isbn = 978-87-992635-2-3| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as [[Noel Kapanda]] and later [[Mchimbi Halfani]], who collaborated with him.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.lilanga.org Lilanga.org] and [http://www.makonde-carvings.info Makonde Carvings] websites&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.&lt;ref&gt;K.

A [[locomotive]] or [[train]] can play many roles in art, for example:

* As a subject for a [[:Category:Rail transport in fiction|novel]] or [[:Category:Rail transport films|film]]
* As a [[metaphor]] in song or poetry, particularly for [[Power (physics)|physical power]] or directed movement (physical, ''romantic'' or other), as in ''[[Fisherman's Blues]]'':&lt;!--This should be short enough to qualify as fair use --&gt;

[[File:William Michael Harnett Still life Violin and Music.jpg|thumb|''Still life Violin and Music'' by [[William Michael Harnett]] ]]

'''''Trompe-l'œil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tʁɔ̃p lœj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70]]
[[File:Colyer, Edwaert - Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Trompe-l'œil painting by [[Evert Collier]]]]
[[File:Escaping criticism-by pere borrel del caso.png|thumb|''Escaping Criticism'' by [[Pere Borrell del Caso]], 1874]]

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'œil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) and [[Melozzo da Forlì]] (1438–1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sù|di sotto in sù]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489–1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460–1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'œil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting.  Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'œil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'œil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence – An Interview with Cinematographer István Borbás|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'œil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'œil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].

'''Uptown Oakland''' or '''The Uptown''' is a neighborhood in  [[Downtown Oakland|Downtown]] [[Oakland, California]].  Its boundaries are ill-defined, but most definitions include the area between 27th Street to the north, [[San Pablo Avenue]] to the west, [[Oakland City Center|City Center]] to the south, and Harrison St to the east.  The neighborhood has become an important [[entertainment district]] in recent years.&lt;ref name=sfbtpost&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2011/11/25/moving-ahead-in-oakland-post-occupy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area near 20th Street and Broadway had been Oakland's main [[shopping district]] in the mid-20th century. Several buildings from that era remain, including the [[Capwell's]] department store, which later became [[Sears]] and is currently being developed into a mixed-use retail and office building called "Uptown Station;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/19/downtown-oaklands-uber-building-is-bought-by-cim-group-rehab-will-continue/|title=Downtown Oakland’s Uber building is bought by CIM Group, rehab will continue|date=2017-12-19|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[I. Magnin]] department store; the [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]]; and the [[Fox Oakland Theatre]]. The Payless Drug Store and Market located at Telegraph Ave. and 20th St, housed the drug store small produce markets and seafood sellers. It included a SAAG's sausage counter and even a USO branch.
This structure was demolished in the early 1960s to construct a parking structure for Capwell's Department store. The area was home to one of the original [[Kwik Way]] hamburger outlets and also at Broadway and Grand Ave the Oakland branch of Breuners furniture.

West of [[Telegraph Avenue]], the neighborhood was for many years largely made up of [[parking lot]]s and garages. The area has gone through several failed [[urban renewal]] projects and proposals, including proposals for a shopping mall, an entertainment district, high-rise housing, and a professional baseball stadium. The area now contains several attractive high-rise apartment buildings.

==Development==
During [[Jerry Brown]]'s time as Mayor (1999-2007) The Uptown District was deemed the Entertainment center of the city.  Redevelopment has taken place by large upscale apartments and restaurants, bringing some much needed money and foot traffic into the area. The centerpiece has been the city government's 10K program, an effort to bring 10,000 additional residents to the downtown area. The largest of the new apartment complexes is a five-story, three-building apartment complex called "The Uptown"&lt;ref name=uptown&gt;http://www.theuptown.net/&lt;/ref&gt; built by [[Forest City Enterprises]], including a new dog-friendly park called Fox Square.  A new surface street, '''Rashida Muhammad Street''', was named after the late community activist who died of lung cancer in 2006. [[Alice Walker]] immortalized Rashida Muhammad's (aka Dessie X. Woods) story in her collection of essays ''Living by the Word''.  The street was built with the stated goal of The Uptown project of enhancing and building a new community in the area.  This complex also features the "Remember Them" sculpture by [[Mario Chiodo]], a local artist.&lt;ref name=remember&gt;http://remember-them.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture, when it is complete, will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Jones. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-01-02/news/17466236_1_monument-oakland-metropolitan-chamber-sculptures "Oakland to honor 25 leaders in huge sculpture"]. ''San Francisco Chronicle''. January 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 25 humanitarians honored in this sculpture include [[Oskar Schindler]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Ruby Bridges]], [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Thích Nhất Hạnh|Thich Nhat Hanh]], and [[Mother Teresa]].

Numerous bars and restaurants have opened between 16th Street and Grand Avenue. Retail continues to add to the landscape of the Uptown District.

In addition to becoming a nightlife destination for East Bay residents, the area has developed well culturally overall. The area now includes many cafes, bakeries, and galleries, as well as being a central hub for the other bars and restaurants located in the surrounding neighborhoods.

What is commonly called "First Friday" or "Art Murmur" has given way to a vibrant art scene in Oakland which mainly centers around the Uptown District.  Some of the first galleries to open in this area included 21 Grand, the defunct Mama Buzz Cafe (now the [http://telegraphoakland.com/ Telegraph Beer Garden]), and [http://rpscollective.com/ Rock Paper Scissors] (art collective and store.)   More recent notable galleries include Krowswork, [http://www.mercurytwenty.com Mercury 20 Gallery], Johansson Projects and Creative Growth.  In September 2011 Project Bandaloop performed the premier of an aerial dance piece called Bound(less) on The Great Wall of Oakland, and in May 2013 the first annual [http://www.oaklandcatvidfest.com/ Oakland Internet Cat Video Festival] took place on the Great Wall.

Two Mile Wines has produced wines in the Uptown district since 2009, pushing urban winemaking into the heart of Oakland and First Friday.  More recently, Oakland Spirits Company has started producing gins, brandies, and other spirits in the neighborhood, demonstrating that a mix of art, manufacturing, and trades can thrive amidst rapid gentrification.

Uptown is in the so-called [[Oaksterdam]] district of medical marijuana clubs which have contributed to a resurgence in retail and pedestrian activity in the area{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

Uptown is also the home to the Oakland Ice Center, which houses youth and adult amateur hockey leagues, figure skating lessons, and public skating sessions.

'''''We'Moon: Gaia Rhythms for Womyn''''' is an astrological and lunar calendar datebook, featuring art and writing submitted by, for and about women. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt; "Wemoon" means "women," "we of the moon" (for other [[alternative political spelling]]s, see [[Womyn]]). The datebook was founded in 1981 and is published annually in Oregon, USA, by Mother Tongue Ink (d.b.a. We’Moon Company). ''We'Moon'' is a publication focused on “helping women make their daily lives sacred and align themselves with Earth and Moon rhythms.” &lt;ref&gt; Eisenberg, ''Sage Woman Magazine #66''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''We'Moon'' was inspired by the women’s liberation and emerging people's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and came to fruition in the 1980s as a vehicle for the creative expression of women's empowerment and [[earth-based spirituality]]. The idea of a special calendar for women—based on lunar, solar and astrological cycles—originated at Kvindelandet, an international [[womyn's land|women’s land]] in Denmark where 50–60 lesbians from different countries lived together in the late 1970s. The first ''We'Moon'' was self-published in France in 1981 under the name of Mother Tongue Ink, as a pocket-sized astrological moon calendar diary, handwritten in five languages. The first five editions were pocket-sized, homemade, and continually evolving in format, design and technology, changing languages every year. During these years, the datebook was created by groups of volunteers in various locations in Europe. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

''We'Moon '87'' was the first edition created in the U.S., where production has remained. Mother Tongue Ink, d.b.a. We’Moon Company, was incorporated in 1995. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.49, p,58&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mother Tongue Ink published a children’s book, ''The Last Wild Witch'', by [[Starhawk]], illustrated by Lindy Kehoe. ''In the Spirit of We’Moon – Celebrating 30 years – An Anthology of We’Moon Art and Writing'', was released in 2011. ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'' is "an anthology of writing and art originally published in the annual publication ''We'Moon'', with commentary and other new material." &lt;ref&gt; University of Oregon www.libweb.uoregon.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

''We'Moon'' sends out an annual Call for Contributions to women internationally, and publishes approximately 250 pieces of original art and writing in each year’s datebook. ''We'Moon''’s thematic focus includes feminism, goddess and earth-based spirituality, world community, environmentalism, peace and justice. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt;The datebook includes articles by astrologers Gretchen Lawlor, Heather Roan Robbins, [[Susan Levitt]] and Sandra Pastorius. Lunar phase and astrological aspect data are listed for each date. &lt;ref&gt; Sydney L. Murray, ''Vision Magazine'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''We'Moon'' has published work by thousands of contributing women, including writings by [[Joanna Macy]], [[Starhawk]], [[Susan Weed]], [[Winona LaDuke]], [[Carolyn Gage]], [[Myshkin (singer)|Myshkin]], [[Vicki Noble]], [[Donna Henes]], [[Alice Walker]], and founding editor Musawa, and art by [[Monica Sjoo]], [[Tee Corinne]], [[Meinrad Craighead]], Toni Truesdale, [[Betty LaDuke]], Sandra Stanton, Leah Dorion, Max Dashu, Sudie Rakusin and Hrana Janto. &lt;ref&gt; ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p. 242 - 249&lt;/ref&gt;
