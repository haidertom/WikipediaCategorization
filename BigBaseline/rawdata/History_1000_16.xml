The '''''Annales Ceccanenses''''', also called the '''''Chronicon Fossae novae''''', is a chronicle of [[world history]] from the [[birth of Jesus]] down to 1218. It was a written in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century by an anonymous monk of [[Fossanova Abbey]], near [[Ceccano]]. It is partially dependent on the ''[[Annales Cavenses]]'' and ''[[Annales Casinenses]]'', and contains no original material prior to the year 1120. After that it is a valuable source for the history of the [[Papacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Auguste Molinier]], [https://www-persee-fr.bibliopam-evry.univ-evry.fr/web/ouvrages/home/prescript/article/shf_0000-0000_1903_num_3_1_919_t1_0021_0000_6# "2289.

As it originally passed between [[Comitium]] and [[Basilica Aemilia|Basilica Pauli]], the Argiletum was eventually absorbed by the construction of the [[imperial fora]] from the time of [[Julius Caesar]] onwards.  Given this encroachment, the limits of the Argiletum were defined differently in various periods. By the time of [[Martial]] (died ca 103 CE) the Argiletum had become a seedy district filled with taverns and brothels.&lt;ref&gt;Martial 1.2.7-8; 1.3.1; 1.117.9-12; 2.17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Metzler|first1=Dieter
|title=Achsenzeit als Ereignis und Geschichte
|trans-title=Axial age as happening and history |language=German
|journal=Internet-Beiträge zur Ägyptologie und Sudanarchäologie (IBAES)|date=2009|volume=10|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/nilus/net-publications/ibaes10/publikation/metzler_ibaes10.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2018|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and movements==
[[Parshvanatha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Mary Pat | title =Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths | publisher = IB Tauris | year =1997 | location = London | isbn = 1-86064-148-2 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title =Parshvanatha  | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica  | volume = Online  | year =2007  | url =http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9058576  | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]] (24th [[Tirthankara]] in the 6th century BCE), known as the [[fordmaker]]s of [[Jainism]] lived during this age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Mahavira | title = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Answers | date = 28 Nov 2009 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira | title = Mahavira}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first = Robert J | authorlink = Robert J. Zydenbos | title = Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher = Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location = München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html | pages = 11, 56–57, 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W. Malandra|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location= Minneapolis|year=1983|isbn = 0-8166-1114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = "B.A. Brown 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Brian Arthur | authorlink = Brian Arthur Brown | title = Three Testaments: Torah, Gospel, and Quran | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location= Lanham, MD | year= 2012 | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-1-4422-1492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC|title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438401942|series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies|location=|publication-date=2012|page=31|pages=|chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece|quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes. [...] In the economic field, we find a growing occupational differentiation between the economic ties to the land and the urban vocations, be they in trade, craft, industry, or the ritual and educational fields. This phenomenon was also very closely connected with the development of many free economic resources - partially even land and manpower resources -  not bound to ascriptive social units, the concomitant development of widespread internal and external, relatively free, market activities, and the accumulation of relatively mobile capital.|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel N.|editor1-last=Eisenstadt|editor1-first=Shmuel N.|accessdate=2015-06-28}}

Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a "Second Axial Age", including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]].

The '''Bakran tribe'''   or Bagran tribe had connections with the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni Dynasty of Armenia]] and later [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Tirikan tribe]] with the [[Armenians|Armenian]] King [[Tigranes the Great]]. The reconstruction of [[Lake Van]] immediately east of the country of the Bakran tribe.

The Bakran tribe has given its name to the city of [[Diyarbakır]], also engendered the Bagratid royal house, which ruled intermittently, first over the Armenians and later over the Georgians, with major interruptions from the 9th through the beginning of the 19th century. The original domain of the early Bagratids was in fact the area of Diyarbakır to [[Bingöl]] in northwest [[Kurdistan]], according to Tergewondian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kurds: a concise handbook|last= Mehrdad R.

The '''Baradostian culture''' was an [[Upper Paleolithic]] flint industry culture found in the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] region in the border-country between [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nycep.org/ed/download/pdf/2000o%20Asia,%20Western.pdf |title=Benco ''et al.''

Radiocarbon dates suggest that this was one of the earliest Upper Paleolithic complexes, beginning perhaps as early as 36,000 BC. Its relationship, however, to neighbouring cultures remains unclear. [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraqi Kurdistan&lt;!-- Is this actually Baradostian? It has Mousterian layers according to its article. --&gt;, [[Warwasi]] rock-shelter, [[Kaldar Cave]] and [[Yafteh]] Cave in the western Zagros, and [[Eshkaft-e Gavi Cave]] in the southern Zagros are among the major sites to have been excavated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Perhaps precipitated by the most recent cold phase (the [[Würm glaciation]]) of the current ice age, the Baradostian was replaced by a local Epipaleolithic industry called the [[Zarzian culture]]. The Baradostian tool tradition marks the end of the Zagros Paleolithic sequence.

According to M. Otte, the Baradostian of the Zagros clearly belongs to Aurignacian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/120954&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Billy the Kid Trail''', or Broken Trail is a national scenic byway that runs from [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] through [[Capitan, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Billy the Kid Trail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2062/maps|title=Billy the Kid Trail|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail was allegedly once used by [[William H Bonnie]] aka [[Billy The Kid]] and his group during the [[Lincoln County War]]. After a trail nicknamed "The Mexican Blackbird" was proven to be false, Bonnie along with Regulators Charlie Bowdre, Doc Skurlock, David "Biff" Richards, Dirty Steve Stevens, Richard "Dick" Brewer, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Douglas Bartolotta, "Arkansas" Dave Rudabaugh, Cory Windelspecht, Henry William French, and Tom "Tommy" O'Filliard rode this trail while fighting the Murphy/Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War in response to the death of [[John Tunstall]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17045">'''Dominant narrative''' can be used to describe the lens in which history is told by the perspective of the dominant culture. This term has been described as an "invisible hand" that guides reality and perceived reality.&lt;ref name="onegreenplanet.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speaking Truth to Power: Understanding the Dominant, Animal-Eating Narrative for Vegan Empowerment and Social Transformation|url = http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/speaking-truth-to-power-understanding-the-dominant-animal-eating-narrative-for-vegan-empowerment-and-social-transformation/|website = One Green Planet|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative can refer to multiple aspects of life, such as history, politics, or different activist groups. [[Dominant culture]] is defined as the majority cultural practices of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title = Dominant Culture|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = A Dictionary of Sociology|last = Marshall|first = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative]] can be defined as story telling, either true or imaginary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = narrative: definition of narrative in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/narrative|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pairing these two terms together create the notion of dominant narrative, that only the majority story is told and therefore heard. It is a common theme to hear or learn only about the dominant narrative as it comprises the perspective of the majority culture. Examples of dominant narrative can be seen throughout history. Dominant narrative can be defined and decided by the sociopolitical and socioeconomic setting someone lives his or her life in. 

Dominant narrative is similar in some ways to the ideas of [[metanarrative]] or [[grand narrative]].  These two terms refer to the notion that there is a common lived experience, or a totalizing narrative, experience, or account of history.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Unlike the above terms, dominant narrative as a concept is used to explain not just only that there is one narrative told, but what makes it possible for that to be the narrative that is told. This term addresses what the reasons are that the dominant narrative is, in fact, dominant or the majority account.

It is also important to look at who is not included in the dominant narrative and how this can affect society and people in those [[marginalized]] groups. Not everyone has access to being a part of the dominant narrative. Counter-narrative has been coined as the term regarding the stories and lived experiences of those not in the dominant narrative or not allowed to be a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Postmodern Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pX_azoDGfpAC|publisher = Pluto Press|date = 1985-01-01|isbn = 9780745300030|first = Hal|last = Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-narrative are used as a way to share minorities stories excluded and combat the dominant narrative. 

== Who is the dominant narrative? ==
The dominant narrative can most often be seen as those that occupy scholar [[Judith Lorber|Judith Lorber's]] A-Categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Social Construction of Gender|last = Lorber|first = Judith|date = 2006|journal = Inequality Reader: Contemporary &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber defines and describes A-category members as those that occupy the dominant group in different aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, that can be seen in the topic of [[race (human categorization)]] with white being the A-category and all minorities being the not-A; or in the topic of [[gender]] with man being the A-category while woman being the not-A. This notion includes all [[Intersectionality|intersectionalities]] such as age, sexual orientation, CIS/Transgender, ableism, education, and citizenship. The dominant narrative are those that take part in and benefit from being associated with the dominant culture. Having forms of privilege and power that come from being in Lorber's A Categories, can directly relate to being in the dominant culture. The dominant narrative simply consists of whose voice can be recognized and represented when retelling stories, or whose voice/story is perceived as valid or real.

== Critiques and concerns with dominant narrative. ==
There are a number of critiques and concerns with there being a dominant narrative in society. Many of the critiques of there being a dominant narrative come from the exclusion of counter-narratives. To fully understand what the dominant narrative is and understand examples of it is necessary to understand its limitations. Some limitations with there being a dominant narrative include the following:

=== Metanarrative among dominant group ===
Having a dominant narrative can create a notion that there is a metanarrative among the dominant group, meaning all apart of the dominant group are experiencing life the same way. In using the example of the caucasian dominant narrative, this would mean that all Caucasians of somewhat similar sociopolitical and socioeconomic standing are experiencing life and events the same, and that is not true. A dominant narrative can generalize the lived experiences of people within the dominant culture. The metanarrative among the dominant culture creates the notion that whiteness is the norm, and that the dominant culture is the normal culture to which other cultures need to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://evolutioncounseling.com/dominant-culture/|title = Dominant Culture|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = Evolution Counseling|publisher = |last = Schreiner|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived sense of normalcy can be very problematic because it encourages people within the majority to not change and question what could be wrong with having such a strong dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Ignores the lived experiences of minorities ===
Having a dominant narrative based on the dominant culture, therefore means anyone not in the dominant culture cannot be a part of the dominant narrative. Since the dominant narrative is accepted as the norm this, therefore, means those not in the dominant narrative are abnormal. Someone's narrative and perceived narrative can greatly affect how someone views themselves and relates to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarku.edu/~mbamberg/Papers/Counter%20Narratives.htm |title=Considering Counter Narratives |date=2004 |accessdate= |website=Clark.edu |publisher=Clark.edu |last=Bamberg |first=Michael |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017212729/http://www.clarku.edu/~mbamberg/Papers/Counter%20Narratives.htm |archivedate=2011-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone is not part of the dominant narrative and their story is not being told, that means their lived experiences are being ignored and in turn written out of history. Lived experiences, similar to counter-narratives, can be defined as everyday experiences people face and most often referring to those in the minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lived Experience : SAGE Research Methods |url=https://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-social-science-research-methods/n504.xml |website=srmo.sagepub.com |accessdate=2015-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305211440/http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-social-science-research-methods/n504.xml |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lived experiences have also been called material realities, meaning that they are the real, tangible experiences and realities that people live on a daily basis, even if they are counter to the dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.femst.ucsb.edu/projects/crwsj/conversations/archive/20082009/may_2009_workshop/hemmings_telling_feminist_stories.pdf|title = Telling Feminist Stories|last = Hemmings|first = Clare|date = 2005|journal = Feminist Theory|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry is cited for explaining how [[Social inequality|inequalities]], can affect which narrative and tellings are able to be heard and which aren't.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the stories of people with inequalities are not heard, then this completely ignores them, and any agency they could have in society.

=== How does society ever know the truth? ===
Jeyn Roberts is quoted for saying "there are three sides to every story. Yours. Mine. What really happened: the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A quote from Rage Within|url = http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/638626-there-are-three-sides-to-every-story-yours-mine-what|website = Goodreads|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative makes it so only one side of any story is told, this completely ignores any other sides or even the truth. By definition, a dominant narrative does not include every and all aspects of any event. By only learning about and studying the dominant narrative then people are only being educated partially about any historical or current events. This creates a false historical account of most of history. [[Winston Churchill]] has been associated with the saying "history is written by the victors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winston Churchill Quotes at BrainyQuote.com|url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/winstonchu380864.html|website = BrainyQuote|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saying directly relates to the concept of dominant narrative and how the full truth of events as it relates to minorities is not being retold. This means that through mainstream education and media people are not being put forth the most accurate information and historical accounts.

== Examples of dominant narrative ==
Dominant narrative can be seen in almost any aspect of life from media, history, advertising, and activism. The following are some examples of places dominant narrative can be present:

=== History ===
History is one of the most important fields to acknowledge that dominant narrative is present. It is important for people to have a full and accurate understanding of historical events, this is often muddled by the dominant narrative. A historical example of dominant narrative ignoring contributions of people of color can be seen in the military realm. A historical example of black men being ignored for their contributions to the US Military can be understood in the instance of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. The Tuskegee Airmen was a program based out of Tuskegee, AZ in 1941, in which African-American men were trained and educated in multiple aspects relating to war aircraft.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A brief History - Tuskegee Airmen Inc. - The legacy of The Tuskegee Airmen|url = http://tuskegeeairmen.org/explore-tai/a-brief-history/|website = tuskegeeairmen.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to racist ideologies many opposed African-American men being trained to become US Military pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ebony and Ivory: White Officer Foes and Friends of the Tuskegee Airmen|last = Haulman|first = Daniel|date = 2015|journal = Air Power History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Tuskegee Airman overcame great obstacles and contributed immensely to US Military acts in [[World War II]], they have not been given considerable recognition until [[Bill Clinton]] commemorated Tuskegee as a national historic site.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though the Tuskegee Airmen deserved recognition for all they were contributing to the war and in terms of overcoming racial prejudices, because of the WWII dominant narrative they were not given recognition until people fought for their behalf. There are many other historical contributions made by people not in the dominant culture, which are never retroactively recognized and acknowledged. 

=== News Media ===
Like historical accounts, journalism and news media can also be framed in the dominant narrative lens. This historical dominant narrative can affect what news people are actually being exposed to. This is problematic because only news that the dominant narrative deems important receives the most media attention. 
An example of the dominant narrative at play in the media can be seen in the way the [[Rwandan Genocide]]  was almost completely ignored by Western media and news.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This genocide consists of the ethnic majority group, the [[Hutu]], attempting to extinguish the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rwandan Genocide - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|url = http://www.history.com/topics/rwandan-genocide|website = HISTORY.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Rwandan Genocide was not framed by the media as a genocide, in an attempt to ignore the severity of the event.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ignoring Genocide (HRW Report - Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda, March 1999)|url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-01.htm|website = www.hrw.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early developments  of the Rwandan Genocide where minimalized as a way to justify a lack of intervention by many countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since the events in Rwanda did not directly affect US citizens the genocide did not seem to be as big of a deal in media, especially because the genocide consisted of black non-Americans this genocide was hardly discussed, as it is a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But even when race is not a factor at play the mass media can shape the dominant narrative in a way to instil indifference and avoid intervention. This happened, for instance, during the early phases of the breakup of Yugoslavia, as many international authorities disputed and denied that a genocide was taking place in Bosnia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Time We Knew: Western Responses to Genocide in Bosnia|last=Cushman T and Meštrović SG (eds)|first=|publisher=New York: NYU Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
People who do not fit into the dominant narrative can also be written out of activist movements, and in turn written out of history later on. There are some needs and intersections of privilege that are necessary to participate in some forms of activism. Not everyone is able to participate in activist work because of their socioeconomic status, their sociopolitical status, their job safety, their families or childcare needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The privilege and cost of activism {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|url = http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/privilege-and-cost-activism|website = gender.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations like those just mentioned can greatly affect who is active and participates in social activism. Because someone, most likely not in the dominant culture, may not have the means to participate that means their narrative may not be shared. An example of dominant narrative in activism can be seen in [[Women's rights]] movements. [[First-wave feminism]] has been critiqued for a lack of inclusion of black women and race in their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Black feminism and intersectionality {{!}} International Socialist Review|url = http://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality|website = isreview.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist history is often explained in a framework of the contributions made by white affluent and educated American or British women.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Documenting First Wave Feminisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82383">'''Ecclesiastical history of the Catholic Church''' refers to the [[history of the Catholic Church]] as an institution, written from a particular perspective. There is a traditional approach to such [[historiography]]. The generally identified starting point is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], and his work ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]''.

Since there is no assumption that contemporary historians of the Catholic Church who are also Catholics adopt this perspective, this “traditional approach” is a chapter of historiography, not yet closed, but applying to a definite area that is not central to the academic history of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Approach, traditional Catholic view==

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913, 

:''Ecclesiastical history is the scientific investigation and the methodical description of the temporal development of the Church considered as an institution founded by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Ghost for the salvation of mankind.”  Its scope consists “the life of the Church in all its manifestations from the beginning of its existence to our own day among the various divisions of mankind hitherto reached by Christianity. While the Church remains essentially the same despite the changes which she undergoes in time, these changes help to exhibit more fully her internal and external life.''&lt;ref name = CE&gt;{{citation |last=Kirsch |first=Johann Peter |authorlink=Johann Peter Kirsch |year=1910 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07365a.htm |title=Ecclesiastical History|publisher=[[New Advent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its branches therefore include:

*History of missions, in the widest sense
*History of ecclesiastical polity, of heresies and their opponents, and of the relations of the Church with non-Catholic religious associations
*History of dogma, of ecclesiastical theology, and ecclesiastical sciences in general
*History of liturgy
*History of ecclesiastical art
*History of the Catholic hierarchy, of the constitution and [[canon law]] of the Church,
*History of [[religious order]]s
*History of discipline, religious life, [[Christian civilization]].

===Methods===
Critical treatment of the sources requires [[palaeography]], [[diplomatics]], and [[textual criticism|criticism]].

Apart from that, the approach is not that of a [[skeptic]]:

:''The ecclesiastical historian … can by no means exclude the possibility of supernatural factors. That God cannot intervene in the course of nature, and that miracles are therefore impossible is an assumption which has not been and cannot be proved, and which makes a correct appreciation of facts in their objective reality impossible. Herein appears the difference between the standpoint of the believing Christian historian, who bears in mind not only the existence of God but also the relations of creatures to Him, and that of the rationalistic and infidel historian, who rejects even the possibility of Divine intervention in the course of natural law.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

It is based in [[teleology]]:

:'' …the Christian historian keeps in view the fact that the founder of the Church is the Son of God, and that the Church was instituted by Him in order to communicate to the whole human race, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, its salvation through Christ. It is from this standpoint that the Christian historian estimates all particular events in their relation to the end or purpose of the Church. The unbelieving historian on the other hand recognizing only natural forces both at the origin and throughout the development of Christianity, and rejecting the possibility of any supernatural intervention is incapable of appreciating the work of the Church in as far as it is the agent of Divine design.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

As well as taking the Church as its subject matter, it is Church-centered, and takes the Church’s teachings at their own estimation:

:''The Catholic historian insists on the supernatural character of the Church, its doctrines, institutions, and standards of life, in so far as they rest on Divine revelation, and acknowledge the continual guidance of the Church by the Holy Ghost. All this is for him objective reality, certain truth, and the only foundation for the true, scientific pragmatism of ecclesiastical history.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

===Universality===
The fact that [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s have occurred in Christian history is subordinated to the claim to universality of the Catholic Church, which is not treated as one church among many:

:''The Catholic historian does not admit that the various forms of the Christian religion may be taken, roughly speaking, as a connected whole, nor does he consider them one and all as so many imperfect attempts to adapt the teachings and institutions of Christ to the changing needs of the times, nor as progressive steps towards a future higher unity wherein alone we must seek the perfect ideal of Christianity. There is but one Divine revelation given us by Christ, but one ecclesiastical tradition based on it; hence one only Church can be the true one, i. e. the Church in which the aforesaid revelation is found in its entirety, and whose institutions have developed on the basis of this revelation and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

On the other hand, the effect of churches outside the Catholic Church is factored into the discussion.

==Traditional periodization==
===First Period===
The foundation of the Church and the development of fixed standards of ecclesiastical life within the limits of Græco-Roman civilization.

===Second Period===
The Church as a major force in the new Romanic, German, and Slavic states of Europe, the secession of [[Oriental Christendom]] from ecclesiastical unity and the final overthrow of the [[Byzantine empire]].

===Third Period===
The collapse of religious unity among the Western European nations, and the reformation from within of Catholic Church faced with [[Protestantism]]. Immense geographical expansion of the Church, with missionaries in South America, part of North America and numerous in Asia and Africa.

===Turning points===

Some considered the pontificate of [[Gregory the Great]] in 590,&lt;ref&gt;[[August Neander|Neander]], {{ill|Justus Ludwig Jacobi|lt=Jacobi|de}}, [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; or,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Möller|Möller]], {{ill|Karl Müller (theologian)|lt=Karl Müller|de|Karl Müller (Theologe)}}&lt;/ref&gt; more generally, the end of the 6th and the middle of the 7th century as the close of the first period; others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger|Döllinger]] [[Johann Heinrich Kurtz|Kurtz]]&lt;/ref&gt; took the [[Sixth General Council]] in 680, or the [[Trullan synod]] of 692,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Baptist Alzog|Alzog]], [[Joseph Hergenröther|Hergenröther]], [[Franz Xaver von Funk|von Funk]], [[Alois Knöpfler|Knöpfler]]&lt;/ref&gt; or the end of the 7th century; others again close the first period with [[St. Boniface]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Ignatius Ritter|Ritter]], [[Christian Wilhelm Niedner|Niedner]]&lt;/ref&gt; or with the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]], [[Johann Adam Möhler]]&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], [[Karl August von Hase|Hase]], [[Hermann Weingarten|Weingarten]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the West, [[Franz Xaver Kraus|Kraus]] regards the beginning of the 7th century as the close of the first period; for the East, the end of the same century. 

Similarly, along the line of division between the second and the third periods are crowded events of great importance to ecclesiastical life: the [[Renaissance]] with its influence upon all intellectual life, the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] by the Turks, the [[discovery of the Americas]] and the new problems which the Church had to solve in consequence, the appearance of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and the heresy of [[Protestantism]], the [[Council of Trent]] with its decisive influence on the evolution of the interior life of the Church. Protestant historians have regarded the appearance of Luther as the beginning of the third period. A few Catholic authors (e.g. Kraus) closed the second period with the middle of the 15th century.

Nor do authors perfectly agree on the turning-points which are to be inserted within the chief periods. It is true that the conversion of [[Constantine the Great]] affected the life of the Church so profoundly that the reign of this first Christian emperor is generally accepted as marking a sub-division in the first period. In the second period, especially prominent personalities usually mark the limits of the several sub-divisions, e.g. [[Charlemagne]], [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], [[Boniface VIII]], though this leads to the undervaluation of other important factors e. g. the [[East-West Schism|Greek Schism]], the [[Crusades]]. Recent writers, therefore, assume other boundary lines which emphasize the forces active in the life of the Church rather than prominent personalities. In subdividing the third period the same difficulty presents itself. Many historians consider the [[French Revolution]] at the end of the 18th century as an event of sufficient importance to demand a new epoch; others see a distinct epochal line in the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648), with which the formation of great Protestant territories came to an end.

==Sources==
Sources fall naturally into two classes:

# Remains (''reliquiae, Ueberreste'') or immediate sources, i. e. such as prove a fact directly, being themselves part or remnant of the fact. To this class belong e. g. liturgical customs, ecclesiastical institutions, acts of the popes and councils, art-products etc.; also monuments set up to commemorate events, e. g. inscriptions.
# Tradition or mediate sources, i. e. such as rest upon the statements of witnesses who communicate an event to others. Tradition may be oral (narrative and legends), written (writings of particular authors), or pictorial (pictures, statues).

===Remains===
The remains of the Church's past, which give direct evidence of historical facts, are the following:

# Inscriptions, i.e. texts written on durable material, which were either meant to perpetuate the knowledge of certain acts, or which describe the character and purpose of a particular object. The Christian inscriptions of different epochs and countries are now accessible in numerous collections.
# Monuments erected for Christian purposes, especially tombs, sacred edifices, monasteries, hospitals for the sick and pilgrims; objects used in the liturgy or private devotions.
# Liturgies, rituals, particularly liturgical books of various kinds, which were once used in Divine service.
# Necrologies and confraternity-books used at the prayers and public services for the living and the dead.
# Papal acts, Bulls and Briefs to a great extent edited in the papal "Bullaria", "Regesta", and special ecclesiastico-national collections.
# Acts and decrees of general councils and of particular synods.
# Collections of official decrees of Roman congregations, bishops, and other ecclesiastical authorities.
# Rules of faith (Symbola fldei) drawn up for the public use of the Church, various collections of which have been made.
# Official collections of ecclesiastical laws juridically obligatory for the whole Church.
# Rules and constitutions of orders and congregations.
# Concordats between the ecclesiastical and the secular power.
# Civil laws, since they often contain matters bearing on religion or of ecclesiastical interest.

===Tradition===
These comprise those sources which rest on tradition alone, and which, unlike the remains, are themselves no part of the fact. They are:

# Collections of acts of the martyrs, of legends and lives of the saints.
# Collections of lives of the popes (''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'') and of bishops of particular Churches.
# Works of ecclesiastical writers, which contain information about historical events; to some extent all ecclesiastical literature belongs to this category.
# Ecclesiastico-historical works, which take on more or less the character of sources, especially for the time in which their authors lived.
# Pictorial representations (paintings, sculptures, etc.).

==Auxiliary sciences==
Special [[Auxiliary sciences of history|auxiliary sciences]] (e. g. epigraphy, palaeography, numismatics) deal with certain particular kinds of the above-mentioned sources. 

# '''The study of the languages of the sources''', which necessitates the use of lexicons, either general or special (i. e. for the language of particular authors).&lt;ref&gt;Among the general lexicons or glossaries are: [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Fresne du Cange]], "Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae graecitatis" (2 vols., Lyons, 1688); Du Fresne du Cange, "Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis"; [[Egidio Forcellini|Forcellini]], "Lexicon totius latinitatis" (Padua, 1771, often reprinted). "Thesaurus linguae latinae" (begun at Leipzig, 1900)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Palaeography]]''', a methodical introduction to the reading and dating of all kinds of manuscript sources. It was first scientifically investigated and formulated by [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon]], "De re diplomaticâ" (Paris, 1681).&lt;ref&gt;The literature on this subject is to be found in the manuals of [[Noël François de Wailly|de Wailly]], "Elements de Paléographie" (2 vols., Paris, 1838); [[Wilhelm Wattenbach|Wattenbach]], "Latein. Paläog." (4th ed., Leipzig, 1886) and "Schriftwesen im Mittelalter" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1896); [[E. M. Thompson]], "Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography" (2nd ed., London, 1894); [[Maurice Prou|Prou]], "Manuel de Paléographie latine et française" (Paris, 1904); Chassant, "Paléographie des chartes et des manuscrits" (8th ed., Paris, 1885); [[Edmond Reusens|Reusens]], "Elements de paléogr." (Louvain, 1899); [[Cesare Paoli|Paoli]], "Paleografia" (3 vols., Florence, 1888-1900). Charts for practice in reading medieval manuscripts were edited by: Wattenbach, "Script. graec. specimina" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1897); [[Theodor von Sicke|Sickel]], "Monum. graph. medil aevi" (10 series, 1858-82); Bond, Thompson, and Warner, "Facsimiles" (5 series, London, 1873-1903); [[Léopold Victor Delisle|Delisle]], "Album paléogr." (Paris, 1887); Arndt and Tangl, "Schrifttafeln" (3 vols., 1904-6); Chroust, "Mon. palaeogr." (25 series, Munich, 1899-); Steffens, "Latein. Paläogr." (2nd ed., 3 parts, Trier, 1907-); Zangemeister and Wattenbach, "Exempla cod. latin." (1876-9); Sickel and [[Heinrich von Sybel|Sybel]], "Kaiserurkunden in Abbildungen (1880-91); Pflugk-Harttung, "Chartarum pont. Rom. specimina" (3 parts, 1881-6); [[Henry Denifle|Denifle]], "Specimina palæographica ab Inn. III ad Urban. V" (Rome, 1888), A very useful work is [[Adriano Cappelli|Cappelli]], "Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane" (Milan, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Diplomatics]]''', which teaches how to examine critically the form and content of historical documents (e. g. charters, privileges), to pronounce on their genuineness, to understand them correctly, and to use them methodically. It is usually combined with paleography.&lt;ref&gt;The literature may be found in manuals, e. g. Bresslau, "Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien", I (Leipzig, 1889); [[Arthur Giry|Giry]], "Manuel de diplomatique" (Paris, 1894). See also "Nouveau traité de diplomatique" (Paris, 1750-65).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Historical method|Historical Methodology]]''', which enables the student to treat in a correct and critical way all the sources known to him and to combine the results of his researches in a methodical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedrich Blass|Fr. Blass]], "Hermeneutik und Kritik" in [[Ivan von Müller]]'s "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1893); [[Ernst Bernheim|Bernheim]], "Lehrbuch der historischen Methode" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1903); Bernheim, "Das akademische Studium der Geschichtswissenschaft (2nd ed., Greifswald, 1907); Bernheim, "Einleitung in die Geschichtswissenschaft" in "Sammlung Goschen" (Leipzig, 1906); Zurbonsen, "Anleitung zum wissenschaftlichen Studium der Geschichte nebst Materialien" (Berlin, 1906); "Grundriss der Geschichtswissenschaft", edited by Al. Meister, I (Leipzig, 1906); [[Charles-Victor Langlois|Langlois]] and [[Charles Seignobos|Seignobos]], "Introduction aux études historiques" (Paris, 1905); Battaini, "Manuale di metodologia storica" (Florence, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Bibliography]]''', the practical science of finding quickly the literature bearing on a given ecclesiastico-historical subject.&lt;ref&gt;The most important literature is to be found in  ecclesiastico-historical manuals at the end of the various subjects treated, and is given with especial fulness in the fourth edition of Hergenröther's ''Kirchengeschichte'' by [[Johann Peter Kirsch|J. P. Kirsch]] (Freiburg, 1902-9). Among the bibliographical works of special importance for ecclesiastical history must be named: "Bibliotheca hagiographica latina antiquæ et mediae aetatis", edited by the [[Bollandists]] (2 vols., Brussels, 1898-1901); [[August Potthast|Potthast]], "Bibliotheca historica medii ævi" (2nd ed., 2 vols., Berlin, 1896); Bratke, "Wegweiser zu den Quellen und der Literatur der Kirchengeschichte" (Gotha, 1890); Chevalier, "Répertoire des sources historiques du moyen-âge: I.

A third edition comprises the whole of ecclesiastical history, Innsbruck, 1903-). For the history of the several nations see: Wattenbach, "Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter bis zur Mitte des 13. Jahrh."

A bibliography of church history is now to be found in "[[Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique]]" (Louvain, since 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Chronology]]''': how to recognize and fix with accuracy the dates found in the sources. The first important chronological investigations were undertaken by [[Scaliger]] ("De emendatione temporum," Jena, 1629-), [[Petavius]] ("Rationarium temporum", Leyden, 1624; "De doctrinâ temporum", Antwerp, 1703), and the authors of "Art de vérifier les dates des faits historiques" (Paris, 1750-).&lt;ref&gt;The most important recent works are: [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]], "Handbuch der mathem. u. techn. Chronologie" (Berlin, 1825; 2nd ed., 1883); [[Louis de Mas Latrie|De Mas-Latrie]], "Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie pour l'étude et l'emploi des documents du moyen-âge" (Paris, 1889); Brinkmeier, "Praktisches Handbuch der historischen Chronologie aller Zeiten und Völker" (2nd ed., Berlin, 1882); Rühl, "Chronologie des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit" (Berlin, 1897); Lersch, "Einleitung in die Chronologie" (Freiburg, 1899); [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend|Grotefend]], "Zeitrechnung des deutschen Mittelalters und den Neuzeit" (Hanover, 1891-8); Cappelli, "Cronologia e calendario perpetuo" (Milan, 1906); Ginzel, "Handbuch den mathemat. und technischen Chronologie. Das Zeitrechnungswesen den Völker", I (Leipzig, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Ecclesiastical Geography and Statistics''', the first teaches us to recognize the places in which historical events took place, the other represents the development of the Church and the actual condition of her institutions exhibited synoptically, in tables with corresponding figures, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Important works of this kind are: [[Michel Le Quien|Le Quien]], "Oriens christianus" (3 vols., Paris, 1740); Morcelli, "Africa christiana" (2 vols., Brescia, 1816); Toulotte, "Géographie de l'Afrique chrétienne" (Paris, 1892-4); [[Ferdinando Ughelli|Ughelli]], "Italia sacra" (2nd ed., 10 vols., Venice, 1717-22); "Gallia Christiana" by Claude Robert (Paris, 1626), by Denis de Sainte-Marthe and others (new editions, 16 vols., Paris, 1715-); Böttcher, "Germania sacra" (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874); Neher, "Kirchliche Geographie und Statistik" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1864-8); Neher, "Conspectus hierarchiæ catholicæ" (Ratisbon, 1895); Silbernagl, "Verfassung und gegenwärtiger Bestand sämtlicher Kirchen des Orients" (2nd ed., Munich, 1904); Baumgarten, "Die katholische Kirche unserer Zeit und ihre Diener", III (Munich, 1902, 2nd ed., vol.

# '''[[Epigraphy]]''', a guide for the reading and methodical use of the Christian inscriptions on monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Works on this science are: Larfeld, "Griechische Epigraphik" and Hübner, "Römische Epigraphik", both in [[Ivan von Müller]]'s "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumskunde", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1892); Reinash, "Traité d'épigraphie grecque" (Paris, 1886); Cagnat, "Cours d'épigraphie latine" (3rd ed., Paris, 1898); [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi|De Rossi]], "Inscriptiones christianae urbis Romae" I and II, "Introductio" (Rome, 1861-88); [[Edmond-Frederic Le Blant|Le Blant]], "L'épigraphie chrétienne en Gaule et dans l'Afrique romaine" (Paris, 1890); Le Blant, "Paléographie des inscriptions latines de la fin du III au VII siècle" (Paris, 1898); Grisar, "Le iscrizioni cristiane di Roma negli inizi del medio evo" in "Analecta Romana" (Rome, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Christian Archaeology and History of the Fine Arts''', from which the student learns how to study scientifically and to use the monuments which owe their origin to Christian influences.
# '''[[Numismatics]]''', the science of the coins of various countries and ages. Since not only the popes but also the numerous bishops, who once possessed secular power, exercised the right of coinage, numismatics belongs, at least for certain epochs, to the auxiliary sciences of church history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Filippo Bonanni|Bonanni]], "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum" (3 vols., Rome, 1699); "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum et aliarum ecclesiarum" (Cologne, 1704); Vignolius, "Antiqui denarii Romanorum Pontificum a Benedicto XI ad Paulum III" (2 vols., Rome, 1709; new ed. by B.

For further bibliography see von Ebengreuth, "Allgemeine Münzkunde und Geldgeschichte des Mittelalters und den neueren Zeit" (Munich, 1904) and in Engel and Serrure, "Traité de numism. du moyen-âge".&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Sphragistics]]''', or the science of seals (Gk. ''spragis'', a seal). Its object is the study of the various seals and stamps used in sealing letters and documents as a guarantee of their authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Besides the works mentioned above under ''Diplomatics'', see Pflugk and Harttung, "Specimina selecta chartarum Pontificum Romanorum", part III, "Bullae" (Stuttgart, 1887); Pflugk and Harttung, "Bullen der Päpste bis zum Ende des XII Jahrh."

# '''[[Heraldry]]''', which teaches the student how to read accurately the coats of arms etc., used by ecclesiastical and secular lords. It frequently throws light on the family of historical personages, the time or character of particular events, the history of religious monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The literature of this science is very extensive. See Brend, "Die Hauptstücke der Wappenkunde" (2 vols., Bonn, 1841-9); Brend, "Allgemeine Schriftenkunde der gesammten Wappenwissenschaft"; Seiler, "Geschichte den Heraldik" (Nuremberg, 1884); E. von Sacken, "Katechismus der Heraldik" (5th ed., Leipzig, 1893); [[Bernard Burke|Burke]], "Encyclopedia of Heraldry" (London, 1878); Davies, "Encyclopedia of Armory" (London, 1904); Pasini-Frassoni, "Essai d'armorial des papes d'après les manuscrits du Vatican et les monuments publics" (Rome, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historians==
The peoples among which Christianity first spread, possessed a highly developed civilization and a literature rich in works of history. Chronicles were compiled in the 3rd century by [[Julius Africanus]] and by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], some fragments of which survive. It is only during the 4th century that ecclesiastical history, properly so called, makes its appearance.

===Church historians during the First Period===
[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Bishop of Caesarea]] in Palestine (died 340) is styled the "Father of Church History", and wrote a "Chronicle"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XX; edition by Schwartz and [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], 2 vols, in "Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der drei ersten Jahrhunderte", Berlin, 1903-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Church History" was an outgrowth of the "Chronicle", and first appeared in nine books; it covered the time from the death of Christ to the victories of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and Licinius (312 and 313). Eusebius afterwards added a tenth book, which carried the narrative to the victory of Constantine over Licinius (323). He sought to set forth in the most favourable light the Christian sentiments of the imperial convert Constantine and his services to the Christian Church, and has been criticised for his partiality towards Constantine and his palliation of the latter's faults.&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Constantini" in ''Patrologia Graeca'', XX, 905 sqq.; latest scientific ed. Heikel, "Eusebius' Werke", I, Leipzig, 1902, in "Die griech, christl. Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte".&lt;/ref&gt; A brief historical treatise of Eusebius, "On the Martyrs of Palestine", has also been preserved.

This major Christian historian found several imitators in the first half of the 5th century, but their works survive partially if at all. The originals of the first two general narratives of ecclesiastical history after Eusebius have been lost, i.e. the "Christian History" of the presbyter [[Philip of Side]], and the "Church History" of the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Philostorgius]]. Three other early ecclesiastical histories written about this period are also lost, from the presbyter [[Hesychius of Jerusalem]] (died 433), the [[Apollinarian]] [[Timotheus of Berytus]], and [[Sabinus of Heraclea]]. 

About the middle of the 5th century the "Church History" of Eusebius was continued simultaneously by three writers. All three continuations have reached us. The first was written by [[Socrates Scholasticus]], an advocate (''scholasticus'') of Constantinople, who, in his "Church History",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXVII, 29-842; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt; which he expressly (I, 1) calls a continuation of the work of Eusebius, describes in seven books the period from 305 (Abdication of Diocletian) to 439. The author is honest, exhibits critical acumen in the use of his sources, and has a clear and simple style. After him, and frequently making use of his history, comes [[Hermias Sozomenus]] (or Sozomen), also an advocate in Constantinople, whose "Church History" in nine books comprises the period from 324 to 425.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXVII, 834-1630; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1860&lt;/ref&gt; Both these writers are surpassed by [[Theodoret]], [[Bishop of Cyrus]] (died about 458), who, in his "Church History",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXII, 881-1280; ed. [[Thomas Gaisford|Gaisford]], Oxford, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; a continuation of the work of Eusebius, describes in five books the period from the beginning of [[Arianism]] (320) to the beginning of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] troubles (428). In addition to the writings of his predecessors, [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]] and Sozomen, he also used those of the Latin scholar [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], and wove many documents into his narrative. [[Theodoret]] wrote also a "History of the Monks",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXII, 1283-1496.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sets forth the lives of thirty famous ascetics of the Orient. Like the "History of the Holy Fathers"  or "[[Historia Lausiaca]]", so called from one [[Lausus (eunuch)|Lausus]] to whom the book was dedicated by [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], written about 420,&lt;ref&gt;Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', XXXIV, 995-1278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "The Lausiac History of Palladius", Cambridge, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; this work of Theodoret is one of the principal sources for the history of Oriental monasticism. Theodoret also published a "Compendium of Heretical Falsehoods", i. e. a short history of heresies with a refutation of each.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXIII, 335-556.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the similar "[[Panarion]]" of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', XLI-XLII&lt;/ref&gt; it offers material on the earliest heresies.

During the 6th century these historians found other continuators. [[Theodorus Lector]] compiled a brief compendium from the works of the above-mentioned three continuators of Eusebius: Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret. He then wrote in two books an independent continuation of this summary as far as the reign of [[Emperor Justin I]] (518-27); only fragments of this work have reached us.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXVI, I, 165-228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zacharias Rhetor]], at first an advocate at [[Berytus]] in [[Phoenicia]] and then (at least from 536) [[Bishop of Mitylene]] in the Island of [[Lesbos]], composed, while yet a layman, an ecclesiastical history, which describes the period from 450 to 491, but is mostly taken up with personal experiences of the author in Egypt and Palestine. A Syriac version of this work is extant as books III-VI of a Syriac universal history, while there are also extant some chapters in a Latin version.&lt;ref&gt;Laud, "Anecdota Syriaca", Leyden, 1870; ''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXV, 1145-78; Ahrens and Krüger, "Die sogennante Kirchengeschichte des Zacharias Rhetor", Leipzig, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this history, his inclination towards [[Monophysitism]] is also apparent from his biography of the Monophysite patriarch, [[Severus of Antioch]], and from his biography of the monk Isaias, two works extant in a Syriac version.&lt;ref&gt;Laud, "Anecdota Syriaca", Leyden, 1870, 346-56, edited the "Life of Isaias", and Spanuth, Göttingen, 1893, the "Life of Severus"; cf. Nau in "Revue de l'orient chrétien", 1901, pp. 26-88.&lt;/ref&gt; More important still is the "Church History" of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], who died about the end of the 6th century. His work is a continuation of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and treats in six books the period from 431 to 594. It is based on good sources, and borrows from profane historians but occasionally Evagrius is too credulous. For Nestorianism and Monophysitism, however, his work deserves careful attention.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXVI, I, 2415-886; edd. Bidez and Parmentier in "Byzantine Texts" by [[J. B. Bury]], London, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the chronicles that belong to the close of Græco-Roman antiquity, special mention is due to the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', so called because the Paschal or Easter canon forms the basis of its Christian chronology.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', XCII.&lt;/ref&gt; About the year 700 the Monophysite bishop, [[John of Nikiu]] (Egypt) compiled a universal chronicle; its ''notitiae'' are of great value for the 7th century. This chronicle has been preserved in an Ethiopic version ("Chronique de Jean, évêque de Nikiou", publ. par. [[Hermann Zotenberg|H. Zotenberg]], Paris, 1883). Zotenberg believes that the work was originally written in Greek and then translated; [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]] ("Gottinger gelehrte Anzeigen", 1881, 587 sqq.) thinks it more probable that the original was Coptic. To the Alexandrian Cosmas, known as the "Indian Voyager" we owe a Christian "Topography" of great value for ecclesiastical geography (ed. Montfaucon, "Collectio nova Patrum et Scriptor. græc", II, Paris, 1706; translated into English by McCrindle, London, 1897). Of great value also for ecclesiastical geography are the "[[Notitiae episcopatuum]]" (''Taktika''), or lists of the patriarchal, metropolitan, and episcopal sees of the Greek Church ("Hieroclis Synecdemus et Notitiae graecae episcopatuum", ed. Parthey, Berlin, 1866; "Georgii Cyprii Descriptio orbis Romani", ed. Geizer, Leipzig, 1890). A major collection of the early Greek historians of the Church is that of [[Henri Valois|Henri de Valois]] in three folio volumes (Paris, 1659–73; improved by [[William Reading]], Cambridge, 1720); it contains [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]], [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], [[Sozomen]], [[Theodoret]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], and the fragments of [[Philostorgius]] and [[Theodorus Lector]]. 

The ancient Syrian writings of ecclesiastico-historical interest are chiefly Acts of martyrs and hymns to the saints ("Acta martyrum et sanctorum", ed. Bedjan, Paris, 1890-). The "Chronicle of Edessa", based on ancient sources, was written in the 6th century (ed. [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani|Assemani]], "Bibliotheca orientalis", I, 394). In the same century the Monophysite bishop, [[John of Ephesus]], wrote a history of the Church, but only its third part (571 to 586) is preserved (ed. [[William Cureton]], Oxford, 1853; tr., Oxford, 1860). Lengthy extracts from the second part are found in the annals of Dionysius of Telmera. His work covers the years 583-843 (fragments in Assemani, "Bibliotheca orientalis", II, 72 sqq.). Among the Armenians we meet with versions of Greek and Syriac works. The most important native Armenian chronicle of an ecclesiastico-historical character is ascribed to [[Moses of Chorene]], a historical personage of the 5th century. The author of the "History of Greater Armenia" calls himself Moses of Chorene, and claims to have lived in the 5th century and to have been a disciple of the famous [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop]] (q. v.). The self-testimony of the compiler must be rejected, since the work makes use of sources of the 6th and 7th centuries, and there is no trace of it to be found in Armenian literature before the 9th century. Probably, therefore, it originated about the 8th century. In the known manuscripts the work contains three parts: the "Genealogy of Greater Armenia" extends to the dynasty of the [[Arsacide]]s, the "Middle Period of our Ancestry" to the death of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], and the "End of the History of our Country" to the downfall of the Armenian Arsacides (ed. Amsterdam, 1695; Venice, 1881; French translation in Langlois, "Collection des historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arménie", 2 vols., Paris, 1867-9). In the Middle Ages there was still extant a fourth part. The work seems to be on the whole reliable. The ancient history, down to the 2nd or 3rd century after Christ, is based on popular legends. Another Armenian historian is [[Eliseus Vartaped]] (q. v.).

Comprehensive ecclesiastico-historical works appear in the Latin West later than in the Greek East. The first beginnings of historical science are confined to translations with additions. Thus [[St. Jerome]] translated the "Chronicle" of Eusebius and continued it down to 378. At the same time he opened up a special field, the history of Christian literature, in his "[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]"; ("Chronicon", ed. Schoene, 2 vols., Berlin, 1866–75; "De vir. ill.", ed. Richardson, Leipzig, 1896). About 400 the "Church History" of Eusebius was translated by Rufinus who added the history of the Church from 318 to 395 in two new books (X and XI). Rufinus's continuation was itself soon translated into Greek. The latest edition is in the Berlin collection of Greek Christian writings mentioned above in connexion with Eusebius. St. Jerome's Latin recension of the "Chronicle" of Eusebius was followed later by many other chronicles, among which may be mentioned the works of [[Prosper of Aquitaine|Prosper]], [[Idacius]], Marcellinus, [[Victor of Tunnuna|Victor of Tununum]], [[Marius of Avenches]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Venerable Bede]]. In the West, the first independent history of revelation and of the Church was written by [[Sulpicius Severus]], who published in 403 his "Historia (Chronica) Sacra" in two books; it reaches from the beginning of the world to about 400 (P. L., XX; ed. Hahn, Vienna, 1866). It is a short treatise and contains little historical information. A little later, [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] wrote his "Historia adversus paganos" in seven books—a universal history from the standpoint of the Christian apologist. It begins with the deluge and comes down to 416. The purpose of Orosius was to refute the pagan charge that the great misfortunes of the Roman Empire were due to the victory of Christianity (P. L., XXXI; ed. Zangemeister, Vienna, 1882). With the same end in view, but with a far grander and loftier conception, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] wrote his famous "[[De civitate Dei]]", composed between 413 and 428, and issued in sections. It is an apologetic philosophy of history from the standpoint of Divine revelation. The work is important for church history on account of its numerous historical and archaeological digressions (ed. Dombart, 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1877). About the middle of the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] caused the works of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret to be translated into Latin, and then amalgamated this version into one complete narrative under the title "Historia tripartita" (P. L., LXIX-LXX). Together with the works of Rufinus and Orosius, it was one of the principal sources from which through the Middle Ages the Western peoples drew their knowledge of early church history. Rich material for ecclesiastical history is also contained in the national histories of some Western peoples. Of the "History of the Goths", written by Cassiodorus, we possess only an extract in [[Jordanis]], "[[Getica (Jordanes)|De origine actibusque Getarum]]" (ed. Mommsen in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Auct. antiquissimi", V., Berlin, 1882). Especially important is the "History of the Franks" in ten books by [[Gregory of Tours]], which reaches to 591 (ed. Arndt, "Mon. Germ. Hist: Scriptores rerum Meroving.", I, Hanover, 1884-5). Gregory wrote also a "Liber de vitâ Patrum", a work entitled "In gloriâ martyrum", and the book "De virtutibus (i.e. miracles) S. Juliani" and "De virtutibus S. Martini" (ed. cit., pt. II, ad. Krusch). In the beginning of the 7th century St. Isidore of Seville composed a "Chronicle of the West Goths" ("[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum]]", ed. Mommsen, "Chronica Minora", II, 241-303). Several other similar chronicles, from the 4th to the 7th century, were edited by Mommsen in the "[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Auctores Antiquissimi" under the title of "Chronica Minora".

===The Church historians of the Second Period===
The second period of church history produced a copious specialized historical literature. Its works deal more often with particular nations, dioceses, and abbeys; general histories are rare. Moreover, owing to the dominant position of the Church among the Western peoples, ecclesiastical and secular history are in this epoch closely interwoven.

In the East church history is almost completely identified with the history of the imperial court owing to the close relations of State and Church. For the same reason the Byzantine chronicles from [[Justinian the Great]] to the destruction of the empire in the middle of the 15th century contain information about the history of the Greek Church.&lt;ref&gt;The most important of them are: the "Chronography of [[Theophanes Isaacius]]" ed. de Boor, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1885; the "Chronicles" of [[Georgius Syncellus]], [[George Hamartolus]], [[Nicephorus, Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], [[John Malalas]], [[Procopius]], [[Paulus Silentiarius]], the works of [[Leo Diaconus]], [[Anna Comnena]], [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], [[Georgius Cedrenus]], to which we may add [[Nicetas Choniates]], [[Georgius Pachymeres]], [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], and [[John Cantacuzenus]]. These Byzantine historical works were first published in a large collection at Paris (1645-1711) under the title, "Byzantinae historiae Scriptores". A new edition, better and more complete, was executed by Niebuhr, Becker, Dindorf, and other collaborators in forty volumes (Bonn, 1828-78) under the title, "Corpus Scriptorum historiae Byzantinae". Most of these writings are also to be found in the Patrologia Graeca of [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]].&lt;/ref&gt; The major church historian of the Byzantine period is [[Nicephorus Callistus]], who flourished in the beginning of the 14th century.

In Syriac we possess the aforesaid chronicle of [[Dionysius of Telmera]]. Towards the end of the 12th century [[Michael Kandis]], Patriarch of the Jacobites (died 1199), wrote a chronicle from the creation to 1196. It is an important source for the history of the Syriac Church after the 6th century, particularly for the history of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;This work has reached us in a 13th century Armenian version; a French translation was published by Langlois, "Chronique de Michel le Grand" (Venice, 1868).&lt;/ref&gt; Another patriarch of the Jacobites, [[Gregory Abulpharagius]] or Bar-Hebraeus, Maphrian (i. e. primate) of the Syro-Jacobite Church (1266–86), also wrote a universal chronicle in three parts. We must also mention the "Bibliotheca" (Myriobiblon) of [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (died 891), in which about 280 authors are described and passages quoted from them,&lt;ref&gt;ed. Becker, Berlin, 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; and the work "On Heresies" of [[St. John Damascene]].

Throughout this period the West was furnishing abundant material for ecclesiastical history, but few genuinely historical works. In the 9th century, [[Haymo, Bishop of Halberstadt]] (died 853), undertook to write an ecclesiastical history of the first four centuries, taking [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] as his principal authority.&lt;ref&gt;"De christianarum rerum memoriâ", ed. Boxhorn, Leyden, 1650; P. L., CXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, with the aid of Latin versions of Georgius Syncellus, Nicephorus, and especially of Theophanes, to which he added his own material, the Roman Abbot [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (the Librarian) wrote a "Church History" to the time of Leo the Armenian, who died in 829.&lt;ref&gt;Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', CVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; 

About the middle of the 12th century, [[Ordericus Vitalis]], Abbot of St. Evroul in Normandy, wrote an "Historia ecclesiastica" in thirteen books; it reaches to 1142, and is of especial value for the history of Normandy, England, and the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;ed. A. Le Prevost, 5 vols., Paris, 1838-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominican [[Bartholomew of Lucca]], called also Ptolemæus de Fiadonibus (died 1327), covered a longer period. His work in twenty-four books reaches to 1313, and was continued to 1361 by [[Henry of Diessenhofen]].&lt;ref&gt;ed. Muratori, "Scriptores Rerum Italicarum ", XI.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Flores chronicorum seu Catalogus Pontificum Romanorum" of [[Bernard Guidonis]], [[Bishop of Lodève]] (died 1331), may be counted among the works on the general history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Partially edited by Mai, "Spicilegium Romanum", VI; Muratori, "Scriptores Rerum Italicarum ", III; Bouquet, "Script. rer. gall.", XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensive, and relatively the best, historical work during this period is the "Summa Historialis" of [[Antoninus of Florence|St. Antoninus]]. It deals with secular and ecclesiastical history from the creation to 1457.

The national histories which appeared towards the end of the last period (of [[Cassiodorus]], [[Jordanis]], [[Gregory of Tours]], were followed by similar works giving the history of other peoples. [[Venerable Bede]] wrote his admirable ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', which describes in five books the history of England from the Roman conquest to 731, though treating principally of events after [[Augustine of Canterbury]]'s mission in 596.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Stevenson, London, 1838; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulus Warnefrid]] (Diaconus) wrote the history of his fellow-Lombards (''Historia Langobardorum'') from 568 to 733; it still remains the principal source for the history of his people. An unknown writer continued it to 774, and in the 9th century the monk [[Erchembert]] added the history of the Lombards of Beneventum to 889.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Waitz in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script. rer. Langob. et Ital.", Hanover, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; Paulus wrote also a history of the bishops of Metz ("Gesta episcoporum Mettensium", ad. in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", II) and other historical works. The Scandinavian North found its ecclesiastical historian in [[Adam of Bremen]]; he covers the period between 788 and 1072, and his work is of special importance for the history of the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Diocese of Hamburg-Bremen]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gesta Hamburgensis ecclesiæ Pontificum", ed. Lappenberg in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", VII, 276 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flodoard]] (died 966) wrote the history of the [[Archdiocese of Reims]] (Historia ecclesiæ Remensis) to 948, a very important source for the history of the Church of France to that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Mon. Germ. Hist. Script.", XIII, 412 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ecclesiastical history of Northern Germany was described by [[Albert Crantz]], a canon of Hamburg (died 1517), in his "Metropolis" or "Historia de ecclesiis sub Carolo Magno in Saxoniâ instauratis" (i. e. from 780 to 1504; Frankfort, 1576 and often reprinted). Among the special historical works of this period of the Western Church we must mention the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', an important collection of papal biographies that take on larger proportions after the 4th century, are occasionally very lengthy in the 8th and 9th centuries, and through various continuations reach to the death of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1431.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Duchesne, 2 vols., Paris, 1886-92; ed. Mommsen, I, extending to 715, Berlin 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The German, Italian, French, and English chronicles, annals, and biographies of this epoch are very numerous.&lt;ref&gt;The more important authors of chronicles are: [[Regino of Prüm]], [[Hermannus Contractus]], [[Lambert of Hersfeld]], [[Otto of Freising]], [[William of Tyre]], [[Sigebert of Gemblours]]. Important collections, in which the reader can find the chronicles and annals of the various Christian countries, are the following: for England: "Rerum Britannicarum medii ævi Scriptores, or Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain", I sqq. (London, 1858-); for Belgium: "Collection de Chroniques belges", I sqq. (Brussels, 1836-); "Collection des chroniqueurs et trouvères belges publ. par l'Académie belge", I sqq. (Brussels, 1863-); "Recueil de chroniques publié par la [[Société d'émulation|Société d'émulation de Bruges]]" (56 vols., Bruges, 1839-64); for France: Bouquet, "Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France" (Paris, 1738-; new ed. by L. Delisle, Paris, 1869-); for Germany: " Monumenta Germ. historica: Scriptores", I sqq. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826-); for Italy: Muratori, "Rerum Italicarum Scriptores præcipui" (25 vols., Milan, 1723-51); Muratori, "Antiquitates Italicæ medii ævi" (6 vols., Milan, 1738-42); for Spain: Flórez, "España sagrada" (51 vols., Madrid, 1747-1886); for Austria: "Fontes rerum Austriacarum: Scriptores" (8 vols., Vienna, 1855-75); for Poland: Bielowski, "Monuments Poloniæ historica" (2 vols., Lemberg, 1864-72; continued by the Academy of Cracow, III sqq., Cracow, 1878-); "Scriptores rerum polonicarum" (Cracow, 1873-); for Denmark and Sweden: Langebek, "Scriptores rerum Danicarum medii ævi" (9 vols., Copenhagen, 1772-8); Fant, "Scriptores rerum Suecicarum medii ævi" (3 vols., Upsala, 1818-76); Rietz, "Scriptores Suecici medii ævi" (3 vols., Lund, 1842). Other important collections are: L. d'Achéry, "Spidilegium veterum aliquot scriptorum" (13 vols., Paris, 1655); Mabillon, "Acts Sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti" (9 vols., Paris, 1668); "Acts Sanctorum Bollandistarum" (see [[Bollandists]]). The best guide to the sources of medieval history is Potthast, "Bib. hist. medii ævi: Wegweiser durch die Geschichtswerke des europäischen Mittelalters bis 1500" (Berlin, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church historians of the Third Period===

With the 16th century a new epoch dawned for ecclesiastical history: historical criticism went hand in hand with the growth of humanist education. The sources of historical events were examined as to their authenticity.

The religious controversies that followed the rise of Protestantism were also an incentive to historical study. Printing made possible a rapid distribution of all kinds of writings, so that the sources of church history soon became known and studied in the widest circles, and new works on church history could be circulated in all directions.

====From the middle of the 16th to the middle of the 17th century====
The first large work on church history which appeared in this period was composed in the interests of [[Lutheranism]]. [[Mathias Flacius]], called ''Illyricus'' (a native of Illyria), united with five other Lutherans ([[John Wigand]], [[Mathias Judex]], [[Basilius Faber]], [[Andreas Corvinus]], and [[Thomas Holzschuher]]), to produce an extensive work, that should exhibit the history of the Church as a convincing apology for strict Lutheranism. (See [[Centuriators of Magdeburg]].) In the "Centuriæ", a partisan work, the institutions of the Roman Church appear as works of Satan and darkness. It called forth Catholic refutations, particularly that of [[Cæsar Baronius]]. Urged by [[Philip Neri]], he undertook in 1568 the task of producing an ecclesiastical history, which he brought down to the end of the 12th century and published under the title, ''[[Annales ecclesiastici]]'' (12 vols., Rome, 1588–1607). Numerous editions and continuations of it then appeared.

====From the middle of the 17th to the end of the 18th century====

;Catholic Church historians
From the middle of the 17th century French writers were active in ecclesiastico-historical research. The writings of the Fathers of the Church and other ancient sources were published in better editions, and the auxiliary sciences of history were well cultivated. [[Antoine Godeau]], [[Bishop of Vence]], wrote a "Histoire de l'église" reaching to the 9th century (5 vols., Paris, 1655–78; several other editions appeared and the work was translated into Italian and German), and to the Oratorian [[Cabassut]] for "Historia ecclesiastica" (Lyons, 1685). Although the Jesuit [[Louis Maimbourg]] did not write a continuous ecclesiastical history, he published numerous treatises (Paris, 1673–83): on Arianism, Iconoclasm, the Greek Schism, struggle between the popes and the emperors, Western Schism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism. 

Among the major ecclesiastical historians of this period are: [[Noël Alexandre]] (Natalis Alexander) a Dominican; [[Claude Fleury]], who wrote a "Histoire ecclésiastique" in 20 volumes, reaching to 1414 (Paris, 1691–1720) as a moderate Gallican; and [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]]. To these must be added [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], who, in his "Discours sur l'histoire universelle" (Paris, 1681), treated the history of the Church as far as Charlemagne. His "Histoire des variations des églises protestantes" (2 vols., Paris, 1688) describes the changes which the Waldenses, Albigenses, Wyclifites, and Hussites, as well as Luther and Calvin, made to the fundamental doctrines of the Catholic Church. 

Their successors in the 18th century compare unfavourably with their predecessors, in criticism of their sources and in scientific accuracy. The following are noteworthy: [[François Timoléon de Choisy]], "Histoire de l'Église" (11 vols., Paris, 1706–23); [[Bonaventure Racine]] (Jansenist), "Abrégé de l'histoire ecclesiastique" (13 vols., Cologne, properly Paris, 1762-7); [[Gabriel Ducreu]], "Les siècles chrétiens" (9 vols., Paris, 1775; 2nd ad. in 10 vols., Paris, 1783). The widest circulation was attained by the "Histoire de l'Église" of [[Bérault-Bercastel]].

Italy during this period was productive mainly, however, in Christian archæology and special departments of history. The names of Cardinals Noris, Bona, and Pallavicini, Archbishop [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]] of Lucca, the Vatican librarian Zacagni, [[Ferdinando Ughelli]], Roncaglia, Bianchini, Muratori, the brothers Pietro and Girolamo Ballerini, Gallandi, and Zaccaria, indicate the extent of historical research carried on in Italy during the 18th century. Among the general histories of the Church is the "Storia Ecclesiastica" of the Dominican [[Giuseppe Agostino Orsi]]. A church history of similarly vast proportions was undertaken by the Oratorian [[Sacarelli]]. A third work, of an even more comprehensive nature and reaching to the beginning of the 18th century, was written by the French Dominican, [[Hyacinthe Graveson]], resident in Italy, "Historia ecclesiastica variis colloquiia digesta" (12 vols., Rome, 1717-). Mansi continued it in two volumes to 1760. Compendia of general church history, widely read, were written by the Augustinian [[Lorenzo Berti]] ("Breviarium historiæ ecclesiasticæ", Pisa and Turin, 1761-8), who also wrote three volumes of "Dissertationes historicæ" (Florence, 1753-6); [[Carlo Sigonio]], who treated the first three centuries (2 vols., Milan, 1758), and [[Giuseppe Zola]], who treats the same period in his "Commentarium de rebus ecclesiasticis" (3 vols., Pavia, 1780-), and who also wrote "Prolegomena comment. de rebus eccl." (3 vols., Pavia, 1779).

In Spain, the Augustinian [[Enrique Flórez]] began at this period a monumental work on the ecclesiastical history of Spain, ''España sagrada'', which at the death of the author in 1773 had reached its twenty-ninth volume. [[Manuel Risco]] continued it to the forty-second volume, and, since his death, it has been carried still nearer to completion, the fifty-first volume appearing in 1886. Some special works appeared in Germany, monographs of particular dioceses and monasteries, but general church history was not cultivated until Joseph II had executed his reform of theological studies. Among them are Lumper's "Institutiones historiæ ecclesiasticæ" (Vienna, 1790); the "Institutiones historiæ eccl." of Dannenmeyer (2 vols., Vienna, 1788), relatively the best; the "Synopsis histor. relig. et eccles. christ." of Royko (Prague, 1785); the "Epitome hist. eccl." of Gmeiner (2 vols., Gratz, 1787–1803), and similar works by Wolf, Schmalzfuss, Stöger, Becker. The Netherlands produced compendia, e. g. those of Mutsaerts (2 vols., Antwerp, 1822), Rosweyde (2 vols., Antwerp, 1622), M. Chefneux ("Eccl. Cathol. speculum chronographicum", 3 vols., Liège, 1666–70). 

;Protestant Church historians
It was some time after the publication of the "Magdeburg Centuries" (see above) before Protestant scholars again undertook extensive independent work in the province of church history. Their  division into Reformed and Lutherans on the one hand, and the domestic feuds among the Lutherans on the other, were distractions. When Protestant scholarship again arose, the Reformed Churches took the lead and retained it into the 18th century. This was true not only in the domain of special history, in which they issued important publications (e. g. Bingham's "Antiquitates ecclesiasticæ", 1722; the works of Grabe, Beveridge, Blondel, Daillé, Saumaise, Usher, Pearson, Dodwell, etc.), but also in that of general church history. Among these writers are: [[Johann Heinrich Hottinger]], whose "Historia ecclesiastica Novi Test." (9 vols., Hanover, 1655–67) is hostile to the Catholic Church; [[Jacques Basnage]], the opponent of Bossuet ("Histoire de l'Église depuis Jésus-Christ jusqu'à présent", Rotterdam, 1699); [[Antoine Basnage]], the opponent of Baronius ("Annales politico-eccles." 3 vols., Rotterdam, 1706), and Spanheim ("Introductio ad hist. et antiquit. sacr.", Leyden, 1687; "Historia ecclesiastica", Leyden, 1701). The Reformed Churches produced moreover a number of manuals of church history, e. g. Turettini, "Hist. eccles. compendium" (Halle, 1750); Venema, "Institut. histor. eccl." (5 vols., Leyden, 1777); Jablonski, "Institut. hist. eccl." (2 vols., Frankfort, 1753). Similar Protestant manuals appeared in England, e. g. Milner, "History of the Church of Christ" (4 vols., London, 1794); Murray "History of Religion" (4 vols., London, 1794), and Priestley, "History of the Christian Church".

During the 17th century, the Lutherans produced a "Compendium histor. eccl." by Seckendorf and Bockler (Gotha, 1670-6). But a new era in Lutheran ecclesiastical historiography dates from Arnold's "Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzerhistorie" (2 vols., Frankfort am M., 1699). This pietist author is friendly to all the sects, but hostile to the Catholic Church and orthodox Lutheranism. Calmer is [[Eberhard Weissmann]]'s "Introductio in memorabilia ecclesiastica historiæ sacræ Novi Test." (2 vols., Tübingen, 1718). The Latin historical writings of Joh. Lor. [[Mosheim]], particularly his "De rebus christ. ante Constantinum Magnum" (Helmstadt, 1753), and "Institutiones histor. eccles. antiquioris et recentioris" (Helmstadt, 1755), treat the Church as an institution of secular origin. His "Institutiones" were translated into German and continued by two of his pupils, J. von Einem and Rud. Schlegel (Leipzig, 1769-; Heilbronn, 1770-). Further progress was made in the works of Pfaff, chancellor of Tübingen ("Institutiones histor. eccl.", Tübingen, 1721), of Baumgarten ("Auszug der Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Halle, 1743-), Pertsch ("Versuch einer Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols, Leipzig, 1736-), Cotta ("Versuch einer ausführlichen Kirchenhistorie des neuen Testamentes", 3 vols., Tübingen, 1768–73). Specialised works were written by the two Walchs-Joh. Georg Walch issuing "Eine Geschichte der Reigionsstreitigkeiten innerhalb und ausserhalb der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche" in two parts, each comprising five volumes (Jena, 1733-9) while his son Christian Wilhelm published a lengthy "ketzergeschichte", whose eleventh volume reaches to the Iconoclasts (Leipzig, 1762–85). The latter also wrote a "Religionsgeschichte der neuesten Zeit", beginning with Clement XIV (to which Planck added three volumes) also a "Historie der Kirchenversammlungen" (Leipzig, 1759), and a "Historic der röm. Päpste" (Göttingen, 1758). 

The major Lutheran work on general church history is that of [[J. Mathias Schröckh]], a pupil of Mosheim and a professor at Wittenberg: "Christliche Kirchengeschichte bis zur Reformation" in thirty-five volumes (Leipzig, 1768–1803), continued as "Kirchengeschichte seit der Reformation" in eight volumes (Leipzig, 1803-8), to which Tzschirmer added two others (1810–12). The whole work includes forty-five volumes and closes with the beginning of the 19th century. The works of [[Johannes Salomon Semler]] were his "Historiæ eccles. selecta capita" (3 vols., Halle 1767-), "Versuch eines fruchtbaren Auszuges der kirchengeschichte" (3 parts, Halle, 1778), and "Versuch christlicher Jahrbücber" (2 parts, Halle, 1782). Most of his contemporaries wrote church history as a chronicle of scandals (''Scandalchronik''): superstition, fanaticism, and human passion. This spirit is particularly characteristic of Spittler, "Grundriss der Gesch. der christl. Kirche" and Henke, "Allgem. Geschichte der chr. K."

====The 19th century====
Romanticism led to an appreciation of the Catholic medieval world, while in all departments of learning there appeared a desire to be objective in judgment. The sources of ecclesiastical history were studied via historical criticism.

===Catholic ecclesiastical historians===
It was in Catholic Germany that these changes were first noticeable, particularly in the work of the convert, [[Count Leopold von Stolberg]]. His "Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi" was issued in fifteen volumes, the first four of which contain the history of the Old Testament and reach to 430. Similarly, the less important "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" (9 vols., Ravensburg, 1824–34) by Locherer, rather uncritical and exhibiting the influence of Schröckh, remained unfinished, and reaches only to 1073. The excellent "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" by J. Othmar von Rauschen is also incomplete. A useful compendium, serious and scientific in character, was begun by Hortig, professor at Landshut, the "Handbuch der christlichen Kirchengeschichte". He completed two volumes (Landshut, 1821-), and reached the Reformation; a third volume, that brought the work down to the French revolution, was added by his successor [[Döllinger]]. This scholar, who later on abandoned the Catholic attitude and principles of his earlier days, excelled previous writers. [[Johann Adam Möhler]] wrote several special historical works and dissertations of exceptional merit. His lectures on general church history were published after his death by his pupil, the Benedictine Pius Gams ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867). To these larger and epoch-making works must be added several compendia, some of which like Klein ("Historia ecclesiastica", Gratz, 1827), Ruttenstock ("Institutiones hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Vienna, 1832-4), Cherrier ("Instit. hist. eccl.", 4 vols., Pestini, 1840-), were bare summaries of facts; others, like [[Joseph Ignatius Ritter|Ritter]] (''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte'', 3 vols., Bonn, 1830; 6th ed. by Ennen, 1861), and Alzog ("Universalgeschichte der christlichen Kirche", Mains, 1840; 10th ed. by [[Franz Xaver Kraus|F. X. Kraus]], 1882), are lengthy narratives, critical and thorough. Particular periods or epochs of ecclesiastical history soon found careful cultivation, e. g. by Riffel, "Kirchengeschichte der neuen und neuesten Zeit, vom Anfang der Glaubensspaltung im 16. Jahrhundert" (3 vols., Mainz, 1841-6); Damberger, "Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter" (in 15 volumes, Ratisbon, 1850–63; the last volume edited by Rattinger), which reaches to 1378. With Döllinger and Möhler we must rank Karl Joseph Hefele, the third of the great German Catholic historians, whose valuable "Konziliengeschichte" is really a comprehensive work on general church history;. the first seven volumes of the work (Freiburg, 1855–74) reach to 1448. A new edition was begun by the author (Freiburg, 1873-); it was carried on by Knöpfler (vole. V-VII), while Hergenröther (later cardinal) undertook to continue the work and published two more volumes (VIII-IX, 1887–90); which carry the history of the Councils to the opening of the Council of Trent. Hergenröther is the fourth great church historian of Catholic Germany. His ''Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte'' (3 vols., Freiburg im B., 1876–80; 3rd ed., 1884-6; 4th ed., revised by [[Johann Peter Kirsch|J. P. Kirsch]], 1902 sqq.) exhibits vast erudition and won recognition, even from Protestants as the most independent and instructive Catholic Church history. In recent years smaller, but scholarly compendia have been written by Brück, Krause Funk, Knöpfler, Marx, and Weiss. Numerous periodicals of a scientific nature bear evidence to the vigorous activity at present displayed in the field of ecclesiastical history, e. g. the "Kirchengeschichtliche Studien" (Münster), the "Quellen und Forschungen aus dem Gebiet der Geschichte" (Paderborn), the "Forschungen zur christlichen Literatur- und Dogmengeschichte" (Mainz and Paderborn), the "Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchenhistorischen Seminar München".

====France====
In France the study of church history was long in attaining the high standard it reached in the 17th century. Two extensive narratives of general church history appeared. That of Rohrbacher is the better, "Histoire universelle de l'Église catholique" (Nancy, 1842-9). It exhibits little independent research, but is a diligently executed work, and the author made a generous and skilful use of the best and most recent literature (new ed. with continuation by Guillaume, Paris, 1877). The second work is by [[Darras]] (q. v.). In recent years the science of ecclesiastical history has made great progress in France, both as to genuine criticism and thorough scholarly narrative. The critical tendency, aroused and sustained principally by Louis Duchesne, continues to flourish and inspires very important works, particularly in special ecclesiastical history. Among the writings of Duchesne the "Histoire ancienne de l'Église" (2 vols., already issued, Paris, 1906-) deserves particular mention. Another important publication is the "Bibliothèque de l'enseignement de l'histoire ecclésiastique" a series of monographs by different authors, of which fourteen volumes have so far appeared (Paris, 1896-), and some have gone through several editions. A very useful manual is Marion's "Histoire de l'Église" (Paris, 1906).

====Belgium====
The Bollandist [[de Smedt]] wrote an "Introductio generalis in Historiam ecclesiasticam critice tractandam" (Louvain, 1876). A manual of church history was published by Wouters ("Compendium hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Louvain, 1874), who also wrote "Dissertationes in selecta capita hist. eccl." (6 vols. Louvain, 1868–72). Jungmann dealt with general church history to the end of the 18th century in his "Dissertationes selectæ in historiam ecclesiasticam". The character of ecclesiastico-historical studies at Louvain is seen in the "[[Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique]]" edited by [[Alfred Cauchie|Cauchie]] and [[Paulin Ladeuze|Ladeuze]].

====Italy====
Some manuals appeared in Italy in church history, e. g. Delsignore, "Institutiones histor. eccles.", edited by Tissani (4 vols., Rome, 1837–46); Palma, "Prælectiones hist. eccl." (4 vols., Rome, 1838–46); Prezziner, Storia della Chiesa (9 vols., Florence, 1822-); Ign. Mozzoni, "Prolegomena alla storia universale della chiesa" (Florence, 1861), and "Tavole chronologiche critiche della storia universale della chiesa" (Venice 1856-). Balan published as a continuation of Rohrbacher's universal ecclesiastical history the "Storia della chiesa dall' anno 1846 sino ai giorni nostri" (3 vols., Turin, 1886). Special works of great value were produced in various departments, above all by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in Christian archæology. However, certain recent works on general church history—e. g. Amelli, "Storia della chiesa" (2 vols., Milan, 1877); Taglialatelá, "Lezioni di storia eccles. e di archeologia cristiana" (4 vols., Naples, 1897); Pighi, "Inst. hist. eccl.", I (Verona, 1901) -- do not come up to the present standard, at any rate, from the standpoint of methodical and critical treatment.

====Spain====
The ecclesiastical history of Spain inspired two major works, one by Villanueva ("Viage literario a las iglesias de España", Madrid, 1803–21; 1850-2), the other by de la Fuente ("Historia ecclesiastica de España", 2nd ed., 2 vols., Madrid, 1873-5). In the field of general history, only Amat's "Historia ecclesiastica o tratado de la Iglesia de Jesu Christo" (12 vols., Madrid, 1793–1803, 2nd ed. 1807) appeared—not a very thorough work. Juan Manuel de Berriozobal wrote "Historia de la Iglesia en sus primos siglos" (4 vols., Madrid, 1867). The Dominican Francisco Rivaz y Madrazo published a manual ("Curso de historia ecclesiastica", 3 vols., 3rd ed., Madrid, 1905).

====Netherlands====
The first scientific Catholic manual of church history in Dutch was written by Albers ("Handboek der algemeene Kerkgeschiedenis", 2 vols., Nijmegen, 1905-7; 2nd ed., 1908).

====England====
Special ecclesiastical history can point to a multitude of English works.&lt;ref&gt;Among Catholic productions may be noted Lingard's "History of England" and his "History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church", which are works of reference for early and medieval English ecclesiastical history; Butler's "Historical Memoirs of English, Irish and Scottish Catholics since the Reform" (London, 1819; with [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]]'s "Supplementary Memoirs", London, 1820); Flanagan's "History of the Church of England" (2 vols., London, 1850); Reeve's "Short View of the History of the Church". The post-Reformation period is treated in [[Charles Dodd]], "Church History of England, 1500-1688" (ed. Tierney, 5 vols., London, 1839). Other works are [[Joseph Gillow]]'s "Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics since the Reformation", Allies' "The Formation of Christendom", Digby's "Mores Catholici, or Ages of Faith".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
A brief Catholic general account of the history of the Church in Scotland is that of T. Walsh, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (1876). That of  [[Alphons Bellesheim]] has a full bibliography, translated into English by Dom Hunter-Blair, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (4 vols., London, 1887, sqq.). A non-Catholic work is Calderwood's "History of the Kirk" (8 vols., Edinburgh, 1842).

====Ireland====
The first major Catholic work on the general ecclesiastical history of Ireland was that of Lanigan, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (4 vols., 2nd ed., Dublin, 1829), reaching only to the beginning of the 13th century. A single volume work is that of the Franciscan [[Michael John Brenan]], "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (2nd edition, Dublin, 1864).&lt;ref&gt;Works dealing with particular epochs and aspects of Irish history: [[Arthur West Haddan]] and [[William Stubbs]], ''Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland'' (London, 1873); [[William Maziere Brady]], "The Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, 1400-1873" (Rome, 1876); [[James Ware (historian)|James Ware]] and [[Walter Harris (historian)|Walter Harris]], "History of the Bishops, Antiquities, and Writers of Ireland" (non-Catholic, 3 vols., Dublin, 1739-1845); [[Sylvester Malone]], "Church History of Ireland from the Anglo-Norman Invasion to the Reformation" (Dublin, 1882); O'Hanlon's "Lives of the Irish Saints"; Killen, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (Presbyterian, London, 1875). Good Catholic accounts of the early Irish Church are those of Greith (Freiburg, 1867), Moran (Dublin, 1864), Gargan (Dublin, 1864), Salmon (Dublin, 1900). Protestant views were set forth by Stokes, "Ireland and the Celtic Church to 1172" (London, 1886), Loofs (1882), and Zimmer (1907). For a good bibliography of Irish ecclesiastical history see Bellesheim, "Gesch. der kathol. Kirche in Irland" (3 vols., Mains, 1890-).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
A learned documentary work is that of [[John Gilmary Shea]], "History of the Catholic Church in the United States" (4 vols., New York, 1886). O'Gorman's, "A History of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States" (New York, 1895), contains a useful bibliography.

====Australia====
For Australia see [[Cardinal Moran]]'s "History of the Catholic Church in Australasia" (Sydney, 1896).

===Protestant Church historians===
Among Protestants, Church history was cultivated chiefly by German Lutherans; their works came to be authoritative among non-Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, the first important Protestant ecclesiastical historian of the 19th century, exhibits the influence of the rationalism of the preceding age, but exhibits also more solidity and more Christian sentiment both in his special works on the history of Protestant theology, and in his important "Geschichte der christlichkirchlichen Gesellschaftsverfassung" (5 vols., Hanover, 1803-9). Neander is superior to him in talents and erudition, and moreover retains belief in the supernatural. His "Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche" (5 vols., Hamburg, 1825-45) reaches to the end of the 13th century; after his death a sixth volume (to the Council of Basle) was added (1852). He also wrote a history of the Apostolic epoch, "Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen Kirche durch die Apostel" (2 vols., Hamburg, 1832-). To his school belong Guericke ("Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Halle, 1833; 9th ed., Leipzig, 1865-), {{ill|Justus Ludwig Jacobi|lt=Jacobi|de}} (''Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte'', Berlin, 1850), Schaff ("Geschichte der alten Kirche", Leipzig, 1867), Niedner ("Gesch. der christl. Kirche", Leipzig, 1846). They are stricter Lutherans however. A different method is followed by Dante ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 2 vols., Jena, 1818-26); the text is brief and condensed, but is fortified by lengthy excerpts from the sources. A similar plan is followed by Gieseler ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols., Bonn, 1824-57; a sixth volume was added by Redepenning from the author's manuscript). Other manuals were written by Engelhardt (3 vols., Erlangen, 1832, with a volume of sources, 1834) and Kurtz ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Mitau, 1849). Lindner's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" (3 vols., Leipzig, 1848-54) is strictly Lutheran; less biased are Hasse ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 parts, Leipzig, 1864) and Herzog ("Abriss der gesammten Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Erlangen, 1876, sq.). Hase's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" and "Kirchengeschichte" are moderate in views, though frankly anti-Catholic. His diction is elegant, and his character-sketches finely drawn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Protestant school is more in sympathy with Semler's views. Its first leaders were the so-called "Neo-Tübingen School" under [[Johann Christian Baur]], whose ecclesiastico-historical writings are directly anti-Christian: "Das Christentum und die Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte" (Tübingen, 1853); "Die christliche Kirche vom 4. bis zum 6. Jahrhundert" (Tübingen, 1859); "Die christliche Kirche des Mittelalters" (Tübingen, 1860); "Die neuere Zeit" (Tübingen, 1861-3); "Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert" (Tübingen, 1863–73). Baur himself and his rationalistic adherents, Schwegler, Ritsçhl, Rothe, wrote also special works on the origins of the Church. The "Allgemeine Kirchengeschichte" of Gfrörer (7 parts, Stuttgart, 1841), written prior to his conversion, is a product of this spirit. Though constantly attacked, this school, whose chief representative was [[Adolf Harnack]], predominated in German Protestantism. [[Wilhelm Möller|Möller]], in his "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" writes with moderation; similarly {{ill|Karl Müller (theologian)|lt=Müller|de|Karl Müller (Theologe)}} in his "Kirchengeschichte" (Tübingen, 1892, sqq.).

In the 19th century also the Reformed (see above) produced less in the province of general church history than the Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;Among the German authors must be named: Thym, "Historische Entwicklung der Schicksäle der Kirche Christi" (2 vols., Berlin, 1800-); Munscher, "Lehrbuch der christl. Kirchengeschichte" (Marburg, 1801); Ebrard, "Handbuch der Kirchen- und Dogmengeschichte" (4 vols., Erlangen, 1865-); the most important of the Reformed Church historians is Hagenbach, "Kirchengeschichte" who is temperate in his criticism of the Catholic Middle Ages. Among the Reformed Church historians of France must be mentioned: Matter, "Histoire du christianisme et de la société chrétienne" (4 vols., Strasburg, 1829); Potter "Histoire du christianisme" (8 vols., Paris, 1856); Et. Chastel, "Histoire du christianisme depuis son origine jusqu'à nos jours" (5 vols., Paris, 1881-3); Pressensé, "Histoire des trois premiers siècles"; d'Aubigné, "Histoire de la reformation du 16&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt; siècle" (Paris, 1831-). The Netherlands produced: Hofstede de Groot, "Institutiones histor. eccles." (Groningen, 1835); Royaards, "Compendium hist. eccl. christ." (Utrecht, 1841-45).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important general ecclesiastical history produced by Anglican scholars was edited by W. Stephens and W. Hunt -- "A History of the English Church" by various writers (Hunt, Stephens, Capes, Gairdner, Hutton, Overton).&lt;ref&gt;An exhaustive history of the period since the Reformation is that of Dixon, "History of the Church of England since 1529" (5 vols., 1878-1902). In his "Lollardy and the Reformation in England" (2 vols., London, 1908), Dr. James Gairdner gives an able and impartial account of the genesis of the Reformation in England. A very useful work is the "Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines during the first eight centuries", edited by. William Smith and H. Wace (4 vols., London, 1879-). We might also mention the "History of the Christian Church" by Canon James Robertson of Canterbury, reaching to 1517; C. Wordsworth's "Church History" (4 vols., London, 1885), and the "History of the Christian Church" by Schaff (6 vols., New York, 1882-1909). Other Protestant histories are: [[Charles Hardwick]]'s "History of the Christian Church, Middle Age" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1872), and "Reformation" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1873); French's "Lectures on Medieval Church History" (London, 1877); Milman's "History of Latin Christianity to Nicholas V, 1455" (revised ed., London, 1866); Philip Smith's "History of the Christian Church to the end of the Middle Ages" (New York, 1885); George P. Fisher's "History of the Christian Church" (New York, 1887). Fair and impartial in many ways is Wakeman's "Introduction to the Church History of England" (3rd ed., London, 1907). To these may be added James Murdock's translation of Mosheim's "Institutes" (New York, 1854), and Henry B. Smith's translation of Gieseler's "History of the Church" (New York, 1857-80). For the sources of English Church history in general see Gross, "The Sources of English History to 1489" (New York, 1900), and Gardiner and Mullinger, "Introduction to the Study of English History" (latest ed., London, 1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Orthodox writers===
Greek Orthodox writers produced two works of general Church history: the ''Historia Ekklesiastike'' by Diomedes Kyriakus (2 vols., Athens, 1882), and the ''Ekklesiastike historia apo Iesou Christou mechri ton kath hemas chronon'' by Philaretes Bapheides (Constantinople, 1884-).

{{Deepwater Horizon oil spill series}}
This article covers the effect of the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' disaster]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|resulting oil spill]] on global and national economies and the energy industry.

Weeks after the event, and while it was still in progress, the 2010 ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill was being discussed as a disaster with far reaching consequences sufficient to impact global economies, marketplaces and policies. It took place on April 20, 2010. These potentially included structural shifts to [[energy policy]], insurance marketplaces and [[risk assessment]], and potential liabilities of the order of tens of billions of US dollars for one or more large and well known companies - principally [[BP]].

==Impact to the global industry==

===Oil industry impact===
{{Main|United States offshore drilling debate|2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium}}
{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}
As a response to the disaster, on 30 April President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed&lt;ref name="bloomberg010510"/&gt; and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.&lt;ref name="CBS/AP"/&gt;  Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="CITEREFupstream2010a"/&gt;  The moratorium suspended work on 33&amp;nbsp;rigs.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case [[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]], lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; The Department of Justice appealed to the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-240"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-241"/&gt;

[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|250px|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2012]]
On 30 June, Salazar said that "he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium".&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; [[Michael Bromwich]], the head of the newly created [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], said that a record of "bad performance, deadly performance" by an oil company should be considered "a relevant factor" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of "extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations".&lt;ref name=upstream300610b/&gt;

On 28 April, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.&lt;ref name="canadian regulator response"/&gt;  Five days later, the Canadian [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Jim Prentice]] said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects.&lt;ref name="prentice"/&gt;  On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].&lt;ref name="CSM20100503"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20100503"/&gt;  On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-243"/&gt;

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that in 2010, 23.5% of [[Oil producing countries|U.S. oil production]] came from offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;ref name="AutoBB-244"/&gt;  The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on [[List of countries by oil imports|imported oil]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-245"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-246"/&gt;  American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970&lt;ref name="AutoBB-247"/&gt; to 66% in 2008.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-248"/&gt;

Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.&lt;ref name="CSM Sasser"/&gt;

===Global insurance and reinsurance market impact===

At the time of the disaster it was said that there were only 4 companies able to insure risks of such size.&lt;ref name="portfolio.com1"/&gt;  The impact of ''Deepwater Horizon'' on [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]] and other global markets due to the shift in [[systemic risk]] is as yet unknown. Until this incident loss of an entire semi-submersible rig in this way was considered "an unprecedented tragedy" &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt; with an underwriter at Pritchard Capital commenting "It's never happened that a semi could burn into the sea and completely sink. Now underwriters have to include that as a risk. That’s probably $10,000 to $15,000 more per day in rig insurance. They’ll make it up by charging more on a per-rig basis." &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt;

==Impact on the UK economy==

The [[Organization for International Investment]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based advocate for overseas investment into the U.S., warned in early July that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster is potentially damaging the reputation of all British companies with operations in the U.S.&lt;ref name=guardian140710/&gt; and sparked a wave of U.S. protectionism that has restricted British firms from; winning government contracts, making political donations, and lobbying.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-286"/&gt;

==Impact on the US economy==

===Fisheries===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|thumb|As of 21 June 2010, the area closed to fishing encompassed {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or about 36% of Gulf of Mexico federal waters.|alt=21 June 2010 NOAA map of the Gulf of Mexico showing the areas closed to fishing.]]
In BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that "it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur" and "no adverse activities are anticipated" to fisheries or fish habitat.&lt;ref name="Initial Exploration Plan Mississippi Canyon"/&gt;  On 29 April 2010, [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name="state of emergency"/&gt;  An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far.&lt;ref name=CITEREFbbc2010a/&gt;  By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref name=fishing1/&gt;  On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of [[oyster]] and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-198"/&gt;  The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-199"/&gt;

On 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated {{convert|6814|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-201"/&gt;  By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Bay]], Louisiana to [[Panama City, Florida]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-203"/&gt;  On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-204"/&gt;  Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="fishing1" /&gt;

On 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in {{convert|8000|sqmi}}, leaving {{convert|78597|sqmi}} with no fishing allowed,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-205"/&gt; or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include "concerning levels of contaminants".&lt;ref name=Skoloff/&gt;  On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a {{convert|8000|sqmi}} area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-206"/&gt;

On 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-207"/&gt;

According to the [[European Space Agency]], the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-208"/&gt;

The waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-209"/&gt; but on 24 November NOAA re-closed {{convert|4200|sqmi}} area to shrimping.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-210"/&gt;  A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-211"&gt;[http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/local_news/gulf-seafood-safe%3F-experts-disagree-wptv1290203315314 Gulf seafood safe?

This was the twelfth and final reopening in federal waters since 22 July, and opened all the formerly closed areas in Federal waters.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-214"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110420081520.htm |title=All U.S. federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico once closed to fishing due to spill now open |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowable levels for the toxins in Gulf seafood are based on health impacts for a 176-pound adult eating less than 2 medium shrimp per day.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-215"&gt;{{cite web|author=AlterNet / By Lisa Kaas Boyle |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/155032/eyeless_shrimp_and_fish_with_tumors%3A_the_horrific_consequences_of_bp%27s_spill?page=entire |title=Eyeless Shrimp and Fish With Tumors: The Horrific Consequences of BP's Spill |publisher=AlterNet |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 BP released a report&lt;ref name="AutoBB-216"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515155758/http://gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that "crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill".  Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. "The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn," said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. "It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-217"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |title=Fishermen angry as BP pushes to end payments for future losses &amp;#124; wwltv.com New Orleans |publisher=Wwltv.com |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920150119/http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover.  One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week.  Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisiana fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, "If we're very lucky."  Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and "If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-218"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/20123571723894800.html Gulf fisheries in decline after oil disaster - Features - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, [[SBP (nonprofit organization)]] began to provide assistance to fishermen affected by what came to be known as the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref name="climatechange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandberg|first1=L.

===Tourism===
[[File:Orange Beach Do Not Swim sign walkway.JPG|thumb|right|Sign in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]] advising against swimming due to the oil spill]]
Although many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary for the Louisiana Office of Tourism, called the occupancy numbers misleading, but not surprising. "Because of the oil slick, the hotels are completely full of people dealing with that problem," he said. "They're certainly not coming here as tourists. People aren't sport fishing, they aren't buying fuel at the marinas, they aren't staying at the little hotels on the coast and eating at the restaurants."&lt;ref name="thesunnews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|title=Spill hasn't yet emptied hotels on Gulf Coast|last=Reed|first=Travis|work=The Sun News|agency=Associated Press|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530120501/http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|archivedate=30 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May, BP gave Florida $25&amp;nbsp;million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15&amp;nbsp;million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought [[digital billboard]]s showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]]. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.&lt;ref name="thesunnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/04/1511778/oil-could-hit-strand-by-july.html|title=Oil could hit Myrtle Beach area by July|last=Anderson|first=Lorena|work=The Sun News |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-219"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |title=Big price tag for recovery of Gulf Coast |last=Proctor |first=Carleton |work=Pensacola News Journal |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427044922/http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-220"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |title=Potential Impact of the Gulf Oil Spill on Tourism |author=Oxford Economics |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507030043/http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate prices===
The real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow [[property tax]] to be paid based on current market value, which according to Florida [[Florida Legislature|State Rep.]] [[Dave Murzin]] could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-225"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |title=Gulf property sales slide further on oil fears |last=Farrington |first=Brendan |work=The Sun News |agency=Associated Press |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154922/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP's expenditures on the oil spill===
On 5 July 2010, BP reported that its own expenditures on the oil spill had reached $3.12&amp;nbsp;billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs.&lt;ref name="BP costs for oil spill response pass $3 billion"&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press| title= BP costs for oil spill response pass $3&amp;nbsp;billion|last= Breen|first= Tom|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=2010-07-05| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/5/bp-costs-oil-spill-response-pass-3-billion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1 October 2010, BP has spent $11.2 billion.&lt;ref name="newsobserver.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc011010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100101380.html |title=BP says oil spill costs rise to $11.2 billion |last=Wardell|first=Jane|agency= The Associated Press| newspaper = The Washington Post |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, BP estimated the company's total spill-related expenses do not exceed $37.2 billion.&lt;ref name=settleAP&gt;{{cite news|title=BP begins to put spill behind it with settlement|first1=Jonathan|last1=Fahey|first2=Chris|last2=Kahn|date=3 March 2012|work=[[CBN News]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/46613428|accessdate=20 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]] limits BP's liability for non-cleanup costs to $75&amp;nbsp;million unless gross negligence is proven.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-221"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10543231 |first=Erica |last=Werner |title=Federal law may limit BP liability in oil spill |date=3 May 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218042243/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10543231 |archivedate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BP has said it would pay for all cleanup and remediation regardless of the statutory liability cap.

===Market value===
BP's stock fell by 51% in 40 days on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], going from $60.57 on 20 April 2010, to $29.20 on 9 June, its lowest level since August 1996. On 25 June, BP's market value reached a 1-year low. The company's total value lost since 20 April was $105&amp;nbsp;billion. Investors saw their holdings in BP shrink to $27.02, a nearly 54% loss of value in 2010.&lt;ref name="BP's stock hits new low"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Post |title=Stormy weather: BP's stock hits low and high |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-27 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/stormy_weather_bp_stock_hits_new_R9j0pMVMYMpgrQodvaymOP|first=Paul|last=Tharp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the company's loss in market value totalled $60 billion, a 35% decline since the explosion. At that time, BP reported a second-quarter loss of $17 billion, its first loss in 18 years. This included a one-time $32.2 billion charge, including $20 billion for the [[#Spill response fund|fund]] created for reparations and $2.9 billion in actual costs.&lt;ref name=Wardell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |title=BP replaces CEO Hayward, reports $17 billion loss |last=Wardell |first=Jane |agency=Associated Press |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930003010/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BP announced that it was setting up a new unit to oversee management of the oil spill and its aftermath, to be headed by former [[TNK-BP]] chief executive [[Bob Dudley|Robert Dudley]],&lt;ref name=upstream080610&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article217033.ece |title= BP calls in FPSO for Macondo |last1=Brenner |first1=Noah |last2=Pitt |first2=Anthea|newspaper=Upstream Online|publisher=NHST Media Group |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who a month later was named CEO of BP.&lt;ref name=Wardell/&gt;

On 1 October, BP's [[London Stock Exchange]] price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.&lt;ref name="abc011010"/&gt;

By 2013, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-bp-results-urgent-idUSBRE91409C20130205?irpc=932 | work=Reuters | title=Smaller BP's profits down as oil spill trial looms | date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2014, when BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which could see it liable for up to $18 billion in additional fines, the company's shares lost 6 percent of their value.&lt;ref name="BPverdict"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil sp|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''New Orleans Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drop in sale===
BP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to [[Amoco]], while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-224"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38493212/ns/business-us_business/|title=Time to scrap BP brand?

{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and "[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the "[[Big Band|Big Band era]]", "[[Disco era]]", etc.

[[File:The Golden Age (fresco by Pietro da Cortona).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Golden Age'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]] ([[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]]).]]

The term '''Golden Age'''  comes from [[Greek mythology]], particularly the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five [[Ages of Man|Ages]], [[Gold]] being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ({{Lang-el|χρύσεον γένος}} ''chrýseon génos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Hesiod]]|title=[[Works and Days]]|chapter=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived. Those living in the  first Age were ruled by [[Cronus|Kronos]], after the finish of the first age was the [[Silver age|Silver]], then the [[Bronze Age (mythology)|Bronze]], after this the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic]] age, with the fifth and current age being [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron]].&lt;ref&gt; Robin Hard - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's "Handbook of Greek Mythology"], [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=The+Golden+age+in+Greek+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3gP-h9tvTAhVLbBoKHWhQDkwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Golden%20age%20in%20Greek%20mythology&amp;f=false p.69-70], [[Psychology Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0415186366}}, Accessed 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial [[peace]], [[harmony]], [[ecological stability|stability]], and [[prosperity]]. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.

In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35–37|isbn=9780140171990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some version of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars." ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==
The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]

In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.

===Arcadia===
A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]

==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==
Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.

Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:
&lt;poem&gt;''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:
''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;'''Translation:'''
''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung
''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll
''Of circling centuries begins anew:
''Astraea returns,
''Returns old Saturn's reign,
''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.1 5-8)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:
&lt;poem&gt;
''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen
''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.
''Even this was impious; for the common stock
''They gathered, and the earth of her own will
''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni
''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125–28])&lt;/poem&gt;

This view, which identifies a [[State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:
&lt;poem&gt;
''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,
''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:
''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''
''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
''Needless was written law, where none opprest:
''The law of Man was written in his breast.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, "Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Graeco-Roman concept of the "natural man" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.&lt;ref&gt;See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on "The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Soft" and "hard" primitivism in Arcadia==
In his famous essay, "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition",&lt;ref&gt;"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition," in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, "that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Golden Ages==
There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.

The [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Satya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy".

===Brahma Kumaris===
The [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.&lt;ref name="4ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.

Golden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.

Meditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.

But perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.

Practice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.[http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/benefits-of-meditation/ The Eight Powers.]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Norse===
The [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally "Golden Age") was used in [[Völuspá]] to describe the period after [[Ragnarök]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Gimlé]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.

===Bible===
There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.

{{quote|31 "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel 2: 31-35}}

The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.

===Fantasy===
In modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.

For example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of the world]], the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the "Age of Legends" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.

Another example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.

The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

===Present-day usage===
{{See also|Golden age (metaphor)}}
The term "Golden Age" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the "[[Spanish Golden Age]]", "[[Dutch Golden Age]]", "[[Golden age of alpinism]]", "[[Golden Age of American animation]]", "[[Golden Age of Comics]]", "[[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]", "[[Golden Age of Television]]", "[[Golden Age of Hollywood]]", "[[Golden age of arcade video games]]", "[[Golden Age of Radio]]", "[[Golden age hip hop|Golden Age of Hip Hop]]" and even "[[Golden Age of Piracy]]" or "[[Golden Age of Porn]]". Usually, the term "Golden Age" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed.

'''Hegelianism''' is the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] which can be summed up by the dictum that "the [[Rationality|rational]] alone is real",&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' (1821), ''Vorrede'': ''Was vernünftig ist, das ist Wirklich; und was wirklich ist, das ist vernünftig''. ["What is rational is real; And what is real is rational."]&lt;/ref&gt; which means that all reality is capable of being expressed in rational categories.  His goal was to reduce reality to a more synthetic unity within the system of [[absolute idealism]].

==Method==
Hegel's method in philosophy consists of the triadic development (''Entwicklung'') in each concept and each thing. Thus, he hopes, philosophy will not contradict experience, but experience will give data to the philosophical, which is the ultimately true explanation. If, for instance, we wish to know what [[liberty]] is, we take that concept where we first find it—the unrestrained action of the savage, who does not feel the need of repressing any thought, feeling, or tendency to act.

Next, we find that the savage has given up this freedom in exchange for its opposite, the restraint, or, as he considers it, the [[tyranny]], of civilization and law. Finally, in the citizen under the rule of law, we find the third stage of development, namely liberty in a higher and a fuller sense than how the savage possessed it—the liberty to do, say, and think many things beyond the power of the savage.

In this triadic process, the second stage is the direct opposite, the annihilation, or at least the [[Aufheben|sublation]], of the first. The third stage is the first returned to itself in a higher, truer, richer, and fuller form. The three stages are, therefore, styled:

* in itself (''An-sich'')
* out of itself (''Anderssein'')
* in and for itself (''An-und-für-sich'').

These three stages are found succeeding one another throughout the whole realm of thought and being, from the most abstract [[logic]]al process up to the most complicated concrete activity of organized mind in the succession of states or the production of systems of philosophy.

==Doctrine of development==
In logic – which, according to Hegel, is really [[metaphysic]] – we have to deal with the process of development applied to reality in its most abstract form. According to Hegel, in logic, we deal in concepts robbed of their empirical content: in logic we are discussing the process in a vacuum, so to speak. Thus, at the very beginning of Hegel's study of reality, he finds the logical concept of being.

Now, being is not a static concept according to Hegel, as [[Aristotle]] supposed it was. It is essentially dynamic, because it tends by its very nature to pass over into nothing, and then to return to itself in the higher concept, becoming. For Aristotle, there was nothing more certain than that being equaled being, or, in other words, that being is identical with itself, that everything is what it is. Hegel does not deny this; but, he adds, it is equally certain that being tends to become its opposite, nothing, and that both are united in the concept becoming. For instance, the truth about this table, for Aristotle, is that it is a table. 

For Hegel, the equally important truth is that it was a tree, and it "will be" ashes. The whole truth, for Hegel, is that the tree became a table and will become ashes. Thus, becoming, not being, is the highest expression of reality. It is also the highest expression of thought because then only do we attain the fullest knowledge of a thing when we know what it was, what it is, and what it will be-in a word, when we know the history of its development.

In the same way as "being" and "nothing" develop into the higher concept becoming, so, farther on in the scale of development, life and mind appear as the third terms of the process and in turn are developed into higher forms of themselves. (Aristotle saw "being" as superior to "becoming", because anything which is still becoming something else is imperfect. Hence, God, for Aristotle, is perfect because He never changes, but is eternally complete.) But one cannot help asking what is it that develops or is developed?

Its name, Hegel answers, is different in each stage. In the lowest form it is "being", higher up it is "life", and in still higher form it is "mind". The only thing always present is the process (''das Werden''). We may, however, call the process by the name of "spirit" (''Geist'') or "idea" (''Begriff''). We may even call it God, because at least in the third term of every triadic development the process is God.

==Categorization of philosophies==

===Division of philosophy===
The first and most wide-reaching consideration of the process of spirit, God, or the idea, reveals to us the truth that the idea must be studied (1) in itself; this is the subject of logic or metaphysics; (2) out of itself, in nature; this is the subject of the philosophy of [[nature]]; and (3) in and for itself, as mind; this is the subject of the philosophy of [[mind]] (''Geistesphilosophie'').

===Philosophy of nature===
Passing over the rather abstract considerations by which Hegel shows in his ''Logik'' the process of the idea-in-itself through being to becoming, and finally through essence to notion, we take up the study of the development of the idea at the point where it enters into otherness in nature. In nature the idea has lost itself, because it has lost its unity and is splintered, as it were, into a thousand fragments. But the loss of unity is only apparent, because in reality the idea has merely concealed its unity.

Studied philosophically, nature reveals itself as so many successful attempts of the idea to emerge from the state of otherness and present itself to us as a better, fuller, richer idea, namely, spirit, or mind. Mind is, therefore, the goal of nature. It is also the truth of nature. For whatever is in nature is realized in a higher form in the mind which emerges from nature.

===Philosophy of mind===
The philosophy of mind begins with the consideration of the individual, or subjective, mind. It is soon perceived, however, that individual, or subjective, mind is only the first stage, the in-itself stage, of mind. The next stage is objective mind, or mind objectified in law, morality, and the State. This is mind in the condition of out-of-itself.

There follows the condition of absolute mind, the state in which mind rises above all the limitations of nature and institutions, and is subjected to itself alone in art, religion, and philosophy. For the essence of mind is [[Free will|freedom]], and its development must consist in breaking away from the restrictions imposed on it in it otherness by nature and human institutions.

===Philosophy of history===
Hegel's philosophy of the State, his theory of history, and his account of absolute mind are perhaps the most often-read portions of his philosophy due to their accessibility. The State, he says, is mind objectified. The individual mind, which (on account of its [[Passions (philosophy)|passions]], its [[prejudice]]s, and its blind [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]]s) is only partly free, subjects itself to the yoke of necessity—the opposite of freedom—in order to attain a fuller realization of itself in the freedom of the citizen.

This yoke of necessity is first met within the recognition of the rights of others, next in [[morality]], and finally in social morality, of which the primal institution is the [[family]]. Aggregates of families form [[civil society]], which, however, is but an imperfect form of organization compared with the State. The State is the perfect social embodiment of the idea, and stands in this stage of development for God Himself.

The State, studied in itself, furnishes for our consideration [[constitution]]al law. In relation to other States it develops [[international law]]; and in its general course through historical vicissitudes it passes through what Hegel calls the "Dialectics of History".

Hegel teaches that the constitution is the collective spirit of the nation and that the government and the written constitution is the embodiment of that spirit. Each nation has its own individual spirit, and the greatest of crimes is the act by which the [[tyrant]] or the conqueror stifles the spirit of a nation.

[[War]], Hegel suggests, can never be ruled out, as one can never know when or if one will occur, an example being the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic overrunning of Europe]] and its abolition of traditional Royalist systems. War represents a crisis in the development of the idea which is embodied in the different States, and out of this crisis usually the State which holds the more advanced spirit wins out, though it may also suffer a loss, lick its wounds, yet still win in the spiritual sense, as happened for example when the northerners sacked Rome — Rome's form of legality and its religion "won" out in spite of the losses on the battlefield.

A peaceful revolution is also possible (according to Hegel) when the changes required to solve a crisis are ascertained by thoughtful insight and when this insight spreads throughout the body politic: {{Quotation|
If a people [''Volk''] can no longer accept as implicitly true what its constitution expresses to it as the truth, if its consciousness or Notion and its actuality are not at one, then the people's spirit is torn asunder. Two things may then occur. First, the people may either by a supreme internal effort dash into fragments this law which still claims authority, or it may more quietly and slowly effect changes on the yet operative law, which is, however, no longer true morality, but which the mind has already passed beyond. In the second place, a people's intelligence and strength may not suffice for this, and it may hold to the lower law; or it may happen that another nation has reached its higher constitution, thereby rising in the scale, and the first gives up its nationality and becomes subject to the other. Therefore it is of essential importance to know what the true constitution is; for what is in opposition to it has no stability, no truth, and passes away. It has a temporary existence, but cannot hold its ground; it has been accepted, but cannot secure permanent acceptance; that it must be cast aside, lies in the very nature of the constitution. This insight can be reached through Philosophy alone. Revolutions take place in a state without the slightest violence when the insight becomes universal; institutions, somehow or other, crumble and disappear, each man agrees to give up his right. A government must, however, recognize that the time for this has come; should it, on the contrary, knowing not the truth, cling to temporary institutions, taking what&amp;nbsp;— though recognized&amp;nbsp;— is unessential, to be a bulwark guarding it from the essential (and the essential is what is contained in the Idea), that government will fall, along with its institutions, before the force of mind. The breaking up of its government breaks up the nation itself; a new government arises,&amp;nbsp;— or it may be that the government and the unessential retain the upper hand.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', vol. II, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The "ground" of historical development is, therefore, rational; since the State, if it is not in contradiction, is the embodiment of reason as spirit. Many, at first considered to be contingent events of history, can become, in reality or in necessity, stages in the logical unfolding of the sovereign reason which gets embodied in an advanced State. Such a "necessary contingency" when expressed in passions, impulse, interest, character, personality, get used by the "cunning of reason", which, in retrospect, was to its own purpose.

====Stages of history====
We are, therefore, to understand historical happenings as the stern, reluctant working of reason towards the full realization of itself in perfect freedom. Consequently, we must interpret history in rational terms, and throw the succession of events into logical categories and this interpretation is, for Hegel, a mere inference from actual history.

Thus the widest view of history reveals three most important stages of development: 

* Oriental [[Empire|imperial]] (the stage of oneness, of suppression of freedom)
* Greek [[social democracy]] (the stage of expansion, in which freedom was lost in unstable [[demagogy]])
* Christian [[constitutional monarchy]] (which represents the reintegration of freedom in [[constitutional government]])

===Philosophy of absolute mind===
Even in the State, mind is limited by subjection to other minds. There remains the final step in the process of the acquisition of freedom, namely, that by which absolute mind in [[art]], [[religion]], and philosophy subjects itself to itself alone. In art, mind has the intuitive contemplation of itself as realized in the art material, and the development of the arts has been conditioned by the ever-increasing "[[docile|docility]]" with which the art material lends itself to the actualization of mind or the idea.

In religion, mind feels the superiority of itself to the particularizing limitations of finite things. Here, as in the philosophy of history, there are three great moments, [[Oriental religion]], which exaggerated the idea of the infinite, [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], which gave undue importance to the finite, and [[Christianity]], which represents the union of the infinite and the finite. Last of all, absolute mind, as philosophy, transcends the limitations imposed on it even in religious feeling, and, discarding representative intuition, attains all truth under the form of reason.

Whatever truth there is in art and in religion is contained in philosophy, in a higher form, and free from all limitations. Philosophy is, therefore, "the highest, freest and wisest phase of the union of subjective and objective mind, and the ultimate goal of all development."

==Influence==
The far reaching influence of Hegel is due in a measure to the undoubted vastness of the scheme of philosophical synthesis which he conceived and partly realized. A philosophy which undertook to organize under the single formula of triadic development every department of knowledge, from abstract logic up to the philosophy of history, has a great deal of attractiveness to those who are metaphysically inclined. But Hegel's influence is due in a still larger measure to two extrinsic circumstances.

His philosophy is the highest expression of that spirit of collectivism which characterized the nineteenth century.  In [[theology]] especially Hegel revolutionized the methods of inquiry. The application of his notion of development to [[Bible|Biblical]] criticism and to historical investigation is obvious to anyone who compares the spirit and purpose of contemporary theology with the spirit and purpose of the theological literature of the first half of the nineteenth century.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In science, too, and in literature, the substitution of the category of becoming for the category of being is a very patent fact, and is due to the influence of Hegel's method. In political [[Economics|economy]] and [[political science]] the effect of Hegel's collectivistic conception of the State supplanted to a large extent the individualistic conception which was handed down from the eighteenth century to the nineteenth century.

{{main|Hegelian Rightists|Young Hegelians}}

Hegel's philosophy became known outside Germany from the 1820s onwards, and Hegelian schools developed in northern Europe, Italy, France, Eastern Europe, America and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]] (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G05h3H0Zq7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Hegelianism&amp;f=false Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'', Routledge, 2013, "Hegelianism".&lt;/ref&gt; These schools are collectively known as '''post-Hegelian philosophy''', '''post-Hegelian idealism''' or simply '''post-Hegelianism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pinkard, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GBu-Mvg1-FkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false German Philosophy 1760-1860: The Legacy of Idealism]'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Germany===

Hegel's immediate followers in Germany are generally divided into the "[[Right Hegelians]]" and the "[[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]]" (the latter also referred to as the "Young Hegelians").

The Rightists developed his philosophy along lines which they considered to be in accordance with Christian theology. They included [[Johann Philipp Gabler]], [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]], and [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]].

The Leftists accentuated the anti-Christian tendencies of Hegel's system and developed schools of [[materialism]], [[socialism]], [[rationalism]], and [[pantheism]]. They included [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Bruno Bauer]], and [[David Strauss]]. [[Max Stirner]] socialized with the left Hegelians but built his own philosophical system largely opposing that of these thinkers.

===Other nations===
{{also|Neo-Hegelianism}}

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Hegelianism was represented during the nineteenth century by, and largely overlapped the [[British Idealist]] school of [[James Hutchison Stirling]], [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[William Wallace (Scottish philosopher)|William Wallace]], [[John Caird (theologian)|John Caird]], [[Edward Caird]], [[Richard Lewis Nettleship]], [[F. H. Bradley]], and [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].

In [[Denmark]], Hegelianism was represented by [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] from the 1820s to the 1850s.

In mid-19th century [[Italy]], Hegelianism was represented by [[Bertrando Spaventa]].

Hegelianism in [[North America]] was represented by [[Friedrich August Rauch]] and [[William T. Harris]], as well as the [[St. Louis Hegelians]]. In its most recent form it seems to take its inspiration from [[Thomas Hill Green]], and whatever influence it exerts is opposed to the prevalent pragmatic tendency.

In [[Poland]], Hegelianism was represented by Karol Libelt, August Cieszkowski and [[Józef Kremer]].

[[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Étienne Vacherot]] were the leading Hegelians towards the end of the nineteenth century in [[Italy]] and [[France]], respectively. Among [[Catholic]] philosophers who were influenced by Hegel the most prominent were [[Georg Hermes]] and [[Anton Günther]].

Hegelianism also inspired [[Giovanni Gentile]]'s philosophy of [[actual idealism]] and [[fascism]], the concept that people are motivated by ideas and that social change is brought by the leaders.

Hegelianism spread to [[Imperial Russia]] through [[St. Petersburg]] in the 1840s, and was – as other intellectual waves were – considered an absolute truth amongst the intelligentsia, until the arrival of [[Darwinism]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orlando Figes]], ''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891–1924'', The Bodley Head (2014), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Žižek]] is considered to be a contemporary post-Hegelian philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Bostjan Nedoh (ed.), ''Lacan and Deleuze: A Disjunctive Synthesis'', Edinburgh University Press, 2016, p. 193: "Žižek is convinced that post-Hegelian psychoanalytic drive theory is both compatible with and even integral to a Hegelianism reinvented for the twenty-first century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Barn, Old Moscow Highway, Pullman, Whitman County, WA HABS WASH,38-PULL.V,1-5.tif|thumb|An example of a heritage barn photographed for the Historic American Building Survey (HABS), the T. A. Leonard Barn, Old Moscow Highway, Pullman, Whitman County, WA HABS WASH,38-PULL.V,1-5]]

A '''Heritage Barn''' or "Historic Barn" is a [[barn]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] that is deemed a cultural landmark due to its unique historic character.  The determination of "heritage barn" status is a generalized term that some have used to describe historic barns and historic farm properties that are listed on the National Register for Historic Places using the [[National Register of Historic Places#Nomination process|criteria set forth by the Secretary of the Interior]]. As with all [[Historic Preservation]] efforts, heritage barns are encouraged, but not required, to be working buildings.

==Definition==
Because barns vary widely in style, size, materials, purpose and architecture, most legal definitions remain open ended. A few [[U.S. state]]s have legislation defining heritage barns. One legal definition of Heritage Barns comes from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. The [[Washington State Legislature|Substitute House Bill 2115 from the 2007 Regular Legislative Session]] defined Heritage Barns as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
any large agricultural outbuilding used to house animals, crops, or farm equipment, that is over fifty years old and has been determined by the department to: &lt;br/&gt;
(a) Be eligible for listing on the Washington heritage register or the national register of historic places; or &lt;br/&gt;
(b) have been listed on a local historic register and approved by the advisory council. &lt;br/&gt;
In addition to barns, "heritage barn" includes agricultural resources such as milk houses, sheds, silos, or other outbuildings, that are historically associated with the working life of the farm or ranch, if these outbuildings are on the same property as a heritage barn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/2115-S.PL.pdf Substitute House Bill 2115: Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of this bill was to establish a Heritage Barn Preservation Grant Program, administered through the [http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/HistoricSites/HeritageBarnRegister.htm Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/2115-S.PL.pdf Substitute House Bill 2115: Purpose]&lt;/ref&gt;

American standards of preservation generally require that a building, structure, or object be 50 years or older before it may be considered historic; however, resources that have earned cultural significance within the last 50 years may also be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Preservation Status==

===Registers===
In the United States, historic barns are often part of a larger preservation effort, and each state deals with them as they do other historic properties like bridges, courthouses, and various sites of cultural significance - through their [[State Historic Preservation Office]] and various historic preservation programs at both the state and local levels. However, there are cases of concentrated preservation efforts aimed at protecting historic agricultural resources. The National Barn Alliance, a non-profit group that aims to preserve and protect America's historic barns and rural heritage, maintains a state-by-state guide that details many such efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State-by-State Barn Survey &amp; Agricultural Study Guide|url=http://barnalliance.org/resources/barn-survey/state-by-state-barn-survey-agricultural-study-guide/|publisher=www.barnalliance.org|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific example of a statewide register specifically for heritage barns is found in Washington State [http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/HistoricSites/documents/ListedBarns_002.pdf Heritage Barn Register] through the state Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, created by their legislature in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Heritage Barn Register was a response to the preliminary findings of a Heritage Barn Survey conducted in 2007, which found an enormous inventory of historic barns, including many with physical needs.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;[http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/HistoricSites/documents/HeritageBarnReport.pdf Heritage Barn Report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 alone, 292 Heritage Barns were listed on this special register.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

===Preservation Grants===
In some states, funding is available to heritage barns through Preservation grant programs administered through State Historic Preservation Offices, including the [[Preserve America]] grants program, the [[Save America's Treasures]] grants program, as well as individual state preservation grants. Increasingly, state's provide or have provided funding specifically for heritage barns; however, funding assistance for privately owned historic barns remains primarily the responsibility of the property owner. Currently, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Connecticut]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Iowa]], [[Montana]], [[Maryland]] and [[Michigan]] provide grants in various forms.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

Some state and local barn preservation groups, like the Iowa Barn Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Iowa Barn Foundation's 2016 Spring Tour will explore historic barns in Dubuque County|url=http://www.iowabarnfoundation.org/|publisher=Iowa Barn Foundation|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansas Barn Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas State Historical Society - Grants &amp; Loans|url=http://www.kansasbarnalliance.org/barnaidgrants.php|publisher=www.kansasbarnalliance.org|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan Barn Preservation Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Appreciation, Preservation, and Rehabilitation of Michigan Barns, Farmsteads, and Rural Communities;  Established 1995|url=http://www.mibarn.net/|publisher=www.mibarn.net|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Preservation Trust of Vermont have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding for Historic Preservation through the Preservation Trust of Vermont|url=http://www.ptvermont.org/help/preservation_grants.php|publisher=www.ptvermont.org|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed small grants to assist in obtaining skilled and experienced barn contractors to aid in barn preservation.

'''''David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt''''' is a case in [[English law]] against American author [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and her publisher [[Penguin Books]], filed in the [[High Court of Justice]] by the British author [[David Irving]] in 1996, asserting that Lipstadt had [[libel]]led him in her book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]''. The court ruled that Irving's claim of libel relating to [[English defamation law]] and [[Holocaust denial]] was not valid because Lipstadt's claim that he had deliberately distorted evidence had been shown to be [[substantially true]]. English libel law puts the burden of proof on the defence, meaning that it was up to Lipstadt and her publisher to prove that her claims of Irving's deliberate misrepresentation of evidence to conform to his ideological viewpoints were substantially true.

Lipstadt hired British lawyer [[Anthony Julius]] while Penguin hired libel experts Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of media law firm [[Davenport Lyons]]. [[Richard J. Evans]], an established historian, was hired by the defence to serve as an expert witness. Evans spent two years examining Irving's work, and presented evidence of Irving's misrepresentations, including evidence that Irving had knowingly used forged documents as source material. Upon mutual agreement,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 47&lt;/ref&gt; the case was argued as a [[bench trial]] before [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr. Justice Gray]], who produced a written judgment 349 pages long in favour of the defendants, in which he detailed Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of the Holocaust and Hitler's role therein.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Denying the holocaust.jpg|thumb|right|Lipstadt's book: ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'']] --&gt;

In 1993, [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] published Professor [[Deborah Lipstadt]]'s book ''[[Denying the Holocaust|Denying the Holocaust: the Growing Assault on Truth and Memory]]''.&lt;ref name=publishing&gt;The book was first published in America in 1993 ({{ISBN|9780029192351}}) by Free Press, a division of Simon and Schuster. It was republished in the United Kingdom in 1994 ({{ISBN|9780452272743}}) by Plume, a division of Penguin – whom Irving sued.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name = OriginalBook&gt;[[#Lipstadt1994|Lipstadt (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In it she described and condemned the phenomenon of [[Holocaust denial]] and referred to [[David Irving]] as a prominent Holocaust denier. One of the passages Irving later objected to was:

{{quote|Irving is one of the most dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial. Familiar with historical evidence, he bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda. A man who is convinced that Britain's great decline was accelerated by its decision to go to war with Germany, he is most facile at taking accurate information and shaping it to confirm his conclusions. A review of his recent book, ''Churchill's War'', which appeared in ''New York Review of Books'', accurately analyzed his practice of applying a [[double standard]] of evidence. He demands "absolute documentary proof" when it comes to proving the Germans guilty, but he relies on highly circumstantial evidence to condemn the Allies. This is an accurate description not only of Irving's tactics, but of those of deniers in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt1994|Lipstadt (1994)]], page 181&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1994, Irving had his first encounter with Lipstadt at [[DeKalb College]] in [[Atlanta]], where Lipstadt was lecturing on Holocaust denial. Irving had listened to the lecture while sitting in the lecture hall and when it was over, did his best to disrupt Lipstadt by challenging her to a debate, waving about a large amount of money in his hands and announcing he had $1,000 to give to her or anyone who could find a written order from Hitler for the Holocaust. Lipstadt ignored Irving, despite his repeated attempts to draw her into a debate. After Lipstadt's lecture had ended, Irving announced that Lipstadt's refusal to debate him or produce a written order from Hitler for the Holocaust, despite his promise to pay $1,000 on the spot, proved that her criticism of him in ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' was invalid and he handed out free copies of his [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] biography to Lipstadt's students.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=39-40}}

=== Libel suits ===
[[File:David irving.jpg|thumb|left|Irving at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the National Archives of the United Kingdom]], 2003]]
On 5 September 1996, Irving filed a libel suit concerning Lipstadt's book in English court. He named in his suit Lipstadt and [[Penguin Books]], whose division [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] had published a British edition of her book.&lt;ref name=publishing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pelt2002|Pelt (2002)]], page 63&lt;/ref&gt; Irving also sued Holocaust historian [[Gitta Sereny#David Irving libel case|Gitta Sereny]] for libel for an article she had written about him entitled "Spin Time for Hitler" in ''The Observer'' newspaper on 21 April 1996, although the case did not go to court.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard page 27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spin Time for Hitler|last=Sereny|first=Gitta|date=21 April 1996|work=The Observer|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memories are made of this|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/24/historybooks.features|date=24 February 2002|newspaper=The Observer|author=Tim Adams|accessdate=28 September 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In letters of 25 and 28 October 1997, Irving threatened to sue [[John Lukacs]] for libel if he published his book, ''The Hitler of History'' without removing certain passages highly critical of Irving's work.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard page 27"&gt;[[#Evans2001|Evans (2001)]], page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The American edition of ''The Hitler of History'' was published in 1997 with the allegedly libelous passages but because of Irving's legal threats, no British edition of ''The Hitler of History'' was published until 2001.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard page 27"/&gt; When the latter was published, as a result of the threat of legal action by Irving, the passages containing the criticism of Irving's historical methods were expunged by the publisher, to the disappointment of many reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Tim | authorlink = | title = Memories are made of this | work = | publisher = Observer |date=24 February 2002 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/24/historybooks.features  | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I'm going to try to get a source for this paragraph before I reinstate it Although Irving in his letter of 25 October 1997 informed Lukacs's American publisher that he considered ''The Hitler of History'' to be libelous, he did not see fit to cross the Atlantic to launch a libel suit in the United States, perhaps because American libel law does not favour the claimant the same way British libel law does or perhaps because he already had two libel suits in his hands. --&gt;

In her book, ''Denying the Holocaust'', Lipstadt called Irving a Holocaust denier, falsifier, a bigot and that he manipulated and distorted real documents. Irving claimed to have been libelled under the grounds that Lipstadt had falsely labelled him a Holocaust denier, falsely claimed that he had falsified evidence or deliberately misinterpreted it, by which false accusations his reputation as an historian was defamed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/ Holocaust Denial and the 2000 Libel Trial in the U.K. Emory University]&lt;/ref&gt; Though the author was American, Irving filed his suit in the English High Court, where the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in libel cases is on the defendant, unlike the US where the burden is on the plaintiff. He was able to file the lawsuit in England because the book was published there (before 1996, if Irving had wished to sue Lipstadt, he would have had to launch his legal action in an American court; English libel law applies only to alleged acts of libel committed in England and Wales). As explained by the trial judge, [[Charles Gray (English judge)|Mr Justice Gray]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;4.7 ... the burden of proving the defence of justification rests upon the publishers. Defamatory words are presumed under English law to be untrue. It is not incumbent on defendants to prove the truth of every detail of the defamatory words published: what has to be proved is the substantial truth of the defamatory imputations published about the claimant. As it is sometimes expressed, what must be proved is the truth of the sting of the defamatory charges made.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Legal issues ===

Irving's decision to file his lawsuit in the English courts gave him the upper hand by shifting the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. Under [[United States defamation law|American libel law]], a [[public figure]] who claims to have been libelled must prove that the statements in question are defamatory and false, and were made with [[actual malice]] or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. Reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defence. [[English libel law]] requires only that the [[claimant]] show that the statements are defamatory. The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were [[substantially true]] and reliance on sources is irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

The statements made by Lipstadt were clearly defamatory and the defence could not claim that they were misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt31&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 31&lt;/ref&gt; If the defence could not prove the defamatory content of her words to be true, they would be found guilty of libel. Lipstadt feared that such a verdict would confer legitimacy upon Irving's claims and felt compelled to defend herself.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt31/&gt; One commenter, who had expressed the opinion that Irving "could have been ignored", later wrote "Lipstadt had no choice but to defend herself in court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan|last= Freedland|authorlink= |title=The History Men |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/0,2846,141902,00.html|work= The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date= 1 March 2000|accessdate=17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Freedland| authorlink= |title=Let's Close the Book| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/12/news.comment |work= The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date= 12 April 2000|accessdate=17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To succeed with a [[English defamation law#Justification|justification defence]], the defence would need to prove as substantially true all of the defamatory claims made by Lipstadt against Irving. The judge understood these claims to be'
{{quote|
# that Irving is an apologist for and partisan of Hitler, who has resorted to the distortion of evidence; the manipulation and skewing of documents; the misrepresentation of data and the application of double standards to the evidence, in order to serve his own purpose of exonerating Hitler and portraying him as sympathetic towards the Jews;
# that Irving is one of the most dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial, who has on numerous occasions denied that the Nazis embarked upon the deliberate planned extermination of Jews and has alleged that it is a Jewish deception that gas chambers were used by the Nazis at Auschwitz as a means of carrying out such extermination;
# that Irving, in denying that the Holocaust happened, has misstated evidence; misquoted sources; falsified statistics; misconstrued information and bent historical evidence so that it conforms to his neo-fascist political agenda and ideological beliefs;
# that Irving has allied himself with representatives of a variety of extremist and anti-semitic groups and individuals and on one occasion agreed to participate in a conference at which representatives of terrorist organisations were due to speak;
# that Irving, in breach of an agreement which he had made and without permission, removed and transported abroad certain microfiches of Goebbels's diaries, thereby exposing them to a real risk of damage.
# that Irving is discredited as an historian.&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 2.15&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Preparation ===

==== Defence ====
[[File:Deborah Lipstadt Remembering the Shoah panel.jpg|thumb|Deborah Lipstadt  (2015)]]
&lt;!-- add more stuff about how long and what stuff they all did to prepare --&gt;
Lipstadt hired the British solicitor [[Anthony Julius]] to present her case. Penguin hired [[Davenport Lyons]] libel specialists Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman. Together they briefed the libel barrister, [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior barrister. Penguin knew that they were going to have to dig deep to defend against Irving's claims. Lipstadt's claims would need to be backed up by experts and Penguin would foot the bill, retaining Professor [[Richard J. Evans]], historian and Professor of Modern History at [[Cambridge University]], as their lead witness.&lt;ref name=lipstadt42&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 42&lt;/ref&gt; As an expert witness, Evans was expected to prepare a report and to be cross-examined. Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian [[Christopher Browning]], the German historian [[Peter Longerich]], the Dutch architectural expert [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] and the Political Science Professor {{ill|Hajo Funke|de}} of the [[Free University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 4.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The reports each of them wrote can be found [http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal strategy was to

# Provide evidence that the Holocaust happened, with a specific focus on the evidence for: the existence and use of gas chambers; and a co-ordinated Nazi plan, directed by Hitler, for the extermination of Jews. The goal was not to prove the holocaust, but to show that any reasonable and fair-minded historian would not doubt it, and that Irving must therefore not be reasonable or fair-minded.
# Document Irving's political views and associations with extremist, [[neo-Nazi]] groups.
# Examine Irving's work to see whether Irving did indeed falsify the historical record, as Lipstadt had claimed he did.

Van Pelt, Browning and Longerich were assigned to the first part. Funke wrote a report for the second and Evans the third.&lt;ref name="Evans2930"&gt;[[#Evans2001|Evans (2001)]], pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyers for Lipstadt ([[Mishcon de Reya]]) and Penguin (Davenport Lyons) worked closely, for the most part agreeing on the way to deal with the claim. One minor setback came when Penguin and their lawyers Davenport Lyons were keen that the information provided by the experts they had instructed be incorporated in an amended defence (which Heather Rogers drafted). Initially Mishcon were unpersuaded but Davenport Lyons were insistent, feeling that the amended document provided a clear statement of the strong evidence against Irving. The decision was eventually left to Richard Rampton and Heather Rogers as they would be presenting the case and both were in favour of amending; Mishcon relented.

The testimony of Van Pelt and Evans proved to be the most substantial. During cross-examination, Irving was unable to undermine either Evans, who had been highly critical of his scholarship or van Pelt, whose report concentrated on the evidence that contradicted the holocaust deniers' arguments about [[Auschwitz Birkenau]]. Evans was assisted by two postgraduates as researchers Thomas Skelton-Robinson and [[Nikolaus Wachsmann|Nik Wachsmann]]; Evans and his students took 18 months to write a 740-page report, finishing it in the summer of 1999.&lt;ref name = lipstadt42 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--this stuff probably belongs in the testimony section: Van Pelt wrote a report attesting to the fact that the death camps were designed, built and used for the purpose of mass killing while Browning testified for the reality of the Holocaust. Longerich wrote about Hitler's anti-semitism and testified about Irving's links to [[neo-Nazi]] groups in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Australia, Germany and Austria.--&gt;

=== Settlement offers ===

A short time later, Irving privately approached Penguin and offered to drop them from his lawsuit if they would pull the book from publication in the UK and destroy all of the remaining copies, publicly disavow all of Lipstadt's conclusions and make a charitable donation of £500 in the name of Irving's daughter (who is disabled). He also suggested to Penguin that they keep any terms confidential because he had no intention of settling with Lipstadt. Bays and Bateman made clear that the publisher rejected his terms.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=103–104}} Three weeks later, Irving officially offered to settle with both parties, the terms being that the book be withdrawn from circulation, both parties apologise and (each) make a £500 donation. Lipstadt instructed her lawyers to reject the offer.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=105}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Irving later claimed without evidence that Penguin wanted to settle the case (not specifying whether this applied to one of his two "offers" or both of them) and were somehow pressured by Dr. Lipstadt not to; DD Guttenplan's book outlined how Penguin dismissed Irving for several reasons, including contempt for him and dismay over the certainty that the publisher would have been called by Lipstadt's lawyers as plaintiff advocates if they had settled the lawsuit.

==== Evans ====

Evans and his two assistants spent more than two years examining Irving's work. This research found that Irving had misrepresented historical evidence to support his prejudices. In his report and testimony, Evans suggested that in his view, Irving had knowingly used forged documents as sources, and that for this reason, Irving could not be regarded as a historian. His conclusions were that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdot.org/evans/#evans_6.html |publisher=Holocaust Denial on Trial |work=Expert Witness Report by Richard J. Evans FBA, Professor of Modern History, University of Cambridge |title=Chapter 6. General Conclusion |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C16768A, Hans Heinrich Lammers.jpg|250px|right|150px|thumb|[[Hans Lammers]], the Chief of the Reich Chancellery. A 1942 memo by him to the Justice Minister saying that Hitler wanted the "Jewish Question put on the backburner" until after the war was one of the chief pieces of evidence for Irving during Lipstadt's libel trial in 2000]]

During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal antagonism between the two men.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=223}} Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=226}} A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory [[Hans Lammers]] to the ''Reich'' Justice Minister [[Franz Schlegelberger]] in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=230-233}} Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by [[Eberhard Jäckel]] in the 1970s;{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=230-232}} Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying "[i]t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?".{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=232-233}} In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret [[euphemism]]s as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about [[Madagascar Plan|Madagascar]], you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=233}}

In 2001, Evans described his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."&lt;ref name="robertfulford.com"&gt;{{cite web

==== Longerich ====

Longerich testified to the meaning of the often euphemistic language used by German officials during the war regarding the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question", and argued that from 1941 onwards, the term "resettlement in the East" was a metaphor for deportation to the death camps.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=236}} During his exchanges with Irving, Longerich insisted quite firmly that the term "resettlement" was only a euphemism for extermination and nothing more, and used the [[Posen speeches|Posen speech]] given by [[Himmler]] in October 1943 as a proof of the genocidal policy of the German state.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=236-238}} Irving by contrast argued for a literal interpretation of the phrase "resettlement in the East".{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=236-238}}

==== Browning ====

During his testimony and a cross-examination by Irving, Browning countered Irving's suggestion that the last chapter of the Holocaust has yet to be written (implying there were grounds for doubting the reality of the Holocaust) by replying: "We are still discovering things about the Roman Empire. There is no last chapter in history."{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=210}}

Browning countered Irving's argument that the lack of a written ''[[Führer]]'' order proves the alleged non-occurrence of the Holocaust by arguing that although no such order was ever written down, Hitler had almost certainly made statements to his leading subordinates indicating his wishes in regards to the Jews of Europe during the war, thus rendering the need for a written order irrelevant.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=211}} Browning testified that several leading experts on Nazi Germany believe that there was no written ''Führer'' order for the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question", but no historian doubts the reality of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=212}} Browning went on to assert that Irving was attempting to falsely equate doubts about the existence of a written ''Führer'' order with doubts about the Holocaust.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=212}} Browning used to support his thesis the example of Hitler's secret speech to his ''[[Gauleiter]]s'' on 12 December 1941, in which Hitler strongly alluded to genocide as the "Final Solution".{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=212-213}}

Browning testified that the [[Madagascar Plan]] of 1940–41 was "fantastic" and "bizarre", but countered Irving's suggestion that this proves the alleged impossibility of the Holocaust by stating: "...I do think they took it seriously. It is fantastic, but of course, Auschwitz is fantastic, too".{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=211-212}} Browning testified that the Madagascar Plan was not "Hitler's pipe dream" as Irving claimed, and that "I would not call it a pipe dream, because I think, if England had surrendered, they would have tried to do it. They would have tried to implement it just as they tried to implement the Lublin reservation plan [Browning was referring to the [[Nisko Plan]] here] and just as they tried and succeeded in implementing the death camp plans."

Browning categorically rejected Irving's claim that there was no reliable statistical information on the size of the pre-war Jewish population in Europe or on the killing processes and argued that the only reason historians debate whether five or six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust is due to a lack of access to archives in the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=213}} Likewise, Browning argued that it is possible to become soaked in human blood after shooting people at close range based on his research for his 1992 book ''Ordinary Men'' and dismissed Irving's argument that accounts of German personnel being soaked in blood were improbable because it is not possible to have a blood splattered uniform after shooting people at close range.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=213-214}}

Browning responded to Irving's claim that because Browning had done work for the [[Yad Vashem]] centre in [[Jerusalem]] that made him an "Israeli agent" and thereby compromised his scholarly abilities by stating: "If that was the case, then since I had been at the [US] Holocaust Museum, I would also have been an agent of the American government, and since I have received scholarships in Germany, I would be an agent of the German government, so I must be a very duplicitous fellow to be able to follow these regimes." Irving seemed anxious for Browning's approval, and Browning later recalled that Irving behaved as if the two of them were on "a joint journey of exploration and discovery."&lt;ref name="robertfulford.com" /&gt;{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=210}}&lt;!-- See Evans, p. 205. This is the language that Irving used to start off his cross-examination --&gt;

==== Van Pelt ====&lt;!-- Would his last name be "Pelt" or "Van Pelt" or "van Pelt"? --&gt;
[[Robert Jan van Pelt]], an architectural historian, was engaged by the defence as an expert witness. He prepared a 700-page report, in which he examined the evidence for the existence of the [[gas chambers]] at Auschwitz. He also defended himself on cross-examination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pelt2002|Pelt (2002)]], page ix&lt;/ref&gt;
Irving floundered against van Pelt's deep knowledge of the mechanics of Auschwitz Birkenau. Rampton and van Pelt had bonded on a trip to Auschwitz with Rogers and Bateman and they had spent hours talking through Irving's claims. Van Pelt took the three lawyers and Deborah Lipstadt around Birkenau showing them how Irving's claims were false and the mistake he had made about the physical layout. 
&lt;!-- This needs to be expanded. Tell the whole story about how Irving attempted to "set a trap" for Pelt on the cross examination --&gt;
He later adapted the report he wrote into book form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pelt2002|Pelt (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Claimant ====
In the trial, Irving [[Litigant in person|represented himself]]. He called the American [[Kevin B. MacDonald]], an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologist]], to testify on his behalf. Irving made much of the statement by the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]], who Irving went to pains to point out was both a Marxist and a man who would have been considered Jewish in Nazi racial theory, in his 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', that most of the people who died at Auschwitz were the victims of disease rather than murder.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=167}} In response, Peter Longerich argued that Mayer did not deny the Holocaust in his book, and that he was simply wrong about more Jews dying of "natural" as opposed to "unnatural" causes of death at Auschwitz.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=167-168}}

Irving also subpoenaed the diplomatic historian Donald Cameron Watt and the military historian [[John Keegan]] to testify in his case against Lipstadt; both men had refused an earlier offer to testify for Irving on their own and appeared to be very reluctant on the stand. Rather than focus on the defence's evidence against him, or on whether or not Lipstadt had defamed him, Irving seemed to focus mainly on his "right to [[free speech]]". In his closing statement, Irving claimed to have been a victim of an international, mostly Jewish, conspiracy for more than three decades.{{fact?|date=June 2017}}

== Ruling ==
{{wikisource|David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt}}
The judgment was presented on 11 April 2000, although the lawyers had received the decision 24 hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lipstadt2005|Lipstadt (2005)]], page 267&lt;/ref&gt; To the large crowd assembled, the judge read portions of his written judgment.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=274}}

The written judgment came out to 349 pages.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=274}} Following an introduction&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Section 1&lt;/ref&gt; and a discussion of the complaint,&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Section 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; more than three-quarters of the written judgment&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Section 4-12&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to an analysis of all the evidence that was presented.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|pp=275-277}} Only then does the judge get to his findings on the evidence.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=277}}
The judge deems that "in the course of his prolonged cross-examination, Evans justified each and every one of the criticisms on which the Defendants have chosen to rely."&lt;ref name=13.10&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.10&lt;/ref&gt; On the issue of Auschwitz, the judge states "My conclusion is that the various categories of evidence do 'converge' in the manner suggested by the Defendants... Having considered the various arguments advanced by Irving to assail the effect of the convergent evidence relied upon by the Defendants, it is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews,"&lt;ref name=13.91&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.91&lt;/ref&gt; and "it follows that it is my conclusion that Irving's denials of these propositions were contrary to the evidence."&lt;ref name=13.98&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.98&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "the allegation that Irving is a racist is also established."&lt;ref name=13.106&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the judge ruled that the defence succeeded in proving everything they claimed in trial but for two assertions: that Irving had broken an agreement with the Moscow archives and mishandled the glass plates containing Goebbels' diaries, and that he hung a portrait of Hitler above his desk.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=283}} However, the judge pointed out that "the charges against Irving that have been proved to be true are of sufficient gravity" that those two claims mentioned above would "not have any material effect on Irving's reputation."{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=283}} The judge decided this in accordance with section 5 of the [[Defamation Act 1952]], which states that a justification defence can succeed despite the failure to prove minor assertions.{{sfn|Guttenplan|2001|p=283}}

The judge summarised his findings as follows: &lt;!-- the judge concludes that he found the following claims against Irving to be '[[substantial truth|substantially true]]': --&gt;

{{quote|Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence; that for the same reasons he has portrayed Hitler in an unwarrantedly favourable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews; that he is an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-Semitic and racist, and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism...&lt;ref name=13.167&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/juliankossoff/100055322/jews-have-a-bigger-worry-than-the-vile-nutter-david-irving-ahmadinejads-iran/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Jews have a bigger worry than the vile nutter David Irving: Ahmadinejad's Iran | date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore the defence of justification succeeds...&lt;ref name=13.168&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 13.168&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that there must be judgment for the Defendants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#judgment|''Irving v Lipstadt'' (2000)]], Paragraph 14.1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Further events==

===Appeal===
Irving subsequently appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. On 20 July 2001, his application for appeal was denied by Lords Justices [[Malcolm Pill|Pill]], Mantell, and [[Sir Richard Buxton|Buxton]].&lt;ref name=appealjudgment&gt;''Irving v Penguin Books Ltd &amp; Anor'' (2001) [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2001/1197.html EWCA Civ 1197]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Holocaust denier' loses appeal bid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1448417.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 January 2001 |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
In light of the evidence presented at the trial, a number of Irving's works that had previously escaped serious scrutiny were brought to public attention. He was also liable to pay all of the substantial costs of the trial (between one and two million [[Pound sterling|pounds]]), which ruined him financially and forced him into [[bankruptcy]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Lakisher|title=The David Irving Trial in Israel|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/3141|accessdate=19 February 2018|agency=INS|date=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 arrest===
In 2006, Irving pleaded [[guilt (law)|guilty]] to the charge of denying the Holocaust in Austria, where Holocaust denial is a crime and where an arrest warrant was issued based on speeches he made in 1989. Irving knew that the warrant had been issued and that he was banned from Austria, but chose to go to Austria anyway. After he was arrested, Irving claimed in his plea that he changed his opinions on the Holocaust, "I said that then based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews."&lt;ref name='BBC 2006-02-20'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Holocaust denier Irving is jailed | date=20 February 2006 | publisher=[[BBC]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/europe/4733820.stm | work =[[BBC News]] | pages = | accessdate = 16 June 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing of Irving's sentence, Lipstadt said, "I am not happy when censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via censorship… The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth."&lt;ref name='BBC 2006-02-20'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NPR 2006-02-21'&gt;{{cite news | first=Neal | last=Conan |authorlink= | title=Austrian Court Jails Historian Who Denied Holocaust | date=21 February 2006 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=5226811 | work =Talk of the Nation | pages = | accessdate = 16 June 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some saw the case as a vindication of the UK's strict libel laws.&lt;ref name="Independent 2000-04-18" /&gt; Others noted that Justice Gray "indicated that he did not 'regard it as being a part' of his function 'as the trial judge to make findings of fact as to what did and what did not occur during the Nazi regime in Germany', but he then spent hundreds of pages arguing about his position on such issues," claiming that it was the overly-strict libel laws that forced a judge to determine historical fact.&lt;ref name=Hasian2002&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Holocaust denial debates: The symbolic significance of Irving v.

Evans noted that some articles assumed that Lipstadt was suing Irving even though the plaintiff's name appears first in the court filing and they could have figured this out, and also that Lipstadt was accused of "trying to silence" Irving by launching a defence against Irving's own lawsuit (a lawsuit that would have ended in Lipstadt being silenced in the UK by having her book removed from circulation if Irving had won the case).

In 2005, [[C-Span|C-SPAN]] planned to cover Dr. Lipstadt's book on the trial, ''History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving'' via its Book TV programme, but the cable network was heavily criticized when it was revealed that they had planned to put together a de facto debate between Dr. Lipstadt and Irving, by airing a new speech by Irving that they'd arranged with him to videotape, after an older one by Lipstadt (the network claimed this was going to be done for "balance"); when Lipstadt told C-SPAN she would not appear on the show under those circumstances, C-SPAN originally told her they would air Irving's speech by itself, but C-SPAN ended up cancelling this planned programme and instead aired a special that focused on how the trial was viewed by ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter [[T. R. Reid]] and included clips of both Lipstadt and Irving.

=== Portrayal ===

In December 2000, an episode of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'', entitled "Holocaust on Trial", focused on the case.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/27.html#2711|title=Past Television Programs – Season 27: January – December 2000|work=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The complete transcript of the episode is available free [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2711holocaust.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Produced concurrently with the actual trial, the programme's production staff frequently visited the courtroom. As video cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, the events in the trial were re-enacted for television. Irving was played by British actor [[John Castle]]. A team of historians were employed to gather the material necessary for the episode. The programme was almost completed when the verdict for the real trial was handed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/holocaust/making.html|title=Holocaust on Trial – The Director's Story|work=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=26 June 2009|last=Woodhead|first=Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured interviews with [[David Cesarani]], [[Raul Hilberg]], [[Richard Breitman]], [[Richard Overy]] and [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].

The rights to adapt the story of the trial into a film were optioned by [[Participant Media]]. A script was written by David Hare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |authorlink= |title= 'Soloist' team will put history on 'Trial' |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002779.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|RBI]] |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, it was reported that [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Tom Wilkinson]] had signed on to portray Dr. Lipstadt and David Irving in a feature film about the 2000 trial. In November 2015, [[Rachel Weisz]] joined the cast of the film (replacing Swank) along with [[Timothy Spall]], who would play Irving while Wilkinson would play [[Richard Rampton]]. [[Bleecker Street (company)|Bleecker Street]] released the film, titled [[Denial (2016 film)|''Denial'']], in the United States in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/denial-holocaust-denier-movie-rachel-weisz-bleecker-street-1201609227/|title='Denial' Holocaust-Denier Drama Now Starring Rachel Weisz Acquired By Bleecker Street|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=November 5, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M. Tung| title = Preserving the world's great cities:The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis|edition= 2001| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn= 0-517-70148-0|url=http://www.anthonymtung.com/excerpts.htm#Chap4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While extensively damaged by the failed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]], the city later underwent a [[Destruction of Warsaw|planned demolition]] by German forces under order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and high officials within the Nazi government. On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

This is a '''list of modern conflicts in the Middle East''' ensuing in the geographic and political region known as the [[Middle East]]. The "Middle East" is traditionally defined as the [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]]), [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]] and neighboring areas of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]]. It currently encompasses the area from Egypt, [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]] in the west to Iran and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Hourani et al., ''The Modern Middle East: A Reader.'' 1993: p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and from Turkey and Iran in the north, to [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] in the south.
* Conflicts are separate incidents with at least 100 casualties, and are listed by total deaths, including sub-conflicts.&lt;ref name="warlist"/&gt;
* The term "modern" refers to the post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,  in other words, since 1918.

With farmland, crops, livestock, and infrastructure destroyed, as many as 2 million Iranians died of famine at the war’s end. Although the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the recall of Russian troops, and thus gave hope to Iranians that the foreign yoke might be relenting, the British quickly moved to fill the vacuum in the north, and by 1918, had turned the country into an unofficial protectorate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2014|p=123}}: "As the Great War came to its close in the fall of 1918, Iran’s plight was woeful. The war had created an economic catastrophe, invading armies had ruined farmland and irrigation works, crops and livestock were stolen or destroyed, and peasants had been taken from their fields and forced to serve as laborers in the variousarmies. Famine killed as many as two million Iranians out of a population of little more than ten million.”&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37223">This '''list of preserved historic blast furnaces''' contains decommissioned [[blast furnace]]s, of which substantial remains survive. The furnaces are preserved in a [[park]] or museum, or as a site otherwise open to visitors, or intended to become such.

While pre-20th-century blast furnaces already have a long history of monument preservation, the perception of 20th century mass production blast furnace installations as [[industrial heritage]] is a comparably new trend. For a long time, it has been normal procedure for such a blast furnace to be demolished after being decommissioned and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. It has only been in recent years{{When|date=January 2011}} that numerous countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their [[industrial history]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, the first such blast furnace not to be demolished stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]] (decommissioned in 1968), followed by the last blast furnace of Yahata Steel Works in [[Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]] (decommissioned in 1972) and the "Carrie Furnaces" in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] (decommissioned in 1978). One of the two blast furnaces in [[Neunkirchen, Saarland|Neunkirchen]] in [[Germany]] (decommissioned in 1982) was the first blast furnace worldwide to be not just preserved, but actively refurbished for the purpose of preservation.

For 20th-century mass production blast furnaces, the degree of accurate preservation versus integration into new structures, or even re-purposing, differs between the various sites. Colorful illumination installations at night are common.

==List of preserved industrial mass production blast furnaces around the world==
These installations all date from the 20th century. They are supported by outer frames made of metal, were supplied with pre-heated blast air from external Cowper stoves, were typically part of large industrial compounds where, at one point, multiple blast furnaces were typically standing and operating side by side for efficiency reasons, raw materials were delivered by external elevating mechanisms, and the entire site was accessible by [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] which delivered the raw materials and carried off the freshly smelted [[pig iron]] in [[Ladle (metallurgy)|ladles]].

In many cases, the preserved sites have been deliberately stripped down to minimize maintenance costs; namely, some blast furnaces and related installations have been demolished. The goal was to only retain one or two blast furnaces including the relevant related installations (such as Cowper stoves, cast house, winch house etc.), which are considered sufficient to explain the blast furnace process and all related functions to visitors.

The first such decommissioned blast furnace that wasn't demolished and has been preserved to this very day stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]], and has ceased operation as early as 1968.

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right| The [[storming of the Bastille]], 14 July 1789, during the [[French Revolution]].]] 

This is a '''list of [[revolutions]] and [[rebellion]]s'''.
&lt;!-- It is not meant to include every instance of violent conflict. Do not add battles and wars which are unconnected to a revolution or rebellion. Do not add "revolutions" mandated from above. Do not add every riot and violent demonstration in the history of mankind, and do not accord recent events undue weight. Note: there is a section at the end, "Cultural, intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions", which does list some significant events, phenomenae or trends which are not violent rebellions or revolutions.  That may be split off later.--&gt;

The '''long 18th century''' is a phrase used by many British historians to cover a more ''natural'' historical period than the simple use of the standard calendar definition. They expand the century to include larger British historical movements, with their subsequent "long" 18th century typically running from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 to the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Olsen |first1=John Andreas |first2=Colin S. |last2=Gray | title=The Practice of Strategy: From Alexander the Great to the Present |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2011 | isbn=9780199608638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baines&gt;{{cite book | last = Baines | first = Paul | title = The Long 18th century | publisher=Arnold | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-340-81372-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions, perhaps those with a more social or global interest, extend the period further to, for example, 1660–1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=O'Gorman, Frank | title=The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688–1832 (The Arnold History of Britain Series) |publisher=Hodder Arnold| year=1997 | isbn=978-0-340-56751-7 | oclc=243883533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baines&gt;{{cite book | last = Baines | first = Paul | title = The Long 18th century | publisher=Arnold | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-340-81372-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Marshall |first=P.

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

''World Futures'' 70/2 (2014): 120–39].&lt;/ref&gt; Others further argue that due to lack of food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/197551/2/WP59.pdf|title=The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|last=Tisdell|first=Clem|date=1 January 2015|website=University of Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory. His essay, [[Tragedy of the commons|"The Tragedy of the Commons,"]] argued that "a finite world can support only a finite population" and that "freedom to breed will bring ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|year=1968|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Club of Rome]] published a famous book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOcUZ9uquhEC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking Nature Into Account: A Report to the Club of Rome |editor=Wouter van Dieren |year=1995 |publisher=Springer Books |isbn=978-0-387-94533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] is a prominent neo-Malthusian who first raised concerns in 1968 with the publication of ''[[The Population Bomb]]''.

On the other hand, in 2011 [[Andrey Korotayev]] and his colleagues suggested that the emergence of major sociopolitical upheavals at the escape from the Malthusian trap is not an abnormal, but a regular phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Korotayev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79t737gt |title=A Trap At The Escape From The Trap?

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==

The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

'''Mu''' is the name of a suggested [[lost continent]] whose concept and name were proposed by 19th-century traveler and writer [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], who claimed that several ancient civilizations, such as those of [[Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], were created by refugees from Mu — which he stated was located in the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="qmoo"&gt;{{cite book| title = Queen Móo &amp; The Egyptian Sphinx|first= Augustus|last=Le Plongeon| year = 1896| pages = 277 pages| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x74RAAAAYAAJ| publisher = The Author}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was popularized and expanded by [[James Churchward]], who asserted that Mu was once located in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].&lt;ref name="chlost26"/&gt;

The existence of Mu was already being disputed in Le Plongeon's time. Currently scientists dismiss the concept of Mu (and other alleged lost continents such as [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]) as physically impossible, arguing that a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed in the short period of time required by this premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haugton|first=Brian | title = Hidden History| publisher = New Page Books| year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-56414-897-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fSbRZunGbF4C&amp;pg=PA59}} Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="camp"&gt;{{cite book| author = De Camp, Lyon Sprague | title = Lost Continents: Atlantis Theme in History, Science and Literature| publisher = Dover Publications| origyear = 1954| year = 1971| isbn = 978-0-486-22668-2| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3YHwFivT-ykC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mu's existence is considered to have no factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Brennan|first=Louis A.| title=No Stone Unturned: An Almanac of North American Pre-history| publisher = Random House| year = 1959}} Page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Witzel|first= Michael | title = Archaeological Fantasies| editor = Garrett G.

==History of the concept==

===Augustus Le Plongeon===
The mythical idea of Mu first appeared in the works of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), after his investigations of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]].&lt;ref name="qmoo"/&gt; He claimed that he had translated ancient Mayan writings which supposedly showed that the Maya civilization of the Yucatán was older than those of [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]], and told the story of an even older continent.

Le Plongeon actually got the name "Mu" from [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], who in 1864 mistranslated what was then called the [[Troano Codex]] using the [[de Landa alphabet]].  Brasseur believed that a word which he read as ''Mu'' referred to a land which had been submerged by a catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;John Sladek, ''The New Apocrypha'' (New York: Stein and day, 1974) 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Le Plongeon then identified this lost land with [[Atlantis]], and turned it into a continent which had supposedly sunk into the Atlantic Ocean:

{{quote|In our journey westward across the Atlantic we shall pass in sight of that spot where once existed the pride and life of the ocean, the Land of Mu, which, at the epoch that we have been considering, had not yet been visited by the wrath of Human, that lord of volcanic fires to whose fury it afterward fell a victim. The description of that land given to [[Solon]] by [[Sonchis of Sais|Sonchis]], priest at [[Sais]]; its destruction by [[earthquake]]s, and submergence, recorded by [[Plato]] in his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', have been told and retold so many times that it is useless to encumber these pages with a repetition of it.&lt;ref name="qmoo"/&gt;{{rp|ch. VI, p. 66}}}}

Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land's demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to [[Central America]] and became the Maya.&lt;ref name="camp"/&gt;

===James Churchward===
[[File:Lemuria mumap2.jpg|thumb|Churchward's map showing how he thought Mu refugees spread out after the cataclysm through South America, along the shores of Atlantis, and into Africa]]
Mu, as a lost Pacific Ocean continent, was later popularised by [[James Churchward]] (1851–1936) in a series of books, beginning with ''Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man'' (1926),&lt;ref name="chlost26"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man |first= James|last=Churchward | year = 1926 | isbn = 0-7661-4680-4 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; re-edited later as ''The Lost Continent Mu'' (1931).&lt;ref name="chlost31"&gt;{{cite book |first= James|last=Churchward | title = The Lost Continent of Mu | publisher = Ives Washburn | location = New York | year = 1931}} Re-published by Adventures Unlimited Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular books in the series are ''The Children of Mu'' (1931), and ''The Sacred Symbols of Mu'' (1933).

Churchward claimed that "more than fifty years ago", while he was a soldier in [[India]], he befriended a high-ranking temple priest who showed him a set of ancient "sunburnt" clay tablets, supposedly in a long lost "Naga-Maya language" which only two other people in India could read. Having mastered the language himself, Churchward found out that they originated from "the place where [man] first appeared—Mu". The 1931 edition states that "all matter of science in this work are based on translations of two sets of ancient tablets": the clay tablets he read in India, and a collection of 2,500 stone tablets that had been uncovered by [[William Niven]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Churchward gave a vivid description of Mu as the home of an advanced civilization, the [[Naacal]], which flourished between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago, was dominated by a “white race",&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|48}} and was "superior in many respects to our own".&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|17}} At the time of its demise, about 12,000 years ago, Mu had 64,000,000 inhabitants and many large cities, and colonies on the other continents.

Churchward claimed that the landmass of Mu was located in the Pacific Ocean, and stretched east–west from the [[Marianas Islands|Marianas]] to [[Easter Island]], and north–south from [[Hawaii]] to [[Mangaia]]. He claimed that according to the [[creation myth]] he read in the Indian tablets, Mu had been lifted above sea level by the expansion of underground volcanic gases. Eventually Mu "was completely obliterated in almost a single night":&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|44}} after a series of earthquakes and [[volcanic eruption]]s, "the broken land fell into that great abyss of fire" and was covered by "fifty millions of square miles of water."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient [[megalithic]] architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the [[Sun]]. Churchward claims that the king of Mu was named Ra and he relates this to the Egyptian god of the sun, [[Ra]], and the [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] word for Sun, ''ra’a'', which he incorrectly spells "''raa''."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|48}} He claimed to have found symbols of the Sun in "Egypt, [[Babylonia]], [[Peru]] and all ancient lands and countries – it was a universal symbol."&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Churchward attributed all megalithic art in [[Polynesia]] to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found "depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins", such as the stone hats (''[[pukao]]'') on top of the giant ''[[moai]]'' statues of Easter Island.  Citing [[W.J. Johnson]], Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as "spheres" that "seem to show red in the distance", and asserts that they “represent the Sun as Ra.”&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|138}} He also incorrectly claimed that some of them are made of "red sandstone",&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|89}} which does not exist on the island. The platforms on which the statues rest (''ahu'') are described by Churchward as being "platform-like accumulations of cut and dressed stone", which were supposedly left in their current positions "awaiting shipment to some other part of the continent for the building of temples and palaces".&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|89}} He also cites the pillars "erected by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]]" as an example of this lost civilization's handiwork.&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|158}} In Churchward's view, the present-day Polynesians are not descendants of the dominant members of the lost civilization of Mu, responsible for these great works, but are instead descendants of survivors of the cataclysm that adopted "the first [[cannibalism]] and savagery" in the world.&lt;ref name="chlost31"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

[[Image:Yonaguni Ruins Scuba.jpg|thumb|Underwater structures claimed to be remnants of Mu, near [[Yonaguni]], [[Japan]]]]

===Modern claims===
James Bramwell and [[William Scott-Elliott]] claimed that the cataclysmic events on Mu began 800,000 years ago&lt;ref name="bram39"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Atlantis |first= James |last=Bramwell | year = 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} and went on until the last catastrophe, which occurred in precisely 9564 BC.&lt;ref name="bram39"/&gt;{{rp|195}}

In the 1930s, [[Atatürk]], founder of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], was interested in Churchward's work and considered Mu as a possible location of the [[Urheimat|original homeland]] of the [[Turkish people|Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kayıp Kıta Mu'', presentation, Ege-Meta Yayınları, İzmir, 2000, {{ISBN|975-7089-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Masaaki Kimura]] has suggested that certain underwater features located off the coast of [[Yonaguni|Yonaguni Island]], [[Japan]] (popularly known as the  [[Yonaguni Monument]]) are ruins of Mu&lt;ref name="mukimura"&gt;{{cite book | title = Mu tairiku wa Ryukyu ni atta (The Continent of Mu was in Ryukyu) |first= Masaaki|last=Kimura| publisher = Tokuma Shoten| location = Tokyo | year = 1991 | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Robert M. |last=Schoch | title = Ancient underwater pyramid structure off the coast of Yonaguni-jima| url = http://www.morien-institute.org/yonaguni_schoch1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or "ruins of the lost world of Muin" according to [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Japan's Underwater Ruins (video) | url = http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2007/08/24/vo.japan.underwater.ruins.reut | publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Criticisms==

===Geological arguments===
Modern [[geology|geological]] knowledge rules out "lost continents" of any significant size.  According to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which has been extensively confirmed since the 1970s, the [[Earth's crust]] consists of lighter "[[sial]]" rocks ([[continental crust]] rich in [[aluminium]] [[silicates]]) that float on heavier "[[sima (geology)|sima]]" rocks ([[oceanic crust]] richer in [[magnesium]] silicates). The sial is generally absent in the ocean floor where the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] is a few kilometers thick, while the continents are huge solid blocks tens of kilometers thick.  Since continents float on the sima much like [[iceberg]]s float on water, a continent cannot simply "sink" under the ocean.&lt;!--See talk page--&gt;

It is true that [[continental drift]] and [[seafloor spreading]] can change the shape and position of continents and occasionally break a continent into two or more pieces (as happened to [[Pangaea]]). However, these are very slow processes that occur in [[geological time scale]]s (hundreds of millions of years). Over the scale of history (tens of thousands of years), the sima under the continental crust can be considered solid, and the continents are basically anchored on it. It is almost certain that the continents and ocean floors have retained their present position and shape for the whole span of human existence.

There is also no conceivable event that could have "destroyed" a continent, since its huge mass of sial rocks would have to end up somewhere—and there is no trace of it at the bottom of the oceans. The [[Oceania|Pacific Ocean islands]] are not part of a submerged landmass but rather the tips of isolated [[volcano]]es.

[[Image:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|right|Map of Easter Island showing locations of the ''ahu'' and ''moai'']]

This is the case, in particular, of [[Easter Island]], which is a recent volcanic peak surrounded by deep ocean (3,000 m deep at 30&amp;nbsp;km off the island). After visiting the island in the 1930s, [[Alfred Metraux]] observed that the ''moai'' platforms are concentrated along the current coast of the island, which implies that the island's shape has changed little since they were built. Moreover, the "Triumphal Road" that [[Pierre Loti]] had reported ran from the island to the submerged lands below, is actually a natural lava flow.&lt;ref name="metr"&gt;{{cite book | title = Mysteries of Easter Island | first = Alfred | last = Metraux | url = http://www.davidmetraux.com/daniel/docs/alfred/alfred_metraux_mysteries_of_easter_island.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124306/http://www.davidmetraux.com/daniel/docs/alfred/alfred_metraux_mysteries_of_easter_island.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while Churchward was correct in his claim that the island has no sandstone or sedimentary rocks, the point is moot because the ''[[pukao]]'' are all made of native volcanic [[scoria]].

===Archaeological and genetic evidence===

There is evidence that the civilizations of the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] developed independently of each other&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abramyan|first=Evgeny|title=Civilization in the 21st Century|year=2009|publisher=How to Save the Future?|location=Russia|url=http://www.savefuture.net/files/2009edition-en.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118105055/http://www.savefuture.net/files/2009edition-en.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}} and, in fact, [[agriculture]] and urban societies probably first developed after the end of the [[Ice Age]], somewhere in the [[Levant]] some 10,000 years ago and gradually spread outwards from there to the rest of the Old World. The development of the oldest known cities, such as [[Çatalhöyük]], can more easily be attributed to local and gradual evolution than to the coming of refugees from a "superior civilization".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Troano Codex===
Other researchers who have tried to use the [[de Landa alphabet]] have reported that it produces only gibberish. Recent research into the [[Maya script|Mayan "alphabet"]] has shown it to not consist of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] but [[logogram]]s. Recent translations of the [[Troano Codex]] have shown it to be a treatise on astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Citadels of Mystery, L Sprague deCamp and C decamp, Fontana Books 1969, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''new history''' from the French term ''nouvelle histoire'', was coined by [[Jacques Le Goff]]&lt;ref&gt;Miri Rubin, ''The work of Jacques Le Goff and the challenges of medieval history'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Nora]], leaders of the third generation of the [[Annales School]], in the 1970s. The movement can be associated with [[cultural history]], history of representations and ''[[histoire des mentalités]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mucchielli, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new history movement's inclusive definition of the proper matter of historical study has also given it the label ''total history''. The movement was contrasted with the traditional ways of writing history which focused on [[Political history|politics]] and '[[theory of great men|great men]]'. The new history rejected any insistence on composing [[historical narrative]]; an over-emphasis on [[administrative documents]] as basic source materials; concern with individuals' motivations and intentions as explanatory factors for historical events; and the old belief in [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].

The approach was rejected by [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] because it downplayed what Marxists believed was the central role of class in shaping history.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bois, "Marxisme et histoire nouvelle", in Le Goff, ed. ''Nouvelle Histoire'', 375–93. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History in schools==
The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle Histoire, as disseminated in the 1960s and 1970s by ''[[:fr:Cahiers pédagogiques|Cahiers pédagogiques]] and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, dean of the history/geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education, advised teachers to provide historic documents and promote "active methods", which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery".

Proponents said it was a reaction against the [[Rrote learning|memorization of names and dates]] that characterised traditional teaching and left bored students. Traditionalists protested loudly that it was a [[postmodern]] innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and [[culture of France|national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, "The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s", ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199–221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The "Nouvelle histoire" became controversial after 1945 in [[German historiography]], where it especially influenced [[medieval studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lutz Raphael]], ''Die Erben von Bloch und Febvre: Annales-Geschichtsschreibung und nouvelle histoire in Frankreich 1945–1980'' (Stuttgart, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  However most German historians considered the approach too [[Positivism|positivistic]] for their taste, and not [[Philosophy of history|philosophical]] enough.&lt;ref&gt;Miri Rubin, ''The Work of Jacques Le Goff and the Challenges of Medieval History'' (1997) p 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.'' [http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

===Sections===

The Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.

* Letters
* The Book of Adela's Followers 
* The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia 
* The Writings of Frêthorik and Wiljow

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

'''Path dependence''' explains how the set of decisions one faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions one has made in the past or by the events that one has experienced, even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Definition from [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/06/15/346883/-Our-Love-Of-Sewers-A-Lesson-in-Path-Dependence "Our Love Of Sewers: A Lesson in Path Dependence"], Dave Praeger, 15 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]] and the [[social science]]s, path dependence can refer either to outcomes at a single moment in time, or to long-run equilibria of a process. In common usage, the phrase implies either:
{{ordered list |type=upper-alpha
 |that "history matters" — a broad concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liebowitz |first1= S. |last2=Margolis |first2= Stephen |title= Encyclopedia of Law and Economics |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-1-85898-984-6 |page= 981 |quote= Most generally, path dependence means that where we go next depends not only on where we are now, but also upon where we have been.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
 |that predictable [[Amplifier|amplifications]] of small differences are a disproportionate [[ultimate cause|cause]] of later circumstances, and, in the "strong" form, that this historical hang-over is [[inefficient]].&lt;ref name="LMTypes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liebowitz |first1= S. |last2=Margolis |first2= S. |editor1-first= Boudewijn |editor1-last= Bouckaert |editor2-first= Gerrit |editor2-last= De Geest |title= Encyclopedia of Law and Economics, Volume I. The History and Methodology of Law and Economics |url= http://encyclo.findlaw.com/0770book.pdf |accessdate= 2010-05-20 |date=September 2000 |publisher= Edward Elgar |location= Cheltenham |isbn= 978-1-85898-984-6 |page= 985 |quote= path dependence can be weak (the efficiency of the chosen path is tied with some alternatives), semi-strong, (the chosen path is not the best but not worth fixing, or strong (the chosen path is highly inefficient, but we are unable to correct it). }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the first usage, (A), "history matters" is trivially true in many contexts; everything has causes, and sometimes different causes lead to different outcomes. In these contexts, the direct influence of earlier states may not be notable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellaïche |first=Joël |year=2009 |title=On the path-dependence of economic growth |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Economics]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |page=178 |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~jbellaic/growth.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2009.11.002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624073123/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~jbellaic/growth.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-24 |df= }} The standard [[economic growth]] rate measurements are path-dependent, and "the phenomenon of dependence of history might be ignored for short period of time (10 years, 20 years), but is not negligible for [[wiktionary:secular|secular]] comparisons."&lt;/ref&gt; unlike [[Option style#Non-vanilla path-dependent .22exotic.22 options|"path-dependent" options]] in [[finance]], where the influence of history can be [[exotic option|non-standard]].

It is the narrow concept (B), that has the most explanatory force, and which is covered in this article.

==Illustration==
The [[videotape format war]] is an example. Three mechanisms ''independent of product quality'' could explain how [[VHS]] [[format war#1970s|achieved dominance]] over [[Betamax]] from a negligible [[early adoption]] lead:
# A [[network effect]]: [[videocassette]] [[video rental shop|rental stores]] observed more VHS rentals and stocked up on VHS tapes, leading [[Renting#Rental agreements|renters]] to buy VHS players and rent more VHS tapes, until there was complete [[vendor lock-in]].
# A VCR manufacturer [[bandwagon effect]] of switching to VHS-production because they expected it to win the ''standards battle''.
# Sony, the original developer of Betamax, was not very interested in supporting the pornographic video industry, which made nearly all pornographic motion pictures released on video to use VHS format.

An alternative analysis is that VHS was [[Videotape format war#Market share|better-adapted to market demands]] (e.g. having a longer recording time). In this interpretation, path dependence had little to do with VHS's success, which would have occurred even if Betamax had established an early lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liebowitz |first=Stan |title=Re-thinking the Network Economy |year=2002 |page=41 |url= http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/book/chapter1.html#_Toc536617 |isbn=978-0-8144-0649-6 |quote=It was the inferior playing time that led to the demise of the Betamax, not the fact that it was first or second or third.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive feedback]] mechanisms, like bandwagon and network effects, are at the origin of path dependence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} They lead to a reinforcing pattern, in which industries 'tip' towards one or another product design. Uncoordinated [[standardisation]] can be observed in many other situations.

==Economics==
Path dependence theory was originally developed by economists to explain technology adoption processes and industry evolution. The theoretical ideas have had a strong influence on [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An evolutionary theory of economic change|last1=Nelson|first1=R|last2=Winter|first2=S|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many models and empirical cases where economic processes do not progress steadily toward some pre-determined and unique [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], but rather the nature of any equilibrium achieved depends partly on the process of getting there. Therefore, the outcome of a path-dependent process will often not converge towards a unique equilibrium, but will instead reach one of several equilibria (sometimes known as [[Attractor|absorbing states]]).

This dynamic vision of economic evolution is very different from the tradition of [[neo-classical economics]], which in its simplest form assumed that only a single outcome could possibly be reached, regardless of initial conditions or transitory events. With path dependence, both the starting point and 'accidental' events ([[noise (economic)|noise]]) can have significant effects on the ultimate outcome. In each of the following examples it is possible to identify some [[random]] events that disrupted the ongoing course, with irreversible consequences:

* In economic development, it is said (initially by [[Paul A. David|Paul David]] in 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martin |last1=Stack |first2=Myles |last2=Gartland |year=2003 |title=Path Creation, Path Dependency, and Alternative Theories of the Firm |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=487 |quote=Paul David and Brian Arthur published several papers that are now regarded as the foundation of path dependency (David 1985; Arthur 1989, 1990).}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a ''standard'' that is first-to-market can become entrenched (like the [[QWERTY]] layout in typewriters still used in computer keyboards). He called this "path dependence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul David |date=May 1985 |title=Clio and the Economics of QWERTY |journal=American Economic Review |pages=332–337 |volume=75 |number=2 |quote=In such circumstances "historical accidents" can neither be ignored, nor neatly quarantined for the purpose of economic analysis |jstor=1805621}}&amp;nbsp;[https://econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/Ec100C/DavidQwerty.pdf Direct PDF link]&lt;/ref&gt; and said that inferior standards can persist simply because of the [[Legacy system|legacy]] they have built up.

* Economists from [[Adam Smith]] to [[Regional science#New economic geography|Paul Krugman]] have noted that similar businesses tend to congregate geographically ([[Economies of agglomeration|"agglomerate"]]); opening near-similar companies [[labor mobility|attracts workers]] with skills in that business, which draws in more businesses seeking experienced employees. There may have been no reason to prefer one place to another before the industry developed, but as it concentrates geographically, participants elsewhere are at a disadvantage, and will tend to move into the hub, further [[Knowledge spillover|increasing its relative efficiency]]. This [[network effect]] follows a statistical [[power law]] in the idealized case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Souza |first=Raissa M. |year=2007 |title=Emergence of Tempered Preferential Attachment from Optimization |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

* Buyers often [[cluster effect|cluster]] around sellers, and related businesses frequently form [[business cluster]]s, so a concentration of producers (initially formed by accident and agglomeration) can trigger the emergence of many dependent businesses in the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Networks and Local Linkages: The Paradox of Cluster Development in an Open Economy |author=Jen Nelles, Allison Bramwell and David Wolfe |year= 2005 |publisher= Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queens University Press for Queen's School of Policy Studies |isbn= 978-1-55339-047-3 |page= 230 |url= http://www.druid.dk/uploads/tx_picturedb/dw2005-1650.pdf |accessdate= 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s, the US dollar [[exchange rate]] appreciated, lowering the world price of [[tradable goods]] below the cost of production in many (previously successful) [[United States|U.S.]] manufacturers. Some of the factories that closed as a result, could later have been operated at a (cash-flow) profit after dollar depreciation, but reopening would have been too expensive. This is an example of [[hysteresis]], [[switching barriers]], and irreversibility.
* If the economy follows [[adaptive expectations]], future [[inflation]] is partly determined by past experience with inflation, since experience determines expected inflation and this is a major determinant of realized inflation.
* A transitory high rate of [[unemployment]] during a [[recession]] can lead to a permanently higher unemployment rate because of the skills loss (or skill obsolescence) by the unemployed, along with a deterioration of work attitudes. In other words, cyclical unemployment may generate [[structural unemployment]]. This [[structural hysteresis]] model of the [[labour market]] differs from the prediction of a "natural" unemployment rate or [[NAIRU]], around which 'cyclical' unemployment is said to move without influencing the "natural" rate itself.

Liebowitz and Margolis distinguish ''types'' of path dependence;&lt;ref name="LMTypes"/&gt; some do not imply inefficiencies and do not challenge the [[Normative economics|policy implications]] of neoclassical economics. Only "third-degree" path dependence — where switching gains are high, but transition is impractical — involves such a challenge. They argue that such situations should be rare for theoretical reasons, and that no real-world cases of [[Free market|private]] locked-in inefficiencies exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/palgrave/palpd.html |title=Path Dependence '''4. Evidence for Third-Degree Path Dependence''' |author=Stephen E. Margolis |author2=S. J. Liebowitz |accessdate=20 May 2010 |quote=Our reading of the evidence is that there are as yet no proven examples of third degree path dependence in markets.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vergne and Durand qualify this critique by specifying the conditions under which path dependence theory can be tested empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vergne | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Durand | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00913.x | title = The Missing Link Between the Theory and Empirics of Path Dependence: Conceptual Clarification, Testability Issue, and Methodological Implications | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 736 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |quote=In particular, we suggest moving away from historical case studies of supposedly path-dependent processes to focus on more controlled research designs&amp;#x5b;,&amp;#x5d; such as simulations, experiments, and counterfactual investigation."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, a path-dependent stochastic process has an [[asymptotic distribution]] that "evolves as a consequence (function of) the process's own history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution and path dependence in economic ideas: past and present |first=Paul |last=David |year=2005 |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=978-1-84064-081-6 |page=19 |quote=as generally is the case for branching processes &amp;#x5b;in Path dependence, its critics and the quest for 'historical economics'&amp;#x5d;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as a [[Ergodic (adjective)|non-ergodic]] [[stochastic process]].

In ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959), [[Edith Penrose]] analyzed how the growth of a firm both organically and through acquisition is strongly influenced by the experience of its managers and the history of the firm's development.

==History==
{{see also|Historical institutionalism}}

Recent methodological work in comparative politics and sociology has adapted the concept of path dependence into analyses of political and social phenomena. Path dependence has primarily been used in [[Historical comparative research|comparative-historical]] analyses of the development and persistence of [[institutions]], whether they be social, political, or cultural. There are arguably two types of path-dependent processes:

* One is the "[[critical juncture]]" framework, most notably utilized by Ruth and David Collier in [[political science]]. In the critical [[wiktionary:juncture|juncture]], [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] conditions allow [[contingent]] choices that set a specific trajectory of [[institutional]] development and consolidation that is difficult to reverse. As in economics, the generic drivers are: lock-in, [[positive feedback]], [[increasing returns]] (the more a choice is made, the bigger its benefits), and [[self-reinforcement]] (which creates forces sustaining the decision).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Page | first = Scott E. | author-link = Scott E. Page | title = Path dependence | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = 88 | doi = 10.1561/100.00000006 | date = January 2006 | ref = harv }} [http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Page2006.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other path-dependent process deals with "[[reactive sequences]]" where a primary event sets off a temporally-linked and causally-tight [[deterministic]] chain of events that is nearly uninterruptible. These reactive sequences have been used to link the death of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] with welfare expansion and the [[industrial revolution]] in [[England]] with the development of the [[steam engine]].

The critical juncture framework has been used to explain the development and persistence of [[welfare states]], labor incorporation in [[Latin America]], and the variations in [[economic development]] between countries, among other things. Scholars such as Kathleen Thelen caution that the [[historical determinism]] in path-dependent frameworks is subject to constant disruption from [[Institutional economics|institutional evolution]].

==Social sciences==
[[Paul Pierson]]'s influential attempt{{specify|date=March 2017}} to [[Validity (logic)|rigorously formalize]] path dependence within political science, draws partly on ideas from economics. Herman Schwartz has questioned those efforts, arguing that forces analogous to those identified in the economic literature are not pervasive in the political realm, where the strategic exercise of power gives rise to, and transforms, institutions.

The path-dependence of [[Strategy dynamics#The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process|emergent strategy]] has been observed in behavioral [[experimental economics|experiments]] with individuals and [[Institutional memory|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egidi |first1=Massimo |last2=Narduzzo |first2=Alessandro |date=October 1997 |title=The emergence of path-dependent behaviors in cooperative contexts |journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=677–709 |url= http://www-ceel.economia.unitn.it/papers/lyon.html |doi=10.1016/S0167-7187(97)00007-6 |quote="&amp;#x5b;Some test subjects&amp;#x5d; adopted a strategy once and for all&amp;#x5b;,&amp;#x5d; and insisted on using it&amp;#x5b;,&amp;#x5d; even when the configurations could not be efficiently played with the strategy adopted."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social sciences, especially [[sociology]] and [[organizational theory]], a distinct yet closely related concept to path dependence is the concept of "imprinting", which captures how initial environmental conditions leave a persistent mark (or imprint) on organizations and organizational collectives (such as industries and communities), thus continuing to shape organizational behaviours and outcomes in the long run, even as external environmental conditions change.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Marquis |first1=Christopher |last2=Tilcsik |first2=András |title=Imprinting: Toward A Multilevel Theory |pages=193–243 |journal=[[Academy of Management Annals]] |year=2013 |ssrn=2198954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
*A general type of path dependence is a [[typological vestige]].
**In [[typography]], for example, some customs persist, although the reason for their existence no longer applies; for example, the placement of the period inside a [[Quotation mark|quotation]] in U.S. spelling. In [[movable type|metal type]], pieces of terminal punctuation, such as the comma and period, are comparatively small and delicate (as they must be [[x-height]] for proper [[kerning]].) Placing the full-height quotation mark on the outside protected the smaller [[sort (typesetting)|cast metal sort]] from damage if the word needed to be moved around within or between lines. This would be done even if the period did not belong to the text being quoted.
*[[Evolution]] is considered by some to be path-dependent: mutations occurring in the past have had long-term effects on current life forms, some of which may no longer be adaptive to current conditions. For instance, there is a controversy about whether the [[Sesamoid bone#In other animals|panda's thumb]] is a leftover trait or not.
*In the [[computer]] and [[software]] markets, [[legacy system]]s indicate path dependence: customers' needs in the present market often include the ability to read data or run programs from past generations of products. Thus, for instance, a customer may need not merely the best available [[word processor]], but rather the best available word processor that can read [[Microsoft Word]] files. Such limitations in [[Backward compatibility|compatibility]] contribute to lock-in, and more subtly, to design compromises for independently developed products, if they attempt to be compatible. Also see [[embrace, extend and extinguish]].

'''Personal Archiving''' is a branch of [[archival science]] and [[genealogy]], focusing on the capture and preservation of an individual's personal papers and other documentary output, generally by the individuals concerned.  It is often related to family history, when family historians are engaged in capturing their own living history to leave as a legacy for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nick |last1=Barratt |title=Nick Barratt's guide to your ancestors lives |page=272 |ISBN=1-84884-056-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This branch of family history is allied to the growth in activities such as photograph and record scanning which seeks to preserve materials beyond their original life.

Modern personal archiving is often concerned with [[digital preservation]], especially with collating individual's content from [[social media]] websites and ensuring the long-term preservation of this.  This often deals with migration of digital content, as a means of preservation, rather than the tradition tasks of conservation of paper-based records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why everyone has to be a historian in the digital age |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/world_news_america/8999128.stm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CHT0CEFZ |archivedate=2012-11-19 |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and Motivation==
Individuals involved in personal archiving consider all media to be relevant sources as long as this relates to the life, memories and experiences of a person. The majority of material is written, photographic, audio or video in nature. Those experiences can relate to their lives, those of living relatives or ancestors.
Those engaged in this practice also see their life experiences as a potential source of historical and cultural record, as well as being able to re-live those moments personally.  Many see the digital age as bringing an opportunity to leave a richer legacy for future generations.

== Examples of Personal Archives ==
Personal archives may not always be in the vein of genealogy. They may not always even be indicative of the individual who created the collection. A personal archive can range massively in content. For example one individual may deem their record collection as a personal archive and then another person may deem their dry-cleaning receipts worthy of retention. One such example of the latter was the actress [[Vivien Leigh]]. What will be of interest for research in the future is unpredictable. However, Leigh's laundry receipts provided insight into how mid twentieth century [[haute couture]] was preserved and presented in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b1bf5044-f5ba-11e3-afd3-00144feabdc0|title=Personal Archives: documenting the stories of our lives|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conducting Personal Archiving==
{{howto|section|date=October 2012}}
* Choose an online or offline repository to store memories, experiences and living history, where it will be secured for future generations
* Gather existing material, files, documents, scans, photographs, into one place and decide what you think is worth preserving and naming.
* Choose a categorization or organization method.
* Use preservation safe measures to secure your materials so that they last for posterity.
* Invite other family members to join and add to the archive making a family repository. From materials that you have uploaded you can make interesting representations like timelines, timecapsules photo galleries for yourself and ancestors.
* Begin capturing ongoing material, writing your memories, events and experiences, allowing you to leave a written legacy.

'''Plica''' (from [[Latin]] ''plica'' - fold) is a term from [[sigillography]] for the reinforcement of the lower edge of a [[charter]] or [[deed]], produced by folding up the bottom of the sheet of [[parchment]] to achieve a double thickness. 

The purpose of the fold is to provide a more secure anchorage for the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and to guard against the parchment being torn. Slots were normally cut in the double thickness of parchment, a cord or tag of parchment threaded through them, and the seal attached to that.

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

[[File:Tým Post Bellum.JPG|thumb|right|Post Bellum team in 2013.]]
'''Post Bellum''' is an educational [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Prague]], Czech Republic, founded in 2001. The organization was formed by a group of historians and journalists with the aim of increasing public knowledge of the 20th Century history of the Czech Republic and neighboring countries, especially among younger generations.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.postbellum.cz/wp-content/uploads/pb_promo_EN_web.pdf|title=English Brochure: Post Bellum|last=|first=|date=|website=Post Bellum|access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Post Bellum has collected thousands of witness accounts by conducting interviews with people who lived through significant periods in history as part of their documentation project, ''Stories of the 20th Century'', and for their online archive, Memory of Nations. They organize various other projects and activities to raise awareness of modern history. The stated aim of the organisation is to "understand the past through authentic testimony".&lt;ref name="brochure" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Post Bellum is an associate member organization of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

== Memory of Nations ==
The organisation has created an archive of oral historical testimony entitled ''Memory of Nations'', in partnership with the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] and [[Czech Radio]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The archive is the largest online collection of testimonies in Central Europe, documenting the stories of "war veterans, Holocaust survivors, political prisoners, as well as members of the Communist Party, the Secret Police, and the People’s Militias".&lt;ref name="brochure" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Witnesses are interviewed in their original language, then translated into English. The interviews are then archived online, where they can be browsed using different categories, dates, places, and so on, in order to locate anecdotes and interviews regarding specific events. Initially, Czech Radio provided the technical support to carry out the interviews and witness recordings, and the organisation later{{when|date=July 2018}} began using [[Eye Direct]] technology to record the testimonies. As of July 2018, there are 8281 witnesses in the database and 4499 published witnesses, as well as over 60,000 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoryofnations.eu|title=Memory of Nations|website=www.memoryofnations.eu|language=en|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have provided testimony for the database include [[Zdeňka Deitchová]], [[Augustin Bubník]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Helga Hošková-Weissová]], [[Milan Knížák]], [[František Zahrádka]], [[Felix Kolmer]], and [[Rudolf Bereza]].

Post Bellum also developed an app, Memory of Nations Sites, with an interactive map allowing users to access archive materials from the 20th century related to their current location. The app is available in English and Czech, and won the [[Vodafone#Vodafone_Foundation|Vodafone Foundation]] Prize in 2012 for the "Best Application Idea."&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

=== The Memory of Nations Awards ===
[[File:Ceny paměti národa 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Memory of Nations Award ceremony in 2011.]]The Memory of Nations Award is awarded to five recipients each year, since 2010, in recognition of bravery in standing up to totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Recipients are chosen from among 20 nominees by a panel of judges from the fields of historical research, journalism, and politics. The ceremony takes place each year on 17 November, the anniversary of the beginning of the [[Velvet Revolution]], and is broadcast live on television. Each year, the award ceremony has a different theme. In November 2014, the award was presented to people involved in resistance to the [[Iron Curtain]] in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Germany, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism in Europe]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== The Run for Memory of Nations ===
The Run for Memory of Nations is an annual long-distance run organised to remember and honour [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims, political prisoners, veterans, and dissidents.

==''Stories from the 20th Century''==
''Stories from the 20th Century'' is a radio show telling witnesses' stories from Post Bellum's ''Memory of Nations'' archive, that has aired every Sunday since 2006 on [[Czech Radio]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The people interviewed include war veterans, [[Holocaust survivors]], political prisoners of Nazi and Communist times, and members of minority groups. 

''Stories from the 20th Century'' was also the name of a documentary series that aired on [[Česká televize|Czech Television]], focused on life during [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]. The series featured interviews with [[StB]] agents, miners, members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist party]], [[LGBT|gay people]], and black market currency dealers.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

== Educational initiatives ==
[[File:My jsme to nevzdali 2009 7268.JPG|thumb|right|Open Air Exposition opening organised in 2009 by Post Bellum in [[Prague]].]]
Post Bellum is involved with a number of initiatives aimed at increasing public knowledge of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]], especially among young people. They use witness testimonies as part of workshops in schools in which students are encouraged to think critically about historical events,&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|8}} as well as "Experience Workshops", which involve immersion in historical events and students participating in role plays of events from the mid-1900s and the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]] period.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|11}} 

Another educational initiative is "Our Neighbors’ Stories",&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|9}} a program in which students record witness testimonies locally, which are then retold through radio or TV. Students also carry out research into the witnesses' situations which is presented together with the testimony.

Post Bellum has also published a number of educational books such as ''We Are Still At War'' and ''Forced Labour'', graphic novels based on true stories of people affected by totalitarian regimes.

== Other activities ==
[[File:Koncentracni tabor Mauthausen Praha 2012 7934.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of Mauthausen Concentration camp in Charles Square, Prague, 2012.]]
Post Bellum has also documented witnesses in other parts of the world, such as the United States, Poland, and Israel.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|6}} They have partnerships with the [[Visegrad Fund]] and the German [[Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future]] (EVZ) to record witness testimonies, and have also{{when|date=July 2018}} begun a partnership with [[Florida International University]] to document the testimonies of Cuban dissidents.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|6}} 

Post Bellum has put on about 128 exhibitions all around Europe.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;{{rp|17}} In May-July 2012, they built a replica of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in [[Charles Square]] in Prague as part of an exhibition to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]].

In literary and historical analysis, '''presentism''' is the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of [[cultural bias]], and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2002/against-presentism |author=[[Lynn_Hunt|Hunt, Lynn]]. |title=Against Presentism &amp;#124; AHA |publisher=''Historians.org,'' May 2002 |accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy in historical writing.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the first citation for ''presentism'' in its historiographic sense from 1916, and the word may have been used in this meaning as early as the 1870s. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] identifies presentism as a [[fallacy]] also known as the "fallacy of ''[[nunc pro tunc]]''". He has written that the "classic example" of presentism was the so-called "[[Whig history]]", in which certain 18th- and 19th-century British historians wrote history in a way that used the past to validate their own political beliefs. This interpretation was presentist because it did not depict the past in objective historical context but instead viewed history only through the lens of contemporary Whig beliefs. In this kind of approach, which emphasizes the relevance of history to the present, things that do not seem relevant receive little attention, which results in a misleading portrayal of the past. "Whig history" or "whiggishness" are often used as synonyms for ''presentism'' particularly when the historical depiction in question is [[teleology|teleological]] or [[triumphalism|triumphalist]].&lt;ref name="Fischer139"&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological analysis==
Presentism has a shorter history in sociological analysis, where it has been used to describe [[technological determinism|technological determinists]] who interpret a change in behavior as starting with the introduction of a new technology. For example, scholars such as [[Frances Cairncross]] proclaimed that the Internet had led to "the death of distance", but most [[community]] ties and many business ties had been transcontinental and even intercontinental for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry. "Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism," ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' '''25'''.2 (June, 2001): 227-52. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral judgments==
Presentism is also a factor in the problematic question of history and [[morality|moral]] judgments. Among historians, the orthodox view may be that reading modern notions of morality into the past is to commit the error of presentism. To avoid this, historians restrict themselves to describing what happened and attempt to refrain from using language that passes judgment. For example, when writing history about [[slavery]] in an era when the practice was widely accepted, letting that fact influence judgment about a group or individual would be presentist and thus should be avoided.

Critics respond that to avoid moral judgments is to practice [[moral relativism]], a controversial idea. Some religious historians argue that morality is timeless, having been established by God; they say it is not anachronistic to apply timeless standards to the past. (In this view, while [[mores]] may change, [[morality]] does not.)

Others argue that application of religious standards has varied over time as well. [[Saint Augustine]], for example, holds that there exist timeless moral principles, but contends that certain practices (such as [[polygamy]]) were acceptable in the past because they were customary but now are neither customary nor acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip, and Henry Wace. ''A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church'', Vol. III, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1908, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer, for his part, writes that while historians might not always manage to avoid the fallacy completely, they should at least try to be aware of their biases and write history in such a way that they do not create a distorted depiction of the past.&lt;ref name="Fischer139"/&gt;

'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychoanalysis]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]], and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

==Description==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22). Psychohistory holds that ritual child sacrifice  once  occurred  in most cultures.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[parenting]] practice and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the roots of violence|year=1980|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780374522698}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistorians, on the other hand, suggest that social behavior such as [[crime]] and [[war]] may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and  social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===Areas of study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The history of childhood – which looks at such questions as:
::*How have children been raised throughout history
::*How has the family been constituted
::*How and why have practices changed over time
::*The changing place and value of children in society over time
::*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed
:2. [[Psychobiography]] – which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
:3. Group psychohistory – which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the [[Loaded language|loaded terms]], [[metaphor]]s and repetitive words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
{{OR-section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- Only one of the people Wikipedia articles linked in this section makes any use of the word "psychohistory" in its body. That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the "Tanka prose" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of "practitioners" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the "history" of the "discipline" of "psychohistory" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. --&gt;
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of "psycho-history" to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

Psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of modern psychohistorical research, which uses different methods.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
[[Lloyd deMause]] has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Joseph F.|year=2009|title=Psychohistory: Creating a New Discipline|url=|journal=Journal of Psychohistory|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.

The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsFoundations"&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132–146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies ("late" infanticidal childrearing).
|-

|-
| valign="top" | Abandoning
| valign="top" | Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name="EMOL" /&gt;
| valign="top" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].

| valign="top" | The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.
| valign="top" | The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries.  early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].
|-
| valign="top" | Intrusive
| valign="top" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.
|-
| valign="top" | Socializing
| valign="top" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.

As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | Helping
| valign="top" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than "[[socialize]]" them into fulfilling parental wishes.

Psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the "helping mode") are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.  An example of this are reports of [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Gettis, J. Getis, and J. D. Fellmann (2004). ''Introduction to Geography, Ninth Edition''. New York:  McGraw-Hill, pp. 200f.&lt;/ref&gt;  regions in which  millions of women are "missing".&lt;ref&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2584811 Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy]. ''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected in political contrasts – for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W. Bush's Second Term: Saving the World, Saving the Country | journal = [[Journal of Psychohistory]] | volume = 33 | pages = 117–124 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = deMause | first = Lloyd | title = [Book review of] Jonathan Schell's ''The Seventh Decade'' | journal = Journal of Psychohistory | volume = 35 | pages = 308–309 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and in civil wars.

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{cite book

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay "The Evolution of Childhood" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of "helping mode" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] – deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to "psychohistory" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, facing criticism in the academic community,&lt;ref name="OnWriting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367–388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics referring to it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies, and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance.

DeMause has received criticism on several levels. His formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = "Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective". In ''Past, Present and Personal: The Family and The Life Course in American History''  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1986  | location = NY  | pages = 68–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the "black legend" view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been called a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources, e.g. Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800''. However, deMause received criticism for his repeated, detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical "abuses." There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336–354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23520">'''Public history''' is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of [[history]] who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[archival science]], [[oral history]], museum [[curator]]ship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are [[museums]], historic homes and [[historic site]]s, parks, battlefields, [[archives]],  film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Definition==
Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined.  Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians:
* use of the methods of the historical discipline
* an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or [[antiquarian]] purposes
* an emphasis on professional training and practice
* an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past

These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based [[National Council on Public History]]:  "To promote the utility of history in social through professional practice.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncph.org/Portals/13/About%20the%20Council/NCPHsFirstDecade.pdf Reflections on an Idea: NCPH’s First Decade]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;69–85&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, "Public history is a movement,  methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public."  However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncph.org/WhatisPublicHistory/tabid/282/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Public History Redux"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Public History News'' (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if [[shared historical authority]] should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many "publics" for public history complicates the task of definition.  For example, historian [[Peter Novick]] has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called ''private'' history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or ''popular'' history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream:  The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' (1988), 510-21&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Stanton, '' The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Kean]] and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between "historians" and "their publics"'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), ''People and their Pasts: Public History Today'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0909/0909pub1.cfm "A Picture of Public History]:  Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals" in ''Public History News'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, those who embrace the term ''public historian'' accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings.

==Related fields==

Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/3-2015-2/public-history-sublation-german-debate/ Marko Demantowsky, ''“Public History” – Sublation of a German Debate?'', Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include:
* [[Applied history]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Cultural Heritage Management]]
* [[Digital History]]
* [[Heritage Interpretation]]
* [[Historic Preservation]]
* [[Historical archaeology]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Oral History]]
* [[Public humanities]]

In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making.  This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be "public history."

==History==

Public history has many antecedents.  These include [[Museum#History museums|history museums]],  [[Historical society|historical societies]],  public and private [[archive]]s and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, [[Historic preservation|preservation organizations]], historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, [[historical fiction]]).  Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmilla Jordanova, ''The Practice of History'' (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''Public History Review'', vol 10, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Historians in Public:  the Practice of American History, 1890-1970'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, ''Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History'' (Iowa City:  University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as “public history”. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups—for example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities—rather than the  [[Great man theory|“great men”]] who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced [[social history]] as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.&lt;ref&gt;James Green, ''Taking History to Heart:  The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements'' (Amherst, Massachusetts:  [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'', p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the [[United States Bicentennial]] to multiculturalist projects in [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]], paralleled by widespread public interest in [[genealogy]], the tracing of folk and family [[Roots revival|“roots”]], and other history-related activities. In the wake of [[deindustrialization]] in many industrial places, governments also supported [[Urban renewal|regeneration or revitalization projects]] that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for [[place branding|“re-branding”]] a depressed area.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Dicks, ''Culture on Display:  The Production of Contemporary Visitability'' (Maidenhead, UK:  Open University Press, 2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] and the Canadian government's addition of “historical researcher” as a civil service category in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;John R. English, "The Tradition of Public History in Canada," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rise of [[cultural tourism]] and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field.

In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wesley Johnson, "The Origins of ''The Public Historian'' and the National Council on Public History," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of “public history” as a field in its own right.  Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field.  The launch of a professional journal, ''[[The Public Historian]]'', in 1978, and the founding of the [[National Council on Public History]] in 1979 further served to give public-minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods.

Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic “jobs crisis” in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.&lt;ref&gt;English, "Tradition of Public History in Canada"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick, "Public History in Canada:  An Introduction," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Public history also exists as an identifiable field in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]] and Paula Hamilton, “What Makes History Public?” ''Public History Review'' 1992, pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Liddington, "What is Public History?  Publics and Their Pasts, Meanings and Practices," ''Oral History'' (Spring 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. Sutcliffe, "Gleams and Echoes of Public History in Western Europe:  Before and After the Rotterdam Conference," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 6, No. 4 (Fall 1984), pp. 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; and other places. In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Public History Network|url=http://www.historiapublica.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label “public history.”  The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifph.hypotheses.org International Federation for Public History - Fédération Internationale pour l'Histoire Publique]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/PHN-2012-September1.pdf Serge Noiret: Next Steps for the International Federation, Public History News, Volume 32, Number 4, September 2012, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; IFPH is also a permanent &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html#public Internal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203723/http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal ''[[Public History Weekly]]''.

Public history continues to develop and define itself.  There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with [[digital history]], with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge.  In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual [http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=105 NCPH Book Award].  In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians’ sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn Létourneau, and David Northrup, "Canadians and Their Pasts:  An Exploration in Historical Consciousness," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  While high-profile “history wars” have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, [[History wars|Australia's]] ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples,  the furor over [[Jack Granatstein]]’s 1998 book “Who Killed Canadian History?”, or the 1994 controversy over the [[National Museum of American History]]'s planned exhibit on the [[Enola Gay#Recent developments|Enola Gay]] bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings.

An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like [[If This House Could Talk]] are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html  |title= Connecting Neighbors through their buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Quantitative history''' is an approach to [[history|historical research]] that makes use of [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], [[statistical]] and [[computer]] tools. It is considered a branch of ''social science history'' and has four leading journals: ''Historical Methods'' (1967- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heldref.org/hm.php Historical Methods online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043317/http://www.heldref.org/hm.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]'' (1968- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jih/ Journal of Interdisciplinary History online]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Social Science History'' (1976- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/ Social Science History online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''] (2010- ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative historians start with databases. Large quantities of economic and demographic data are available in print format. Quantifiers move these into computerized databases. The largest repository is the [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]] (ICPSR) at the [[University of Michigan]], which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the [[United States]] and the world.

== Data bases: economic ==

[[Economic historian]]s use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

''[[Content analysis]]'' is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby newspapers, magazines or similar sources are numerically coded according to a standardized list of topics. [Neuendorf, ''The Content Analysis Guidebook'' (2002)]

== Political history ==

Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.  '''Collective biography'' uses standardized information on a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

== New social history ==

The "new [[social historian]]s" (new in the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, and migrations and population changes.

An especially challenging technique is linking names ("nominal record linkage") of the same person whose information appears in multiple source such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

== Cliodynamics ==
[[Cliodynamics]] employs a scientific approach to the study of history and combines insights from [[cultural evolution]], [[macrosociology]], and [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]] to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

== Topics ==

In 2007-2008, the most viewed articles in ''Social Science History'' represented the breadth and style of the field. The five most viewed were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/reports/mfr1.dtl Reports], dukejournals.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--not working, 5 May 20019--&gt;

'''Settle Stories''' is a registered charity and company founded in 2010 by Sita Brand to promote storytelling for individuals, communities and organisations. 

== History ==
In 2010, Sita Brand, a performance storyteller, theatre director, writer, and producer, established Settle Stories in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], a small market town in [[North Yorkshire]]. Brand proposed a storytelling festival for the town and set about obtaining funding for her idea.  Her aims were:
# To increase access to traditional and modern forms of storytelling.
# To improve the storytelling skills of users.
# To increase the availability of, access to, and diversity of stories and storytelling.
At the core of the initiative was a belief by Brand in the power of storytelling to help people learn and communicate universal truths. Brand believes that stories ignite the imagination in ways that help people to listen, learn, make emotional connections with ideas and effectively communicate with others. She also saw the festival as a way of contributing to the economic development of the market town.

Funding was obtained from the [[Arts Council England]], with additional contributions from Craven District Council, Settle Town Council. The first Settle Stories Storytelling Festival was successfully launched in 2010, involving professional storytellers, musicians and other artists. Over 500 people attended, with a similar number of local children taking part in schools-based workshops.

Following the success of the 2010 festival, Settle Stories became a registered charity (registered charity no.1141649). Subsequent festivals in each of the following years saw a steady increase in visitors, with over 1,000 attending the 2013 event. The festival has since grown to become the largest storytelling festival in the north of England with over 50 events in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.junomagazine.com/settle-stories-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Settle Stories established the W R Mitchell Archive, which is a unique collection of audio and visual recordings of life in the [[North West of England]], particularly the [[Yorkshire Dales]].  The charity is now in the process of digitising the material and making it available as a resource for learning (see below).

In August 2012, the charity obtained an office in Settle Town Hall.  It has two members of staff but employs others, including performers at the festivals, on a freelance and consultative basis. It has a team of trustees and volunteers, and its Patron is [[Mike Harding]], a well-known Yorkshire author, broadcaster, performer and storyteller.

By 2013, Settle Stories had involved the following stakeholders in its work:
* Local community: including children and young people, families, and schools.
* Visitors: including those specifically drawn to the Festival, and visitors to the region, drawn to the Dales, and attending the Festival as part of their visit.
* Artists: storytellers, musicians, visual artists and other performers at the annual festival.
* Local Businesses: hotels and guest houses, restaurants and shops.
* Volunteers: who willingly give their time and expertise to support the aims of the charity.
* Suppliers: supplying materials for the Festival and other Settle Stories activities.
* Funders: [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]], Craven District Council, Settle Town Council, Trusts and Foundations, commercial sponsors and individuals.

== W R Mitchell Archive ==
The W R Mitchell Archive is a collection of oral history recordings, photographs and other materials collected by Dr W R Mitchell over a 60-year period to record the history of Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire.

Dr Mitchell (1928 - 2015) was a journalist, historian, and author of over 100 books and articles on the Dales.  He joined ''The Dalesman'' magazine in 1948 and was its editor from 1968&amp;ndash;88. From the 1980s onward, Bill toured the region recording on cassette tape the memories of local people on a wide range of topics, but particularly the everyday experiences of people, as remembered and told by Dales people in their own words and dialects.  In 1996, in recognition of his work, he was awarded the MBE and was made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Bradford.

By 2010, Dr Mitchell had amassed a collection of over 300 audio tapes, with an accompanying collection of photographs and some video footage, of his interviewees.

In January 2012, Settle Stories received a £50,000 Heritage Lottery Fund Grant for a pilot project to digitise a selection of cassette tapes and make the recordings available online.

'''Simon Pelloutier''' (Oct. 27, 1694 – Oct. 3, 1757) was a French historian, was born at [[Leipzig|Leipsic]], Germany, Oct. 27, 1694. His father, a merchant established at [[Lyon|Lyons]], had been driven from France by the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Aided by an excellent memory and a strong desire to educate himself, he studied at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], at [[Berlin]], and [[Geneva]]. Admitted to the evangelical ministry, he served the French churches of [[Buchholterberg|Buchholtz]] (1715), of [[Magdeburg|Madgeburg]] (1719), and of Berlin (1725), where he was the colleague of Lentant. In 1743 he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences at Berlin]], and was chosen for its librarian in 1745. He died at Berlin Oct. 3, 1757. 

His principal work is, ''Histoiare des Celtes et particulierement des Gaulois et des Germains depuis les temps fabuleux jusqua la prise de Roze par les Gaulois'' (La Haye, 1740-1750, 2 vols. 12mo). This edition is full of faults; Chiniac de la Bastide has given a second, revised and enlarged after the MSS. of the author (Paris, 1771, 2 vols. 4to, or 8 vols. 12mo), which was translated into German by Purmann (Frankfort, 1777-1784, 3 vols. 8vo). "This work," says the ''Journal des Savants,'' "is very curious and agreeable in many respects; it is full of an extremely varied erudition. The author, not satisfied with proving what he advances, always accompanies his proofs with judicious reflections, from which he afterwards draws very extended conclusions, calculated to throw light upon the history and antiquities of all the different peoples of Europe." The editor has added to the ''Histoire des Celtes'' several dissertations by Pelloutier; among others the ''Discours sur les Galates,'' which gained for him in 1742 a prize from the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|French Academy of Inscriptions]]. See Brucker, ''Pinacotheca,'' dec. 3, No. 9; Formey, ''Eloges;'' Haag, ''La France Protestante.''

==The World-Island and the Heartland==
[[Image:Heartland.png|right|500px|Map of the "Heartland Theory", as published by Mackinder in 1904.]]
According to Mackinder, the Earth's land surface was divisible into:
*The '''World-Island''', comprising the interlinked continents of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. This was the largest, most populous, and richest of all possible land combinations.
*The '''offshore islands''', including the [[British Isles]] and the [[Japan|islands of Japan]].
*The '''outlying islands''', including the [[continents]] of [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Australia]].

The '''Heartland''' lay at the centre of the world island, stretching from the [[Volga]] to the [[Yangtze]] and from the [[Himalayas]] to the [[Arctic]]. Mackinder's Heartland was the area then ruled by the [[Russian Empire]] and after that by the [[Soviet Union]], minus the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] region, which is located in the easternmost part of Russia, near the Aleutian Islands and Kurile islands.

==Strategic importance of Eastern Europe==
Later, in 1919, Mackinder summarised his theory as:
:::"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland;
:::who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island;
:::who rules the World-Island commands the world."
:::(Mackinder, ''Democratic Ideals and Reality'', p. 150)

Any power which controlled the World-Island would control well over 50% of the world's resources. The Heartland's size and central position made it the key to controlling the World-Island.

The vital question was how to secure control for the Heartland. This question may seem pointless, since in 1904 the [[Russian Empire]] had ruled most of the area from the Volga to Eastern Siberia for centuries. But throughout the nineteenth century:
*The West European powers had combined, usually successfully, in the [[Great Game]] to prevent Russian expansion.
*The Russian Empire was huge but socially, politically and technologically backward—i.e., inferior in "virility, equipment and organization".

Mackinder held that effective political domination of the Heartland by a single power had been unattainable in the past because:
*The Heartland was protected from sea power by ice to the north and mountains and deserts to the south.
*Previous land invasions from east to west and vice versa were unsuccessful because lack of efficient transportation made it impossible to assure a continual stream of men and supplies.

He outlined the following ways in which the Heartland might become a springboard for global domination in the twentieth century (Sempa, 2000):
*Successful invasion of Russia by a West European nation (most probably [[Germany]]). Mackinder believed that the introduction of the [[railroad]] had removed the Heartland's invulnerability to land invasion. As [[Eurasia]] began to be covered by an extensive network of railroads, there was an excellent chance that a powerful continental nation could extend its political control over the [[Eastern Europe]]an gateway to the Eurasian landmass. In Mackinder's words, "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland."
*A Russo-German alliance. Before 1917 both countries were ruled by [[Autocracy|autocrat]]s (the [[Tsar]] and the [[Kaiser]]), and both could have been attracted to an alliance against the democratic powers of Western Europe (the US was [[isolationist]] regarding European affairs, until it became a participant of [[World War I]] in 1917). Germany would have contributed to such an alliance its formidable army and its large and growing sea power.
*Conquest of Russia by a Sino-Japanese empire (see below).
The combined empire's large East Asian coastline would also provide the potential for it to become a major sea power. Mackinder's "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland ..." does not cover this scenario, probably because the previous 2 scenarios were seen as the major risks of the nineteenth century and the early 1900s.

One of Mackinder's personal objectives was to warn Britain that its traditional reliance on sea power would become a weakness as improved land transport opened up the Heartland for invasion and / or industrialisation (Sempa, 2000).

==Influence of the theory on foreign and military policy==
[[Image:Pivot area.png|thumb|500px|Colour representation, using a modern projection of the world.]]

===In the Western powers===
Mackinder identified the geopolitical nightmare that was to haunt the world's two sea powers during the first half of the twentieth century—[[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and, later the [[United States]].

==Influence of the theory on other geopolitical models==
Signs of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], particularly in his "[[Intermediate Region]]" model. There is a significant geographical overlap between the Heartland or "Pivot Area" and the Intermediate Region, with the exception of [[Germany]]-[[Prussia]] and north-eastern [[China]], which Kitsikis excludes from the Intermediate Region. Mackinder, on the other hand, excludes [[North Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] from the Heartland. The reason for this difference is that Mackinder's model is primarily geo-strategic, while Kitsikis' model is geo-civilizational. However, the roles of both the Intermediate Region and the Heartland are regarded by their respective authors as being pivotal in the shaping of world history.

==Criticism==
K. S. Gadzhev, in his book ''Vvedenie v geopolitiku'' (''Introduction to Geopolitics'') raises a series of objections to Mackinder's Heartland to start with that the significance physiography is given there for [[political strategy]] is a form of [[geographical determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Sengupta, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGn8qSgtc08C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Heartlands of Eurasia: The Geopolitics of Political Space]'', Lexington Books, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

The '''Ussher chronology''' is a 17th-century [[chronology]] of the [[history]] of the world [[Biblical literalist chronology|formulated from a literal reading]] of the [[Old Testament]] by [[James Ussher]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The chronology is sometimes associated with [[young Earth creationism]], which holds that the Universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the [[Books of the Bible|biblical book]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].  Ussher fell into disrepute in the 19th century.

Published in 1650, the full title of Ussher's work in Latin is ''Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the beginnings of [[Maccabees]]").

Ussher's work was his contribution to the long-running theological debate on the age of the [[Earth]]. This was a major concern of many [[Christian]] scholars over the centuries.

The chronology is sometimes called the Ussher{{endash}}Lightfoot chronology because [[John Lightfoot]] published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that the first day of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] fell upon, October 23, 4004&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], near the [[autumnal equinox]]. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.

Ussher's proposed date of [[4004 BC]] differed little from [[Dating Creation#Date of Creation according to the Pentateuch|other Biblically-based estimates]], such as those of [[Jose ben Halafta]] (3761 BC), [[Bede]] (3952 BC), Ussher's near-contemporary [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]] (3949 BC), [[Johannes Kepler]] (3992 BC) or [[Sir Isaac Newton]] (c. 4000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Hay|title=Experimenting on a Small Planet: A Scholarly Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teJYlWH9vg4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=November 17, 2013|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642285608|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2017}} Ussher was influenced by the same account as the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], dating the worldwide flood to 2349 BC and the birth of [[Terah]] in 2127 BC. The date of 4000 BC as the creation of [[Adam]] was at least partially influenced by the widely held belief that the Earth was approximately 5600 years old (2000 to Abraham, 2000 from Abraham to the birth of [[Christ (title)|Christ]], and 1600 years from Christ to Ussher), corresponding to the six days of Creation, on the grounds that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|3:8|KJV}}). This tradition was believed to indicate that Jesus would return in 2000 AD,&lt;ref name="Newport2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth G. C. Newport|title=Apocalypse and millennium: studies in biblical eisegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Cm9ALJbe0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=28 August 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77334-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RowlandBarton2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Rowland|author2=John Barton|title=Apocalyptic in history and tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrcoAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=978-0-8264-6208-4|pages=233–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than six thousand years after 4004 BC. Modern proponents of this interpretation hold that the creation date 4004 BC could be inaccurate.

==Ussher's methods==
The chronologies of Ussher and other biblical scholars corresponded so closely because they used much the same methodology to calculate key events recorded in the [[Bible]]. Establishing the chronologies is complicated by the fact that the Bible was compiled by different authors over several centuries with lengthy chronological gaps, making it difficult to do a simple totaling of Biblical ages and dates. In his article on Ussher's calendar, James Barr has identified three distinct periods that Ussher and others had to tackle:&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:'''603–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "''Creation to Abraham's migration.''" This section is fairly easy to calculate, using the chronological data in Genesis 5 and 11, which gives an unbroken male lineage, with dates, from the creation to Abraham being called out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ussher uses the chronology found in the Masoretic text instead of the alternative chronologies found in the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch. Ussher fixed this period as 2082 years, from 4004 to 1922 BC.
# ''"Abraham's migration to Solomon's temple."'' Ussher wrote the time from Abram leaving Haran to the Exodus was 430 years (400 years of persecution, 30 years after left Haran) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/AnnalsOfTheWorld/Annals#page/n23/mode/2up|title=Annals of the World|last=Ussher|first=James|publisher=|year=1650|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse||1 Kings|6|KJV}} gives 480 years from the Exodus to the beginning of Solomon's temple in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. These 910 years span from 1922 to 1012 BC.
# ''"Period of the temple laid to the Babylonian captivity."'' This period is the most difficult to calculate, due to repeated difficulties in correlating the regnal years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The simple addition of the reigns of Judah's kings gives 430 years, but by positing a few overlapping reigns, Ussher shortens this to 424 years: 1012 to 588 BC.

After reckoning the years from creation to the last kings of Judah, Ussher used {{bibleverse|2 Kings|25:27}} to establish the length of time from the creation to the accession of Babylonian king Amel-Marduk (also known as Evil-Merodach).&lt;ref name="barr-marduk"&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 579-580.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used information from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sources to fix the date of Amel-Marduk's enthronment at 562 BC (after Nebuchadnezzar's death), from which he was able to deduce a creation in 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="barr-marduk" /&gt;

In fixing the date of Jesus' birth, Ussher took account of an error perpetrated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]], the founder of the [[Anno Domini]] numbering system. Ussher chose 5 BC as Christ's birth year&lt;ref name=Epistle/&gt; because [[Josephus]] indicated that the death of [[Herod the Great]] occurred in 4 BC.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Pratt, [http://www.johnpratt.com/items/docs/herod/herod.html "Yet another eclipse for Herod"], ''The Planetarian'', vol. 19, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the Gospel of Matthew to be correct, Jesus could not have been born after that date.

The season in which Creation occurred was the subject of considerable [[theology|theological]] debate in Ussher's time. Many scholars proposed it had taken place in the spring, the start of the Babylonian, Chaldean and other cultures' chronologies. Others, including Ussher, thought it more likely that it had occurred in the [[autumn]], largely because that season marked the beginning of the Jewish year.

Ussher further narrowed down the date by using the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] to establish the "first day" of creation as falling on a Sunday near the autumnal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 591.&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the week was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish calendar is Saturday—hence, Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s ''Tabulae Rudolphinae'' (''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday, October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:16|KJV}}. Modern equations place the autumnal equinox of 4004 BC on Sunday, October 23 (by the Julian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html Calendrica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |date=2005-02-16 }} The position of the Sun at the autumnal equinox is 180°, where 0° is its position at the vernal equinox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's understanding of creation placed the "first day" referred to in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|KJV}} on October 23, but with a "pre-creation" event, which he identified as the "beginning of time" occurring the previous night.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Ussher referred to his dating of creation on the first page of ''Annales'' in Latin and on the first page of its English translation ''Annals of the World'' (1658). In the following extract from the English translation, the phrase "in the year of the Julian Calendar" refers to the Julian Period, of which year 1 is 4713 BC, and therefore year 710 is 4004 BC.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Ge. 1:1 This beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year of the Julian Calendar, 710.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ussher provides a slightly different time in his "Epistle to the Reader" in his Latin and English works:&lt;ref name=Epistle&gt;James Ussher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrHER1jYzhIC&amp;pg=PA9 "Epistle to the Reader"], ''Annals of the World'' (2003) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "I deduce that the time from the creation until midnight, January 1, 1 AD was 4003 years, seventy days and six hours." Six hours before midnight would be 6 pm.

==Ussher's chronology today==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century, Ussher's chronology came under increasing attack from supporters of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], who argued that Ussher's "young Earth" was incompatible with the increasingly accepted view of an Earth much more ancient than Ussher's.  It became generally accepted that the Earth was tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. Ussher fell into disrepute among [[theology|theologian]]s as well; in 1890, Princeton professor [[William Henry Green]] wrote a highly influential article in ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' entitled "Primeval Chronology" in which he strongly criticised Ussher. He concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We conclude that the Scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of Abraham; and that the Mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the Flood or of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-5-the-decree-of-creation/primeval-chronology-by-dr-william-henry-green/ Primeval Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarly conservative theologian [[B. B. Warfield]] reached the same conclusion in "On The Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race",&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Theological Review'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; commenting that "it is precarious in the highest degree to draw chronological inferences from genealogical tables".

Nevertheless, Professor [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] (then Oriel Professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University) wrote in 1984:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
…probably, so far as I know, there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1–11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that… the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story…&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, Oriel professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University, England, in a letter to David C. C. Watson, April 23, 1984. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archbishop Ussher's chronology has in recent years been subject to artistic criticism, including in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (based on the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]) and the [[fantasy]] novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' which alleges that "he is off by a quarter of an hour". A different viewpoint comes from [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who, while totally disagreeing with Ussher's chronology, nevertheless wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | title = Fall in the House of Ussher | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould]] | journal = Natural History | volume = 100 |date = November 1991 | pages = 12–21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303202324/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | archivedate = March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall be defending Ussher's chronology as an honorable effort for its time and arguing that our usual ridicule only records a lamentable small-mindedness based on mistaken use of present criteria to judge a distant and different past
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ussher represented the best of scholarship in his time. He was part of a substantial research tradition, a large community of intellectuals working toward a common goal under an accepted methodology…

The Victorian Community History Awards are held annually to recognise the contributions made by Victorians in the preservation of the State’s history, and to recognise excellence in historical research. The effect of the VCHA over the period from 1998 to the present has been the stimulation of community history, the lifting of standards and the fostering of diversity and originality. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Victorian Community History Awards''' were established and sponsored in 1997 by  '''Information [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'''. The judges have always been appointed by the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and among the first were Professor [[Weston Bate]], Professor [[A. G. L. Shaw]], and senior journalist at ''The Age'', John Lahey. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding was suspended in 2006 to provide additional funds for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.  After 2010 Information Victoria Bookshop withdrew support for the program, but after a vigorous campaign by the RHSV for the continuance of the Awards, the Baillieu government accepted a submission from the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] (PROV) to continue the program for a further four-year period. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;    

From 2011 the Awards were administered by the RHSV in partnership with PROV.&lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
