'''Amati''' is the last name of a family of [[Italy|Italian]] [[violin]] makers who lived at [[Cremona]] from about 1538 to 1740. Their importance is considered equal to those of the [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], [[Guarneri]], and [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]] families. Today, violins created by Nicolò Amati are valued at around $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm Violin Price Histories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210444/http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}, violinadvisor.com, accessed 18 martie 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family members==

===Andrea Amati===
{{main|Andrea Amati}}
'''Andrea Amati''' ({{circa|1505}}{{snd}}{{circa|1578}}) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby [[Brescia]] experimented, such as Gasparo da Salò, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.

The first violin was ordered by [[Lorenzo De Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called "The King" in 1538 [1]{{Clarify|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Does this bracketed number mean the first instrument Amati produced in that year, January [or possibly March, considering that Italian years at the time were often reckoned as starting in that month], or is it an artifact from a cut-and-paste job from a possibly copyrighted webpage?--&gt;) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[Catherine De Medici|Catherine de Médicis]] the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[Charles IX of France]]. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.

Ed. Robin Stowell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. 1–29. {{doi|10.1017/CCOL9780521390330.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio and Girolamo Amati ===
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons [[Antonio Amati]] ({{circa|1537}}–1607) and [[Girolamo Amati]] ({{circa|1551}}–1630). "The Brothers Amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[Gasparo da Salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&amp;nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Nicolo Amati===
{{main|Nicolò Amati}}
'''Nicolò Amati''' (December 3, 1596{{snd}}April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amati|volume=1|page=783}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "Grand Amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]] and [[Andrea Guarneri]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)

=== Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) ===
The last maker of the family was Nicolò's son, [[Girolamo Amati]], known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649{{snd}}February 21, 1740). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives). The location of that land as well as his conclusions are controversial.|author=Gerhard Pollauer&lt;ref name="GP107"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollauer |first1=Gerhard |title=The Lost History of the Amazons: Recent research findings on the legendary women nation |date=2010 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-4461-9305-1 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z8TAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A9781446193051&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=intercourse&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm. Mar. Mag. p. 488, ed. Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Battle of the Amazons - WGA20302.jpg|thumb|310px|''[[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|Battle of the Amazons]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==
[[File:Amazone auf Sondermarke.jpg|thumb|Amazon on a special stamp promoting German horse races in the 1930s.]]
[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which lasted from March 20 – May 1, 2003, resulted in a small number of American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] [[prisoner of war|POWs]].

==507th's wrong turn==
A majority of the prisoners of war were captured from the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/world/after-the-war-inquiry-report-says-errors-and-fatigue-led-to-ambush-of-convoy.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: INQUIRY; Report Says Errors and Fatigue Led to Ambush of Convoy|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|date=7/10/2003|work=New York Times|access-date=11/3/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:

|}

==Capture==
When they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. "I thought they were going to kill me," he said. "That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are 
you going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.pows/index.html|title=Former POW: 'We were like Custer'|accessdate=2006-12-18 |publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi TV Interview==
Soon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released.  After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by [[Al Jazeera]]. In the interview, [[Patrick Miller (soldier)|Private First Class Patrick Miller]] was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was "I come to fix broke stuff." Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, "No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them."
&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-23-pows-iraq-usat_x.htm|title=Iraq puts captive troops on TV|accessdate=2006-12-18 |agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2003|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two More Makes Eight==
On March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and [[Ron Young (US Army officer)|Ronald Young Jr.]], 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the [[2003 attack on Karbala|attack on Karbala.]]

==Relocation==
The prisoners were taken to [[Baghdad]], where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab [[prison]] with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.

==Rescue==
As it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon]] which was a part of [[Task Force Tripoli]] that had been pushing up toward [[Tikrit]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s hometown.  A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.

On April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight.  Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to "stand up if you're American!"  Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis.  "At first," [[Shoshana Johnson|Spc. Shoshana Johnson]] remembers that, "they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' "&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL|title=Freedom for 7 American POWs|accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Peter Baker, Washington Post|date=
April 14, 2003|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight.  "I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'" Johnson said.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==War crimes==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[Saddam Fedayeen]] irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.

Sergeant [[Donald Walters]] was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/iraq.pow/index.html Status changed for soldier killed in Iraq: Investigation shows POW was murdered - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Lynch]] was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/usa.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530205/Soldier-killed-in-convoy-ambush-'was-alive-for-four-hours-surrounded-by-mob'.html Soldier killed in convoy ambush 'was alive for four hours surrounded by mob' - The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of [[Ash Shatrah]] and hung in the town square. His body was later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. His body was discovered by American forces on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special45/articles/profiles-part1.html |title=Invasion: Into the breach |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID%3D3750 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910142414/http://www.defenselink.mil/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=3750 |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 2004, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the showing of captured soldiers on television, as was done with some of the captured soldiers of the [[507th Maintenance Company]], was a violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].

[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Third Volume of a 1727 edition of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' printed by Jacob Tonson]]

A '''biography''', or simply '''bio''', is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or [[curriculum vitae]] ([[résumé]]), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.

Biographical works are usually [[non-fiction]], but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the [[genre]] known as biography.

An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''[[autobiography]]''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or [[ghostwriter]].

== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kendall}}

=== Historical biography&lt;!--'Historical biography' redirects here--&gt; ===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|right|Einhard as scribe]]

One of the earliest biographers was [[Cornelius Nepos]], who published his work ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by [[Plutarch]], in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators [[Demosthenes]] and [[Cicero]], or the generals [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]]; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is [[The Twelve Caesars|''De vita Caesarum'']] ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by [[Suetonius]], written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]].

In the early [[Middle Ages]] (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Hermit]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[priest]]s used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the [[Church Fathers|church father]]s, [[martyr]]s, [[pope]]s, and [[saint]]s. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]] (see [[Hagiography]]). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the [[Vita Karoli Magni|life of Charlemagne]] by his courtier [[Einhard]].

In [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic Civilization]] (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of [[Muhammad]] and other important figures in the early [[history of Islam]] began to be written, beginning the [[Prophetic biography]] tradition. Early [[Biographical dictionary|biographical dictionaries]] were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the [[prophets of Islam]] and [[Sahaba|their companions]], with one of these early examples being ''[[The book of The Major Classes (book)|The Book of The Major Classes]]'' by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.{{sfn|Nawas|2006|p=110}}

[[File:Foxe's Book of Martyrs - Frontispiece (1761).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', was one of the earliest English-language biographies.]]
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of [[monarch|king]]s, [[knight]]s, and [[tyrant]]s began to appear. The most famous of such biographies was ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by Sir [[Thomas Malory]]. The book was an account of the life of the fabled [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Following Malory, the new emphasis on [[humanism]] during the [[Renaissance]] promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.

[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller". Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century and the gradual increase in [[literacy]].

Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by [[Thomas Fuller]]'s ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.

Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC ''A General History of the Robberies &amp; Murders of the most Notorious Pirates'', by Charles Johnson]. Introduction and commentary by [[David Cordingly]]. Conway Maritime Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The American biography followed the English model, incorporating [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}{{sfn|Stone|1982}}{{clear}}

=== Emergence of the genre ===
[[File:James Boswell of Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|[[James Boswell]] wrote what many consider to be the first modern biography, ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', in 1791.]]

The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters [[Samuel Johnson]] published in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |title=James Boswell's 'Life of Johnson': The First Modern Biography |last=Butler |first=Paul |date=19 April 2012 |website=University of Mary Washington Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111164251/http://libraries.umw.edu/blog/2012/04/19/james-boswells-life-of-johnson-the-first-modern-biography/ |archive-date=11 November 2014 |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern [[genre]] of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the [[English language]]. Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |date=16 May 2013 |title=James Boswell: The Man who Re-Invented Biography |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-22540020 |website=BBC News |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar [[hagiography|hagiographical]] method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of [[saint]]s produced in [[Medieval era|Medieval]] times. A distinction between mass biography and [[Biography in literature|literary biography]] began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and [[middle-class]] culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable [[paperback]] editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. [[Periodical]]s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.{{sfn|Casper|1999}}

[[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Literary Gossip |newspaper=The Week |location=Toronto |date=6 December 1883 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=13 |url = https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n7/mode/1up |access-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), philosophers, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], churchmen – [[John Henry Newman]] – and entertainers – [[P. T. Barnum]].

=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new century’s biographies.{{sfn|Stone|1982}} The demise of the [[Great man theory|"great man"]] theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through [[Darwinian]] theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of [[psychoanalysis]] led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy.{{sfn|Casper|1999}} The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.

[[File:Eminent Victorians title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' set the standard for 20th century biographical writing, when it was published in 1918.]]
British critic [[Lytton Strachey]] revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the [[Victorian era]]: [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Thomas Arnold]], and [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Levy (journalist) |date=20 July 2002 |title=A String Quartet in Four Movements |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strachey set out to breathe life into the [[Victorian era]] for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortège'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes....of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Jones |first1=Malcolm |date=28 October 2009 |title=Boswell, Johnson, &amp; the Birth of Modern Biography |url=http://www.newsweek.com/boswell-johnson-birth-modern-biography-81357 |magazine=Newsweek |location=New York |issn=0028-9604 |access-date=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included [[Gamaliel Bradford (biographer)|Gamaliel Bradford]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Emil Ludwig]], among others. [[Robert Graves]] (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By [[World War I]], cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."

The feminist scholar [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun|Carolyn Heilbrun]] observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of [[Feminism|feminist]] activism. She cited [[Nancy Milford|Nancy Milford's]] 1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because "[only] in 1970 were we ready to read not that [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] had destroyed [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of [[May Sarton|May Sarton's]] ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."{{sfn|Heilbrun|1988|pp=12, 13}}

===Recent years===
In recent years, [[multimedia]] biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary [[biographical film]]s, [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[The Biography Channel]], and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].

CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist [[Ralph Ueltzhoeffer]]. Media scholar [[Lev Manovich]] says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways.{{sfn|Manovich|2001|p=220}} General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.{{sfn|Hughes|2009|p=159}}

In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfson College at Oxford University, [[Hermione Lee]] argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; it will be the way they remembered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Stephen Frears|Frears, Stephen]]; [[Katie Derham|Derham, Katie]]; [[Hermione Lee|Lee, Hermione]]; [[Ray Monk|Monk, Ray]] |title=The Art of Life: Are Biographies Fiction? |url=http://iai.tv/video/the-art-of-life |publisher=Institute of Arts and Ideas |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.{{sfn|Regard|2003}}

Daniel R. Meister in 2017 argues that:
:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. Meister, "The biographical turn and the case for historical biography" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical research===
[[Biographical research]] is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography” or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials".{{sfn|Roberts|2002}} The central aim of biographical research is to produce rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions", which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked".{{sfn|Zinn|2004|p=3}} This method can be used to understand an individual’s life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.

=== Critical issues ===
There are many largely unacknowledged pitfalls to writing good biographies, and these largely concern the relation between firstly the individual and the context, and, secondly, the private and public. Paul James writes:
{{cquote| The problems with such conventional biographies are manifold. Biographies usually treat the public as a reflection of the private, with the private realm being assumed to be foundational. This is strange given that biographies are most often written about public people who project a ''persona''. That is, for such subjects the dominant passages of the presentation of themselves in everyday life are already formed by what might be called a ‘self-biofication’ process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Paul |title=Closing Reflections: Confronting Contradictions in Biographies of Nations and Peoples |journal=Humanities Research |date=2013 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=124 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3231040/Confronting_Contradictions_in_Biographies_of_Nations_and_Persons_2013_}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Galahad]], Bors the Younger, and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail ([[Edward Burne-Jones]] C. 1895)]]

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

Heraldic '''[[Label (heraldry)|labels]]''' are used to [[cadency|differentiate]] the personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of members of the [[royal family of the United Kingdom]] from that of the monarch and from each other.  In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to "difference" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family.  This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels [[argent]]: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1909), p.&amp;nbsp;494.  (Online texts at https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft or http://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~bprince/hr/foxdavies/index.htm .)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.

==The label==
{{Main|Label (heraldry)}}
In the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families.  In the British royal family, all labels are ''[[argent]]'' (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the Prince of Wales]] is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.

The system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red [[St George's cross|crosses of St George]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]] &amp; [[John Brooke-Little]]: ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1997). {{ISBN|0-316-64141-3}}. "Signs of Differencing" (pp. 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt; This red cross represents England and its [[patron saint]], and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]) before the death of his father [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in 1376. Other charges used:
* A '''blue anchor''', a symbol of hope, or of naval service, as borne by several Dukes of York.
* The '''Crown''' of England (sometimes called the Imperial or [[St Edward's Crown]]) borne by the abdicated king the [[Duke of Windsor]], which is as unusual as the occurrence itself.
* '''[[Rose (symbolism)|Roses]]''': the [[Tudor Rose]] (combined red and white) has been used as an English [[Royal Supporters of England|royal badge]] since 1485.
* Red '''[[heart (symbol)|hearts]]''' may allude to the arms of [[Lüneburg]] (part of the Hanoverian arms) or – for the descendants of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark – to the [[coat of arms of Denmark]].
* The blue '''[[fleur-de-lis]]''' appears amongst the Royal Badges in England of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].
* The '''[[thistle#Heraldry|thistle]]''' is an ancient badge of [[Scotland]].
* The '''escallop shell''' was traditionally a token of pilgrimage on the [[Way of St James]].  The shell in the labels of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry]] alludes to their [[Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's Spencer]] arms.
* The '''bee''' is a canting charge in the label of [[Princess Beatrice of York]].
* The '''[[trefoil]]''' is a badge of Ireland, associated with [[St Patrick]], who used it to illustrate the [[doctrine of the Trinity]].

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

&lt;!--[[Image:Cipitio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cipitio is the most popular character of Salvadoran mythology.]]--&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is a legendary character found in [[El Salvador|salvadoran]] folklore revolving around the [[Siguanaba]] and [[Cadejo]] legends.  He is generally portrayed as an  8- to 10-year-old boy with a big conical wizard hat.  His name is taken from the [[Nahuatl]] word for child: "Cipit" or "Cipote". Some also relate his name to the deity [[Xipe Totec]].

According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La [[Siguanaba]], and "Lucero de la mañana" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair.  When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god [[Teotl]]. Ziguet and ''Cipitio'' were cursed and condemned by [[Teotl]].  Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents.  Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that '''Cipitio''' has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is represented as liking to eat ashes,&lt;ref&gt;Kephart.&lt;/ref&gt; throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies,&lt;ref&gt;Cordova 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and likes to eat a variety of [[banana]] called "Guineo Majoncho". He could also "[[Teleportation|Teleport]]" anywhere he wants.

A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book ''Cuentos de Cipotes'' by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador [[Salarrué]].

In a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons. Each episode features the problems that Salvadoran children find in their communities, families and schools, Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

The '''coat of arms of the King of Spain''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the monarch of Spain. The current version of the monarch's coat of arms was adopted in 2014 but is of much older origin. The arms marshal the arms of the former monarchs of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

Traditionally, coats of arms did not belong to a nation but to the monarch who would quarter his shield with territorial claims of his dynasty. Formerly, the Spanish monarch's arms were much more complex than they are today. It would feature the arms of the various territories of this dynasty. A simpler version of these arms, known as the ''lesser arms'', would also be used; This lesser arms were another set of arms within the centre of the full arms. During the later part of the Bourbon dynasty this would be quarterly Castille and Leon.

In 1868, during the [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|provisional government]] that followed the overthrow of Queen [[Isabella II]], an arms of ''national character'' was adopted; This 1868 arms created the present-day arrangement of elements in the shield. The "national arms" and "royal arms" would coexist after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1931, the royal arms was revised to incorporate what had been hitherto the "national arms" into the royal arms and to replace the former lesser arms of the King (i.e. quarterly Castille and Leon). The monarchy would later be abolished later that year.

When don Juan Carlos, grandson of Alfonso XIII (the last king of Spain), was chosen to be the successor of General [[Francisco Franco]], the arms adopted for his use in 1971 as Prince of Spain was quarterly Castille, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre. The heraldic achievement also included the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Cross of Burgundy and the yoke and bundle of arrows formerly used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; This would be the same arms he would use as King. Upon Felipe VI's ascension to the throne in 2014, the cross, yoke, and arrows would not be retained in the royal arms.

==Blazon==
The [[blazon]]ing of the coat of arms of the King of Spain is set out in Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.&lt;ref name="BOE527"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/06/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-6525.pdf |title=Real Decreto 527/2014, de 20 de junio, por el que se crea el Guión y el Estandarte de Su Majestad el Rey Felipe VI y se modifica el Reglamento de Banderas y Estandartes, Guiones, Insignias y Distintivos, aprobado por Real Decreto 1511/1977, de 21 de enero. |date=20 June 2014 |website= BOE Spanish Official Journal|series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Royal Decree 527/2014 setting up the Guidon and Standard of HM King Felipe VI and amends Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation, adopted on Royal Decree 1511/1977|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms was adopted when King [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]] was enthroned as King of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2014/06/19/felipe_cuenta_con_escudo_guion_propios_294797_305.html |title=Felipe VI ya cuenta con escudo y guión propios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felipe VI has his own coat of arms and guidon |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=www.heraldo.es |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which is for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which is for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which is for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which is for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Argent enté en point, with a pomegranate proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves vert, which is for [[Granada]].

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which is for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

All surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by eight diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the royal crown of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/armas-iden-idweb.html Coat of arms of His Majesty the King of Spain].

In 1969, General [[Francisco Franco]] appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] as his "successor to the Headship of the Spanish state with the title of King" but gave him the new title of [[Prince of Spain]] instead of the traditional title of [[Prince of Asturias]]. From 1971 to 1975, Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain used a coat of arms which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. Earlier coat of arms differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince of Spain, the King's royal crown has eight half-arches of which five are visible, while the Prince's one has only four half-arches of which three are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_historia/03_bandera_armada--14_miscelania--02_insignias_jefes_estado--05_juan_carlos_i_es ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971''].

Since June 2014, Juan Carlos's son, Felipe VI, has been using the same arms but without the cross of Burgundy, yoke and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/rey/Paginas/rey_armas.aspx |title=Coat of arms of His Majesty King Juan Carlos |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Juan Carlos's arms include a red lion instead of the purple one displayed on the current version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/ReyFelipe/Paginas/principe_armas.aspx |language= |title= Coat of arms of His Majesty the King|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">'''Domentzia''' was a name shared by the mother of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Phocas]] (r. 602–610), and a daughter of the same emperor, likely named after her paternal grandmother.&lt;ref name=PLRE409&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The mother is only named by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], who renders her name in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "Dysmenziane" (Δυσμενζιανή). All other occurrences of the name refer to the daughter. The more familiar form "Domentzia" (Δομεντζία) is given by [[Theophanes the Confessor]]. [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]], who translated the work of Theophanes to [[Latin]], renders the name "Domnentzia". The later historian [[Joannes Zonaras]] gives the name as "Domnentia" (Δομνεντία), while [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]] gives her name as "Dysmenziane", indicating that both women used the same name.&lt;ref name=PLRE409/&gt;

== Mother of Phocas ==

Phocas and his family were likely of [[Thraco-Roman]] origin.&lt;ref name=Bury197&gt;Bury (2009), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The husband of the elder Domentzia is unknown.She had three known sons: Phocas, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]]&lt;ref name=PLRE326&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domentziolus (brother of Phocas)|Domentziolus]]. The latter seems to have been ''[[magister officiorum]]'' by 610.&lt;ref name=Bury201&gt;Bury (2009), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; A grandson, also named [[Domentziolus (nephew of Phocas)|Domentziolus]], was granted the title of ''[[curopalates]]'' on the ascension of Phocas to the throne in 602.&lt;ref name=Bury199&gt;Bury (2009), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Daughter of Phocas ==

The younger Domentzia was a daughter of Phocas and [[Leontia]]. In 607, she married the general [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]], who served as ''[[comes excubitorum]]'', commander of the [[Excubitors]] bodyguard.&lt;ref name=PLRE409/&gt; As she was the only known child of the Emperor, the marriage effectively made Priscus an [[heir apparent]] to the throne. Her husband fell into disfavour however when the citizenry of [[Constantinople]] began erecting statues in their honour.&lt;ref name=PLRE1056&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 1056&lt;/ref&gt;

Her marriage took place in the palace of Marina, named after its original owner, a daughter of [[Arcadius]] and [[Aelia Eudoxia]]. A [[chariot racing]] event was arranged to be held in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], in honor of the newlyweds. The leaders of the Blues (''Vénetoi'') and the Greens (''Prásinoi'') racing factions (''demoi'') decided to honor the occasion by erecting statues of the royal family. Thus they placed images of Phocas, Leontia, Domentzia, and Priscus in the Hippodrome. The images of the reigning imperial couple belonged there by tradition, but the latter two implied that Priscus was the heir or co-emperor of Phocas. Phocas was enraged at the implication and ordered the depictions of his daughter and son-in-law to be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Bury202&gt;Bury (2009), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Phocas further treated the matter as an attempted [[coup d'état]], demanding further investigation of the matter, arresting the demarchs responsible with accusations of [[treason]]. While their lives may have been spared due to popular demand, Phocas likely viewed Priscus himself as the culprit, and seems to have started viewing his son-in-law as a potential rival.&lt;ref name=Bury202/&gt; By alienating Priscus however, Phocas undermined his own hold on the throne. By 608, John of Antioch reports Priscus initiating contact with [[Heraclius the Elder]], the [[Exarchate of Africa|Exarch of Africa]], and instigating the revolt that would eventually remove Phocas from power.&lt;ref name=Bury202-203&gt;Bury (2009), pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eight Witnesses''' were one of the two groups of witnesses who made a statement stating that they had seen the [[golden plates]] which [[Joseph Smith]], Jr. said was his source material for the [[Book of Mormon]]. The other group of [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] who said they saw the plates are called the [[Three Witnesses]].

==Testimony==
The testimony of the Eight Witnesses was first published at the end of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon and has been printed in nearly every edition since, although most subsequent editions moved the statement to the front of the book and included minor grammatical corrections.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shewn unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified that they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;According to Terryl Givens, Joseph invited the Eight "to a family prayer spot in the woods" and "matter-of-factly displayed to them the golden plates," whereas the Three were shown the plates "by an angel of God [who] came down from heaven." [[Terryl Givens]], ''By the Hand of Mormon'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

Toward the end of June 1829, at the [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] home in [[Fayette, New York]], Joseph Smith, Jr. (with [[Oliver Cowdery]] as scribe) finished the translation of the Book of Mormon. Near the end of translation process, a prophecy was translated from the [[Second Book of Nephi]] that three, and "a few" others, might see the golden plates. Subsequently, on June 28, 1829, near the Whitmer farm,&lt;ref name=Anderson2012&gt;{{citation |first= Gale Yancey |last= Anderson |date=Spring 2012 |title= Eleven Witnesses Behold the Plates |journal= [[Journal of Mormon History]] |volume= 38 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} the Three Witnesses had their experience. Thereafter, the Smith and Whitmer families traveled to the [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]]. On July 2, 1829, near the Smith home, the Eight Witnesses saw and handled the golden plates.&lt;ref name=Anderson2012 /&gt;{{rp|156}}

==About the witnesses==

The Eight Witnesses were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]]. Joseph Smith, Sr. was Joseph Smith's father, and Hyrum and Samuel were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were [[David Whitmer]]'s brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005) p. 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive .... The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the familiar relationship among the witnesses, satirist [[Mark Twain]] wrote, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=y589pE4d9FcC&amp;pg=PA113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split with Smith===
In 1838, the living members of Whitmer family (Christian Whitmer and Peter Whitmer, Jr. died in 1835 and 1836, respectively) became estranged from Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated along with other dissenters and fled Caldwell County after receiving an ultimatum from the [[Danites]].&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337, 339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached [[Salt sermon|a vitriolic sermon]] based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot .... Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably Danites by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders .... Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Smith, none of the Whitmers joined the group that was led by [[Brigham Young]] and would become [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Yet despite the estrangement of the Whitmer family, there is little evidence that any of the Eight Witnesses denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the gold plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Givens |first=Terryl |title=The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=99}}; {{Citation |last=Remini |first=Robert |title=Joseph Smith |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Group |pages=67–68}}. One third-hand source, the former Mormon leader Stephen Burnett, said in 1838 that [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] had told him that "the eight witnesses never saw [the plates] &amp; hesitated to sign that instrument for that reason, but were persuaded to do it." Stephen Burnett letter to Lyman E. Johnson dated April 15, 1838. Typed transcript from Joseph Smith Papers, Letter book, April 20, 1837 – February 9, 1843, microfilm reel 2, pp. 64–66, LDS Church archives&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Ashmall''' (9 January 1695 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1798) was an English [[centenarian]] and [[Catholic priest]] for the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]].&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/OldestCentYear.HTM | title=Oldest Validated Centenarian By Year |publisher=[[Gerontology Research Group]] |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He is not to be confused with his uncle, for whom he is named after. It is known that his uncle's name was not used as a [[necronym]] in this case, as his uncle died in 1712, when Ashmall was 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on January 9, 1695 in [[Elwick, County Durham]] to Thomas Ashmall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Historical account of Lisbon college|last = Croft|first = William|publisher = ST.

He returned to England in 1723 where he became the chaplain to Mary Salvin at [[Elvet, County Durham]] until her death in 1727. He then moved back to his family estate in Amerston. He later moved to [[New House, County Durham]] where he remained as the priest until his death.&lt;ref name=demo&gt;{{cite web | author=Julia Hynes |url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/Papers/Books/Monograph2/the%20oldest.htm | title=The Oldest Old in Pre-Industrial Britain: Centenarians Before 1800? |publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] | accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Flag of the President of Azerbaijan was confirmed by the decree №828 of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] on “The Standard (flag) of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan” dated September 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|title=President of Azerbaijan signs Decree on Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree came into force on the same day of its issuance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|title=Decree on the Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=e-qanun.az|archive-url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|title=Standard of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Presidential Library|archive-url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[File:Inauguration Ceremony 2013.jpg|thumb|Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan with Flag of Azerbaijan (left) and Presidential Flag (right)]]
According to the Decree, the Standard of the President of Azerbaijan is the official symbol of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]. The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the Presidential Palace. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed, hung or raised on the buildings of Presidential Palace and Presidential residences; also can be placed in the halls or rooms of Presidential Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President; on other premises when the President of Azerbaijan is visiting; in the halls or on the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]; and on the vehicles of the President.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Presidential flag is also used during inaugural ceremony. It is brought onto the stage by the soldiers of the Armed Forces under the accompaniment of the ceremonial march during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|title=Official inauguration of Ilham Aliyev 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=en.president.az|language=en|archive-url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|title=Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan (2008)|last=|first=|date=|work=AZERBAIJAN STATE NEWS AGENCY|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The Presidential Flag is like a square version of the tricolor [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani flag]] with the [[National emblem of Azerbaijan|Coat of Arm of Azerbaijan]] on both sides of red stripe instead of white crescent and eight-pointed star. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is silver cord attached to the pole of the Presidential Flag illustrating the full name of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] and the date of his term of office. The pole of the flag is covered with a metal hood in crescent and 8 point star shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''George A. Best''' was an English [[association footballer|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He played professionally for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the early 20th century, either side of spells with his hometown club, [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]].

Best made his debut for Blackpool just over halfway through the [[1925–26 Blackpool F.C. season|1925–26]] season, as deputy for [[Len Crompton]], in a 5–2 defeat at Derby County. He appeared in the two successive games — a 3–0 home victory over Bradford City and a 5–0 reversal at Port Vale — before Crompton returned to the line-up.

The following [[1926–27 Blackpool F.C. season|1926–27]] campaign saw Best make 24 [[Football League|League]] appearances. He played his final game for the club on 18 April, in a 2–2 draw at South Shields.

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

[[File:Banner of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Banner of the Republic on display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 83-7115-055-5|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members.

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The young Prince Keawe died shortly after his birth. His death left Kamehameha III again childless. His younger brother, Keaweaweʻulaokalani II, would not be born until 1842.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani II''' (1842–1842) was the second son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was the namesake of his father and his brother.

Initially given in ''[[hānai]]'' to [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], he was instead adopted or ''hānai'' by his grand aunt, [[Kekāuluohi]] and her husband [[Charles Kanaina|Kana{{okina}}ina]] when the old governess of Maui died not three days after his birth. The King promised that he would be sent to the [[Chiefs' Children's School]] once he was weaned and could walk. He soon developed a fever and died, at the age of only 31 days. Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina was convinced that the child was killed by traditional medicinal treatment.

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later monarchs see [[List of Pictish kings|List of Pictish Kings]]. Fib became a puppet state after the reign of the only true king Fib, it was a sub-kingdom from the 7th century BCE until the 9th Century CE (691 BCE - 837/843 CE) when Pictland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin, the last king to rule Pictland before Kenneth was Drest X thus making him the last king of the Fib puppet-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours. 

Most of the entries are derived from ''The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Piazza: Notable private residents in the Piazza | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36/pp96-97 | access-date = 10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based on Sheppard's ''Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Survey of London: Volume 36, Covent Garden | website = British History Online | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, University of London | date = | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol36 | access-date = 18 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources are noted where appropriate.

The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

==Katherine of Aragon==
{{Main article|Katherine of Aragon}}
[[File:Catherine aragon.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Katherine of Aragon]]
[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

==Anne Boleyn==
{{Main article|Anne Boleyn}}
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]
[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

==Jane Seymour==
{{Main article|Jane Seymour}}
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 1536{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 1540{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.

==Catherine Howard==
{{Main article|Catherine Howard}}
[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]
[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 1540{{spaced ndash}}23 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

Marriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 1543{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinister supporter came from the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|coat of arms of her father]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who displayed his shield on the breast of a single-headed Apostolic eagle displayed. Catherine's badges were a commemoration of the [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] from the [[Emirate of Granada|Moors]], where a victory was gained by the superiority of the Spanish archers. Both badges were combined with the [[Tudor rose]] (Henry's dynastic symbol).&lt;ref name="Pinces 142"&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented that the: "Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts "Augmentations" to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of [[Heraldry]] under the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor Sovereign]]."&lt;ref name="Boutell 242"/&gt; The dexter supporter was intended to represent the leopard of [[Guyenne]] (Aquitaine). The sinister supporter was a [[Charge_(heraldry)#Animals|heraldic creature]] from the badge of the Boleyn, as descended from Earls of Ormond (Butler).&lt;ref name="Willment 69"&gt;Willement p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon badge was granted to Anne as Countess of Pembroke, this badge was also used by her daughter Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

An alternative set of supporters for Queen Jane was reportedly: "Dexter a unicorn argent, crowned and unguled or, collared with a double wreath of white daisies and red roses; Sinister, a panther incensed, striped with various colours, gorged with a coronet of crosses patée and fleurs de lys alternately and chained or."&lt;ref name="Pinces 146"/&gt; The badge of the phoenix rising from the flames was granted posthumously by her son King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] to his maternal relations (who became the Dukes of Somerset), who continues to use it as a crest in their coat of arms to this day.&lt;ref name="Willment 71"&gt;Willement p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox Davies 597"&gt;Fox Davies p. 597&lt;/ref&gt;

-----
The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh. Her badge was granted by the King, it combined the Tudor rose badge of Henry with a previous one used by the Queen's family. The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''née'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. She lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in Cornwall in 1771 to John (1736-1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d.1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and  Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.&lt;ref name="Priaulx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792-1903)
* John (1793-1865) - married Anne Sophia Grut (1802-1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796-) - never married.
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants.
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States.
* Augusta (1804) - married.
* Louisa (1805-1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in [[Guernsey]]. Early in her life she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve, as she would become, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to Prussian Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".&lt;ref name="neve1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1903-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=NY Times |date=19 April 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.&lt;ref name="ST03"&gt;{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |publisher=The Straits Times |date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.&lt;ref name="neve2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1900-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;RG10-5765-222-1&lt;/ref&gt; Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth.  Their last trip was in 1872, when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref name="neve2" /&gt;

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1899-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her age, Margaret was found making [[marmalade]] the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105, when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.&lt;ref name="BIB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] congratulating her for reaching her 110th birthday. However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.

It is a [[hermeneutics]] of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different [[cultural memory|memory cultures]], proposing an essential instability of historical lives.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Steven Shapin]], metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven, 2006. “Lives after death,” ''Nature'', vol. 441: 286.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.

== Metabiography vs. traditional biography ==
As part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years,&lt;ref&gt;Söderqvist, Thomas, 2007. Untitled review of Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography'', ''Isis'', vol. 98: 203-204; Söderqvist however defines metabiography as the critical appraisal of biographical literature about a particular person in the traditional way.&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Henry Guerlac]]’s study of “[[Lavoisier]] and his biographers”&lt;ref&gt;Guerlac, Henry, 1954. “Lavoisier and his biographers,” ''Isis'', vol. 45: 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] biographies&lt;ref&gt;Hall, A. Rupert, 1999. ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth-Century Perspectives''. Oxford [etc.]: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.

== Examples of metabiography in general history ==
In the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, David B., 1996. ''Beethoven in German Politics, 1870-1989''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Lucasta Miller]] who used it to good effect in the case [[Emily Brontë]] (1818–48).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lucasta, 2001. ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Cape&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Gordon S. Wood]]’s study on the Americanization of [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., 2004. ''The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin''. New York, NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.

== Examples of metabiography in the field of scientific biography ==
Examples of scientific metabiography are [[Jan Sapp]]’s “The nine lives of [[Gregor Mendel]],”&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan, 1990. “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel” in Le Grand, Homer E. (ed.), ''Experimental Inquiries''. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp. 137-166. Sapp analyses the different interpretations of Mendel’s work in genetics by later practitioners in the field, who variously described him as a Darwinian, a non-Darwinian, an evolutionist, an opponent of evolutionary theory, a Mendelian geneticist, not a Mendelian geneticist, a man who did or did not falsify his data or even as someone who completely fabricated his experiments on plant hybrids.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Fara’s ''Newton: the Making of Genius''&lt;ref&gt;Fara, Patricia, 2002. ''Newton: the Making of Genius''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|Nicolaas Rupke]]’s ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography''.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press; Rupke shows how from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day Humboldt has served as a nucleus of crystallisation for a variety of successive socio-political ideologies in Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James, 1994. ''The Darwin Legend''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Books; Moore, James, 1999. “Telling tales: Evangelicals and the Darwin legend” in Livingstone, David N., Hart, D.G., and Noll, Mark A. (eds), ''Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 220-233; Colp, Ralph, 1989. “Charles Darwin’s past and future biographies,” ''History of Science'', vol. 27: 167-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the ''Reader’s Guide to the History of Science'' (2000).

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]
In several cultures, a '''middle name''' is a portion of a [[personal name]] that is written between the person's [[given name]] and their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a "middle name", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): 
* part of a two-word given name (e.g. ''[[Mary Anne]]'', about [[Mary Anne Clarke]], and "[[Joe Bob Briggs]]"), 
* a [[maiden name]] (e.g. [[Hillary Clinton|Rodham]]), 
* a [[patronymic]] (e.g. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Sergeyevich]]), 
* a [[baptismal name]] (e.g. "Christopher" invoking [[Saint Christopher]]), or
* a maternal [[surname]] (such as in Portuguese and Brazilian names).
 
In the [[United States]], such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, [[patronymic]]s, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the "middle name" is often [[abbreviated]] to the '''middle initial''' (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for [[signature]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688–1766).

Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical ''[[Harvardiana]]''.

The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} by the increased use of [[software|computer]] [[database]]s that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such [[databases]] under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like [[María del Pilar Pereyra]] or [[María de las Nieves García]].

The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.

Since 1905, "middle name" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."

==English==
In countries that primarily speak English—such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage.&lt;ref name=genfiles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genfiles.com/articles/middle-names/ | title=The Use of Middle Names| date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.&lt;ref name=genfiles/&gt;

In the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an [[initial]], e.g. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was [[Harry S. Truman]]. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | title=Truman: The "S" Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the "upper classes" and "middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nameberry.com/blog/british-baby-names-two-middle-names | title=British Baby Names: Two middle names| date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[George H. W. Bush]].

Middle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are [[Paul McCartney]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Hayley Orrantia]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Meghan Markle]], [[Rihanna]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Roger Waters]] and [[Jim Acosta]].

=== Chinese ===
{{Further|Chinese name|Generation name|Courtesy name|Art name}}
Traditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (''ming''), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage.  Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family.  For example, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] has the given name ''Yinzhen'' (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character "Yin" (胤).  His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character ''Hong'' (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors.  In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the [[One-child_policy|One-child Policy]], there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

A fading Chinese tradition is to use a [[courtesy name]], called ''zì'' (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood.  Traditionally ''zì'' is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old.  This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect.  Like the ''ming'', the ''zì'' is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the ''ming''.  Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their ''zì''.  An alternative courtesy name is the ''hào'' ({{zh|s=号|t=號|p=hào|labels=no}}; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A ''hào'' was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's ''míng'' or ''zì''; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the ''hào'' to refer to themselves. The ''zì'' or ''hào'' can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.

Some [[Chinese American]]s move their Chinese given name ([[Romanization of Chinese|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]]) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. [[James Soong|James Chu-yu Soong]], [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang]], and [[Michelle Kwan|Michelle Wingshan Kwan]]. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] names, such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.

The practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.

In the example [[Carl Viggo Manthey Lange]], the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used [[patronymic]]s until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.

In [[Sweden]], the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called "tilläggsnamn" (additional name), and are called "mellannamn" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.

Furthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish ("mellannamn") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'')), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]] has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.

In Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'').

==Southeast Asia==

===Vietnam===

{{Further|Vietnamese name}}

Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are "Văn" for male names and "Thị" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially "Thị". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names ([[unisex name]]s are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

===Philippines===
{{further information|Filipino name}}

For Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used [[Spanish naming customs]], that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle ''y'' (or ''e'', before "i"), which remains in use but became restricted to  very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name ''Juan Santos Macaraig'', with ''Santos'' the middle name in the present order, may become ''Juan S. Macaraig'' with the middle name abbreviated, and ''Juan Macaraig y Santos'' in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official [[mug shot]]s. The Philippine system, using "given name-middle name-surname" order (or "Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname") coincidentally follows the [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.

But, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in ''[[Jose P.  Laurel]]'', where "P." (a middle initial)  corresponds to ''Paciano''.

In illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. 

To illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named ''Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala'' and ''Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada'', named '"Maria Cristina'", will be named ''Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz''), with Ana Cristina's middle name,  ''dela Cruz'', as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname ''Lozada'', but keep the maternal surmame ''Manansala'' as middle name, thus, ''Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. Lozada''). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called ''Maria Cristina Lozada'' or ''Ma. Cristina Lozada'', even when the mother is known.

In married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco''), once marrying ''Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan'' (or ''Juan Pablo S. Marasigan'') may take the name ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P.  Limchauco-Marasigan''), maintaining the maternal surname ''Perez'', ''Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan''), taking the maiden surname ''Limchauco'' as middle name and ''Marasigan'' as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' upon marriage.

== Latin America ==
In Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed "segundo nombre" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/segundo-nombre-pasa-moda-usa-poner-solo_0_ryME5BGvb.html | title=El segundo nombre pasa de moda: Se usa poner sólo uno}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Actually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).

==History==
[[General Francisco del Castillo]], a close associate of [[Andres Bonifacio]]. This Aklanon Katipunero was tasked by Bonifacio to establish [[Katipunan]] in [[Panay Island]]. On March 17, 1897, the young patriot, defender of liberty and leader of the Aklan revolutionists was killed by an assassin during a fight in the present-day Pastrana Park. The untimely death of Gen. del Castillo had signaled the end of the major struggle for freedom in Aklan. His close friends, assistants and soldiers were forced to give up arms, some due to the promise of receiving amnesty. These Nineteen Men, weak from hunger and thirst and racked with rain, were bound together and forced into a black hole of a stone cell on Amadeo Street (now Nineteen Martyrs Street) in [[Kalibo]]. Here their hands were manacled and a long bamboo pole was passed through their locked arms across their mangled backs. Then they were strung high up against the wall of the cell, with their backs to the firing line, and during the first hours of March 23, they were shot to death. The few who did not die instantly were bayoneted. That was a night of darkness and terror in [[Kalibo]].
But such promise was quickly broken. So on the fateful day of March 23, 1897, the Martyrs of Aklan were executed.

On March 23, 1897, all 19 prisoners were summarily executed by a firing squad in the town square. Their bodies were hastily buried in a mass grave inside a cemetery. By virtue of a Municipal Council resolution, the mortal remains of 19 martyrs were transferred to its present site at corner M. Laserna and Veterans’ Avenue on March 23, 1926.
In order to commemorate the death anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan, Republic Act No. 7806 was made into law setting the 23rd day of March of every year as a special public holiday in the Province of Aklan. A former general himself, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] let Republic Act 7806 lapsed into law without his signature. And on September 1, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 27(1) of the Constitution became law.

On the 102th martyrdom anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan on March 23, 2018, the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] officially turned over to the Provincial Government of Aklan a tableau memorial in honor of the freedom heroes at the Goding Ramos Park.

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*[[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines 1214]]
*[[Seventh Crusade|Seventh Crusade 1248]]
*[[Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle|Mons-en-Pévèle 1304]]

*[[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers 1356]]
*[[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke 1382]]
*[[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt 1415]]

The Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle,&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, Kelly (2006) : ''Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century''. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Crécy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trial by Battle |last=Sumption |first= Jonathon|year=1990|publisher= Faber &amp; Faber|location=London |isbn=0-571-20095-8 |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poitiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Green | title=The Battle of Poitiers 1356 | publisher= | location= | year=2004 | isbn=0-7524-2557-9|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Agincourt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Agincourt|last=Barker |first=Juliet |authorlink=Juliet Barker |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0316726486 |page=288 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also during the campaigns of the [[Seventh Crusade]] under [[King Louis IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5ry8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=oriflamme+lost+at+crecy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pI5Vxrq898&amp;sig=c1k1MERjD9ECAMD1WfoIvaA_Rb4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMI493i9t6MxwIVAuFyCh1J-gGR#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20lost%20at%20crecy&amp;f=false Edward Cowan (2012) '' The Wallace Book'', Birlinn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-02/moa-15a.html|title= The Oriflamme|date=2000|publisher=The Baronage Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Notable Bearers of the ''Oriflamme'' ===

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&amp;newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s posthumous name was Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕), while his temple name was Gwangjong. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 113 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

The '''Presidential Standard of Pakistan''' is the official flag of the [[President of Pakistan]].

== Design ==

The Presidential Standard consists of the background of the [[Flag of Pakistan]] with the gold Presidential Crest replacing the white crescent and star found in the Flag of Pakistan. The Presidential Crest consists of a smaller crescent and star flanked by wheat branches with the words "Pakistan" written in Urdu underneath.

== Use ==

The Presidential Standard is displayed only in the presence of the President of Pakistan, particularly in the office and official residence of the President of Pakistan. It is always displayed alongside the Flag of Pakistan. It is also flown alongside the Flag of Pakistan in the Presidential motorcade. The Presidential Standard is never flown atop any building.

== History ==

The Presidential Standard was first adopted in 1956 and has since been redesigned twice: in 1974 and 1998.

[[File:Slottet i Oslo januar 15.JPG|thumb|The Royal Standard flying over the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] in Oslo]]

The '''[[Royal Standard (disambiguation)|Royal Standard]] of Norway''' ({{lang-no| Kongeflagget}}) is used by the [[King of Norway]]. Of historical origin, it was introduced by Cabinet Decision of 15 November 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/1905-11-15-2 Resolution on the King's Flag (15.11.1905) – Lovdata]&lt;/ref&gt; following the plebiscite confirming the election of [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl]] of [[Denmark]] to the vacant throne after the dissolution of the [[union between Sweden and Norway]]. Under his chosen name of [[Haakon VII]], the new king arrived in the capital [[Kristiania]] on 25 November 1905 on a ship flying the royal standard for the first time. 

The flag of the King is also used by the Queen.

==Background and history==
[[File:Nordisk konge til hest i Ernst von Kirchbergs Mecklenburgske Rimkrønike.png|thumb|left|150px|A depiction originally from ca. 1370 of a Nordic king holding the flags of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.]]
[[File:Norge 1380.tif|thumb|left|150px|Likely appearance of medieval flag of Norway.]]
The flag was referred to as the "ancient royal standard" of Norway when it was re-introduced in 1905. It is the earliest known flag of Norway, originally only a flag for the king, as it is today. During the early period of the union with [[Denmark]], it was occasionally flown from castles and naval vessels until it was gradually phased out during the 17th and 18th centuries. Its earliest certain depiction is on the seal of [[Ingeborg of Norway#Regency|Duchess Ingebjørg]] in 1318. In 1748 a decree stated that the [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] should be the only legal merchant flag for ships of the united kingdoms of [[Denmark-Norway]].

===Union between Sweden and Norway (1814–1905)===
{{further information|Union between Sweden and Norway}} 

From 1814 to 1905, Norway entered a [[personal union]] with Sweden. As a result, the two nations would share the same monarch (and a common foreign policy) but remain separate kingdoms with their own laws and legislative bodies. In 1844, new flags with common features reflecting the union were introduced for the two kingdoms.

From 1844 until 1905, the kings of Norway (i.e. also the King of Sweden) used a royal standard on the same pattern as [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. It was Norway's [[war flag]] with the [[Union mark of Norway and Sweden|union mark]] in the [[canton (flag)|canton]] and the addition of the royal union arms in the centre of the cross. In Norway, growing discontent with the union would lead to the union mark being removed from the merchant (i.e. today's national flag) and the state flag, but the mark remained in the war flag (naval ensign) and the royal flag as they were under jurisdiction of the king.

The flag introduced in 1844 would be made redundant after the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|dissolution of the union with Sweden]] in 1905 and the adoption of the current flag.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

File:Royal Standard of Norway (1844-1905).svg|Royal Standard of Norway 1844-1905
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Description==
The flag is the [[coat of arms of Norway]] in [[Banner of arms|banner form]] and features a golden lion over a red field. With the dissolution of the Union in 1905 and election of a new king, the Norwegian Lion coat of arms were subsequently adopted for use by the King as was the old royal flag.

Graphically, that first royal standard was charged with a lion designed by the Danish expert on [[heraldry]] ''Anders Thiset'', complying with the [[blazon]] decided by the Cabinet. It differed from the definitive version of the royal standard, which was charged with the lion designed by the painter [[Eilif Peterssen]]&lt;ref&gt;Website of the Royal House of Norway, http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=74742&amp;sek=26980&lt;/ref&gt; The Peterssen designed lion was changed on the coat of arms for government use in 1937 to fit a [[medieval]] style, but the king kept the 1905 Peterssen design for the royal arms and standard.

==The Standard of the Crown Prince==
[[File:Kronprinsflagg.svg|thumb|The standard of the crown prince]]

The flag of the Crown Prince (''Kronprinsflagget'') is similar to the royal standard, except that the field is swallowtailed. It was introduced by Royal Resolution of 26 September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/1924-09-26-4 Resolution regarding the flag of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (26.09.1924) – Lovdata]&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown Prince's flag may also be used by the Crown Princess.

There are no flags for the rest of the royal family.

Tobias's father John was transferred by the army to New Zealand and Henry's father John moved to Wales.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== ''Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'' ==
''Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'' is a study of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]], their religious rites and their relationship with Muslims.The author analyses Muslim-Christian relations in Egypt prior to the 1919 Revolution for independence from the British and believes the British occupation has ruined the relationship between Muslims and Copts in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Al-Musawar]]'' Magazine, 23 May 2008 in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 21, art. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was written after the author lived in Egypt and visited several Coptic families in the Delta and [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]]. The work was published in English in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;An electronic copy of the book is available through http://scholarship.rice.edu/jsp/xml/1911/9178/857/LeeMode.tei-timea.html&lt;/ref&gt; translated into Arabic by Ahmad Mahmūd and published in 2008 by Dar al-Shuruq in Egypt.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

A '''slave name''' is the [[personal name]] given by others to an [[slavery|enslaved]] person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. The modern use of the term applies mostly to [[African Americans]] and [[Afro-Caribbean|West Indians]] who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers.

Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an [[Africanization|African identity]] became common after [[emancipation]] in the 1960s by those in the [[African diaspora in the Americas]] seeking a reconnection to their African cultural roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ancient Rome==
{{Slavery}}
In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was [[manumission|freed]] might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]. As an example, one historian says that "a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Harold Whetstone Johnston]] writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the [[freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html#60 Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Americans==

A number of African-Americans and [[Afro-Caribbeans]] have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion ([[Muhammad Ali]] changed his name from Cassius Clay, [[Malcolm X]] from Malcolm Little, and [[Louis Farrakhan]] changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Farrakhan Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-farrakhan-9291850|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or involvement with the [[black nationalist]] movement (e.g., [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Assata Shakur]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Van Deburg|Deburg, William L. Van]], "Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan",  NYU Press (1997), p 269, {{ISBN|0-8147-8789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations encourage African-Americans to abandon their slave names. The [[Nation of Islam]] is perhaps the best-known of them. In his book, ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Nation of Islam leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] writes often of slave names. Some of his comments include:

* "''You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man's name.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk24.htm [[Muhammad, Elijah]]; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 24; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''You are still called by your slave-masters' names. By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America. He knows that. You have never gotten out of the shackles of slavery. You are still in them.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk34.htm Muhammad, Elijah; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 34; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[US Organization]] also advocates for African-Americans to change their slave names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-organization.org/nguzosaba/NguzoSaba.html "NGUZO SABA (The Seven Principles)" From : US Organization website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Texas Aces''' is a name colloquially given to five [[Miss Texas USA]] titleholders who went on to win the [[Miss USA]] beauty pageant in succession from 1985-1989.

Prior to the 1980s, no other state had won more than two [[Miss USA]] pageants in succession (the only two states to win twice in succession were [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]] in 1969-1970 and [[Miss Illinois USA|Illinois]] from 1973-1974).  The five Texan Miss USA winners were all coached by "GuyRex", Richard Guy and Rex Holt, who held the Texas franchise from 1975.  The term was first used in 1988 after Gibbs became their fourth consecutive titleholder, with Guy referring to the four queens as "four aces in a deck of cards", with their fifth titleholder, Kim Tomes (1977) as the "wildcard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss USA Contest Rewards Winners, Gurus|publisher=Associated Press|date=1988-03-02|first=Holden|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Gretchen Polhemus became the fifth and final "ace".  The term is still in use.

As well as directing the Texas pageant, GuyRex also acquired the [[Miss California USA]] franchise in 1986.  In 1988, Diana Magaña of California placed first runner-up to Gibbs, the fourth ace.  The two had both undergone extensive preparation by GuyRex, and even lived together prior to the pageant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-08-31|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Up Beauty / In the months before the Miss USA Pageant, advisers work on Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-10-01|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five Aces were:
*1985 - [[Laura Harring|Laura Martinez-Herring]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1985)
*1986 - [[Christy Fichtner]] ('''Miss USA''', 1st runner-up at Miss Universe 1986)
*1987 - [[Michelle Royer]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1987)
*1988 - [[Courtney Gibbs]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1988)
*1989 - [[Gretchen Polhemus]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1989)

[[File:Trauco.jpg|thumb|Artist's representation of the Trauco]]

In the traditional [[Chilota mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], the '''Trauco''' is a humanoid creature of small stature - similar to a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] or [[goblin]] - who lives in the deep forests. It has an ugly face, and legs without feet.

== Legend ==
The '''Trauco''' is a mythical entity who inhabits the woods of [[Chiloé]], an island in the south of [[Chile]]. It has a powerful magnetism that attracts young and middle-aged women. According to myth, the Trauco's wife is the wicked and ugly '''Fiura'''. The trauco carries a small stone-headed hatchet that he uses to strike trees in the forest to symbolize his sexual potency.

Whomever the Trauco chooses will go to him, even if she is sleeping, and fall enraptured at his feet. No woman can resist his magical attraction; all have sexual intercourse with him. Some men of Chiloé fear the Trauco, as his gaze can be deadly.

When a single woman is pregnant and no one steps forward as the father, people assume that the Trauco is the father. Because the Trauco is irresistible, the woman is considered blameless. The Trauco is sometimes invoked to explain sudden or unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women.

== Media ==

The Trauco appears in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]] where he functions as an antagonist in some of the subplots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">'''Xenagoras''' ({{lang-grc|Ξεναγόρας}}) was the name of a number of men of [[classical antiquity]]:

*[[Xenagoras of Halicarnassus]], companion of the Achaemenid commander [[Masistes]]
*[[Xenagoras (historian)]], a historical writer, likely of the 2nd century BCE
*Xenagoras, historian, and father of the historian [[Nymphis]]. Possibly the same man as the above. If so, he must have lived in the early part of the second century BCE.
*[[Xenagoras (geometer)]], who wrote in the ancient world about the heights of mountains
*Xenagoras, an [[archon]] of [[Delphi]] in late 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
