'''Abstract object theory''' is a branch of [[metaphysics]] regarding [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]]. Originally devised by metaphysicist [[Edward Zalta]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html|title= The Theory of Abstract Objects|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= February 10, 1999|work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory was an expansion of [[mathematical Platonism]].

''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'' (1983) is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N. [https://books.google.com/books?id=voCSP6k3FCcC ''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'']. D. Reidel Publishing Company. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Zalta's account, there are two modes of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]]: some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) "exemplify" properties, while others ([[abstract object]]s like numbers, and what others would call "non-existent objects", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely "encode" them.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for a formalized [[ontology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], '''accidental necessity''', often stated in its [[Latin]] form, ''necessitas per accidens'', refers to the necessity attributed to the past by certain views of time. It is a controversial concept: its supporters argue that it has intuitive validity while others contest it creates a contradiction in terms by positing such a thing as a "contingent necessity." It is especially important in contemporary discussions of logical and theological [[fatalism]].

'''Anna Willess Williams''' (1857 – April 17, 1926) was a teacher and philosophical writer best known as the model for [[George T. Morgan|George T. Morgan's]] silver dollar design, popularly known as the [[Morgan dollar]].

In 1876, George T. Morgan began creating a series of new coin designs at the behest of Director of the Mint, [[Henry Linderman|Dr. Henry R. Linderman]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;Van Allen &amp; Mallis, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan opted to use the profile of an American girl to depict [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] instead of simply creating an imaginary figure for the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of his new design.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; After he rejected several possible candidates, Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], recommended Anna Williams of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; 

Williams reluctantly sat for five modelling sessions with Morgan in November 1876 after being convinced to do so by friends.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; The [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams was troubled by her newly acquired fame, receiving thousands of letters and visits at both her home and workplace.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams preferred not to talk about her modelling work with Morgan, dismissing it as an "incident of my youth."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Bourgeois revolution''' is a term used in [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory to refer to a [[Social revolution|social revolution]] that aims to destroy a [[feudal system]] or its vestiges, establish the rule of the [[bourgeoisie]], and create a bourgeois state.&lt;ref name="ada2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bourgeois+Revolution |title=Bourgeois Revolution |website=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonised or subjugated countries, bourgeois revolutions often take the form of a war of national [[independence]]. The [[English Revolution#Marxist theory|English]], [[French Revolution|French]], and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions are considered the archetypal bourgeois revolutions, in that they attempted to clear away the remnants of the medieval feudal system, so as to pave the way for the rise of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="ada2" /&gt; The term is usually used in contrast to "[[proletarian revolution]]", and is also sometimes called a "'''bourgeois-democratic revolution'''".

According to one version of the [[two-stage theory]], bourgeois revolution was asserted to be necessary step in the move toward [[socialism]]. In this view, countries that had preserved their feudal structure, like [[Russian Empire|Russia]], would have to establish capitalism via a bourgeois revolution before being able to wage a proletarian revolution. At the time of the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Mensheviks]] asserted this theory, arguing that a revolution led by bourgeoisie was necessary to modernise society, establish basic freedoms, and overcome feudalism, which would establish the conditions necessary for socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: St |website=www.marxists.org |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">In the [[philosophy of language]], the '''context principle''' is a form of [[semantic holism]]{{cn|date=April 2013}} holding that a philosopher should "never ... ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition" (Frege [1884/1980] x). 

==Analysis&lt;!--'Compositionalism' and 'Semantic contextualism' redirect here--&gt;==
The context principle is one of [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "three fundamental principles" for philosophical analysis, first discussed in his Introduction to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (''Grundlagen der Arithmetik'', 1884). Frege argued that many philosophical errors, especially those related to [[psychologism]] in the [[philosophy of logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], could be avoided by adhering carefully to the context principle. The view of meaning expressed by the context principle is sometimes called '''semantic contextualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meanings of words or expressions can (or must) be determined prior to, and independently of, the meanings of the propositions in which they occur, which is often referred to as '''compositionalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The context principle also figures prominently in the work of other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosophers]], such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who were greatly influenced by Frege's work.

== Formulations of the context principle ==
=== Gottlob Frege, Introduction to ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'' (1884/1980) ===

: In the enquiry that follows, I have kept to three fundamental principles:
:: always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective;
:: never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition
:: never to lose sight of the distinction between concept and object.

=== Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' (1921/1922) ===

: '''3.3''' Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning. ...
: '''3.314''' An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a [[propositional variable]].
: (Including the variable name.)

'''''D'Alembert’s Dream''''' ( or '''The Dream of D'Alembert''', {{lang-fr|'''Le Rêve de d'Alembert'''}}) is an ensemble of three philosophical dialogues authored by [[Denis Diderot]] in 1769, which first appeared in Grimm's ''Correspondance Littéraire'' in 1782, but was not published in its own right until 1830:

* Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot
* D’Alembert’s Dream
* Continuation of the Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot

In this work, Diderot is at the zenith of his development of [[materialism|materialist]] theories. It is here that he introduces his theory on life and nature, indicating that matter is not fixed but that, on the contrary, subject to [[evolution]]. Each species in existence transforms itself and gives birth to a new species.

He would later create a special version for his patroness, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, replacing the certain character names.

Both [[Julie de Lespinasse]] and [[D’Alembert]] took poorly to being used as protagonists of the conversations.

'''Daniel N. Robinson''' (March 9, 1937 – September 17, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[http://commentary.jameswilsoninstitute.org/2018/09/remembering-daniel-nicholas-robinson-1937-2018/ Remembering Daniel Nicholas Robinson (1937-2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American philosopher who was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Georgetown University]] and a [[fellow]] of the faculty of philosophy at [[Oxford University]].

== Career ==
Robinson has published in a wide variety of subjects, including [[moral philosophy]], the [[philosophy of psychology]], [[legal philosophy]], the [[philosophy of the mind]], [[intellectual history]], [[legal history]], and the [[history of psychology]]. He has held academic positions at [[Amherst College]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Columbia University]]. In addition, he served as the principal consultant to [[PBS]] and the [[BBC]] for their award-winning series "The Brain" and "The Mind", and he lectured for [[The Great Courses]]' series on Philosophy. He is on the Board of Consulting Scholars of Princeton University's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jmp.princeton.edu/about/people/james-madison-society|title=James Madison Society {{!}} James Madison Program|website=jmp.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Senior Fellow of [[BYU]]'s Wheatley Institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wheatley.byu.edu/the-wheatley-institution-organization/|title=The Wheatley Institution {{!}} Organization|website=wheatley.byu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he received the Gittler Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/apf/funding/gittler.aspx?tab=4|title=APF Joseph B.

"

== Primary interests ==
Robinson’s interests range over the brain sciences, philosophy, law and intellectual history. Several of his works are illustrative of these interests. Regarded as a classic in its field, his ''An Intellectual History of Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=An intellectual history of psychology|date=1995|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=978-0-299-14844-7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was praised by [[Ernest Hilgard]] for its “…development of ideas as they provide alternative perspectives on the nature of mind…The reader is carried along on a genuine intellectual adventure."&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Wisconsin Press|url=http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0136.htm.|accessdate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Robinson’s enduring interest in Aristotle’s thought is summarized in ''Aristotle’s Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Aristotle's psychology|date=1999|publisher=Joe Christensen Inc.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-9672066-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Deborah Modrak described as “Easy to read and informative” predicting that it would “no doubt prompt readers to reflect on the relevance of Aristotle’s work to modern psychology…” (International Studies in Philosophy, Volume 23, Issue 3, 1991; pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143). In this connection, Robinson was among the small group assembled by [[Martin Seligman]] in 1999 to develop the framework for Positive Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/posclinpsychchap.htm|title=Positive Clinical Psychology|date=2014-10-01|access-date=2017-09-02|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001132438/http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/posclinpsychchap.htm|archivedate=2014-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wild Beasts and Idle Humours'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Wild beasts &amp; idle humours : the insanity defense from antiquity to the present|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-95290-4|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson offers a treatise on the relationship between science and jurisprudence as this developed from ancient to contemporary times.  Michael Perlin describes the book as “truly unique. It synthesizes material that I do not believe has ever been considered in this context, and links up the historical past with contemporaneous values and politics. Robinson effortlessly weaves religious history, literary history, medical history, and political history, and demonstrates how the insanity defense cannot be fully understood without consideration of all these sources.”   Robert Kinscherff states that it “…reads like the inner workings of a fascinating and disciplined narrative mind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674952904&amp;content=reviews|title=Wild Beasts and Idle Humours — Daniel N. Robinson {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson’s major work in moral philosophy is ''Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Application''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Praise and blame : moral realism and its application|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=978-0-691-05724-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book in Review of  Metaphysics, Jude P. Dougherty writes, “The richness of this work cannot be comprehended in one reading.  Whether the reader agrees or not with the author, one has much to learn from the profundity of Robinson's insight into the framing of moral judgment”.  (Rev. Metaphys., 2003, vol. 56, 899-900.)

Central to Robinson’s concerns are the conceptual and philosophical foundations of psychology and related subjects.   Of Robinson’s ''Philosophy of Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Philosophy of psychology|date=1985|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-05923-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Dray wrote that “this highly readable book squarely addresses fundamental metaphysical, epistemological and methodological problems…His clear and informed treatment…offers salutary challenge to much conventional wisdom on the nature and prospects of psychological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KJBMlurP9P0C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=daniel+robinson+philosophy+of+psychology+william+dray#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20robinson%20philosophy%20of%20psychology%20william%20dray&amp;f=false|title=Philosophy of Psychology|isbn=978-0-231-05923-7|author1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''Danish philosophy''' has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]].

Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[Søren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]], which inspired the philosophical movement of [[Existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald Hoffding|Harald Høffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]].  Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]].

'''David Doig''' [[FRSE]] LLD (1719–1800) was a Scottish educator, philologist and writer known for historical and philosophical works. He was Rector of Stirling High School from 1760 to 1800. Doig is also believed to have been the inventor of the tartan pattern now associated with [[Burberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=440|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|website=www.tartanregister.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Doig Silhouette.jpg|thumb|David Doig, silhouette]]
[[File:Memorial to David Doig, Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling.jpg|thumb|Memorial to David Doig, [[Church of the Holy Rude]], Stirling]]

==Life==
David was born 14 Feb 1719 at Mill of Melgund, [[Aberlemno]], Angus, son of David Doig and Ann Sturrock. His father, who was a small farmer, died while he was an infant, and his mother married again. He was successful in a Latin competition for a bursary at the [[University of St. Andrews]]. Having finished the classical and philosophical course and proceeded B.A., he began the study of divinity, but scruples regarding the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] prevented him from entering the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]].

Doig taught from 1749 in the parochial schools of Monifieth, [[Kennoway]] and [[Falkland, Fifeshire]]. His reputation then gained for him the rectorship of the grammar school of [[Stirling]], a post he filled for over 40 years. In addition to Greek and Latin Doig had mastered Hebrew and Arabic. The [[University of Glasgow]] conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D., and on the same day he received from St. Andrews his diploma as M.A. He was also elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]].

Robert Burns visited Stirling on 27 Aug 1787 when he had dinner at the Golden Lion Hotel with Lieutenant Forrester of the Castle garrison, Dr David Doig of the Grammar School and Christopher Bell, a singing teacher. He later described Dr. David Doig as "a queerish figure, and something of a pedant." [Note: Robert Burns' school teacher in Maybole, Ayr was also a David Doig (1679/80-1784).]

Doig was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|Dr James Gregory]], [[Andrew Dalzell]], and [[John Playfair]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doig died in [[Stirling]] on 16 March 1800, aged 81. He is buried in the Holy Rude Cemetery next to [[Stirling Castle]].

A mural tablet, with an inscription in commemoration of his virtues and learning, was raised by his friend [[John Ramsay of Ochtertyre]]. The town of Stirling also erected a marble monument to his memory, with a Latin epitaph written by himself.

==Family==

Doig was married to Isabella Janet Bower (1727-1762) in [[Monifieth]] on 17 November 1749.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

They had children: Isabella, Ann, Jean, David, George, and Patrick. Their daughter Isabella (1751-1819) married Dr. John Aird (c.1740-1790) with sons William, David, and John. The next four children died young. Patrick Doig (1762-1833) married Jane Austin (1781-1849)with a son David (1812-1819); Patrick later became a medical doctor in Antigua.

==Works==
Doig's first known appearance in print was some twenty pages of annotation on the ''[[Gaberlunzie-man]]'', in an edition of that and another old Scottish poem, ''[[Christis Kirk on the Green|Christ's Kirk on the Green]]'', published in 1782 by his friend and neighbour [[John Callander]] of Craigforth. ''Two Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kaims'' (London, 1792) attacked the views of [[Lord Kames]] in ''[[Sketches of the History of Man]]'' (1774). The first of the letters, from 1775, had been sent to Kames, who was passing the Christmas vacation a few miles from Stirling, and who invited Doig to dinner next day.

Doig's next publication was ''Extracts from a Poem on the Prospect from Stirling Castle'' (Stirling, 1796). He contributed to vol. iii. of the ''Transactions'' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh a dissertation "On the Ancient Hellenes". He also wrote in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' third edition]] the articles on "Mythology", "Mysteries", and "Philology". They brought Doig correspondence with [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jacob Bryant]].

Besides Latin and English poems Doig left some treatises in manuscript. A partial list  was in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 8th edit. viii. 92.

Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

'''Early modern philosophy''' (also '''classical modern philosophy''')&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Tlumak, ''Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. xi: "[''Classical Modern Philosophy''] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacht"&gt;[[Richard Schacht]], ''Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant'', Routledge, 2013, p. 1: "Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant".&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of philosophy]] at the beginning or overlapping with the period known as [[modern philosophy]].

==Overview==
The [[early modern period]] in history is roughly 1500–1789,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]]. 1982. ''[[All That Is Solid Melts into Air]]: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-24602-X}}. London: Verso. pp. 16–17. {{ISBN|0-86091-785-1}}. Paperback reprint New York: Viking Penguin, 1988. {{ISBN|0-14-010962-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the label "early modern philosophy" is usually used to refer to a more specific period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the [[17th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 17th century]], posited to have begun with [[René Descartes]]; to have included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]; and to have ended with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Many stretch this period to [[18th-century philosophy]] (the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), thus including [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Schacht"/&gt;

The term is sometimes used more broadly and early modern philosophy is considered to have begun in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]; to have also included [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Thomas Paine]]; and to have ended at the latest in 1804 with the death of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Considered in this way, the period spans from [[Renaissance philosophy]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

'''Epilogism''' is a style of [[Inference]] invented by the ancient [[Empiric school]] of medicine. It is a theory-free method of looking at history by accumulating fact with minimal generalization and being conscious of the side effects of making causal claims. Epilogism is an inference which moves entirely within the domain of visible and evident things, it tries not to invoke [[unobservable]]s. It is tightly knit to the famous "tripos of medicine".

==Epilogism in popular culture==
Epilogism is discussed as a way of viewing history in [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)]] by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]].

{{Expand German|Extensionalismus|date=November 2014}}
'''Extensionalism''', in the [[philosophy of language]], in [[logic]] and [[semantics]], is the view that all languages or at least all scientific languages should be [[extensional]]. [[Rudolf Carnap]] (in his earlier work) and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] were prominent proponents of this view.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Fictionalism''' is the view in [[philosophy]] according to which statements that appear to be descriptions of the world should not be construed as such, but should instead be understood as cases of "make believe", of pretending to treat something as literally true (a "useful fiction"). Two important strands of fictionalism are [[modal fictionalism]] developed by [[Gideon Rosen]], which states that [[possible worlds]], regardless of whether they exist or not, may be a part of a useful discourse, and [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|mathematical fictionalism]] advocated by [[Hartry Field]], which states that talk of numbers and other mathematical objects is nothing more than a convenience for doing science. Also in [[meta-ethics]], there is an equivalent position called moral fictionalism (championed by [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]]). Many modern versions of fictionalism are influenced by the work of [[Kendall Walton]] in aesthetics.

Fictionalism consists in at least the following three theses:
# Claims made within the [[domain of discourse]] are taken to be [[truth-apt]]; that is, true or false
# The domain of discourse is to be interpreted at face value—not reduced to meaning something else 
# The aim of discourse in any given domain is not truth, but some other virtue(s) (e.g., simplicity, explanatory scope).

{{Classic element}}
The '''five elements''' philosophy in [[Japan]]ese [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], {{nihongo||五大|godai|lit. "five great"}}, is derived from Buddhist beliefs. It is perhaps best known in the [[Western world]] for its use in [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s famous text ''Gorin-no-sho'' (''[[The Book of Five Rings]]''), in which he explains different aspects of swordsmanship by assigning each aspect to an element.

==The elements==
The five elements are Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void.

===Earth===
[[wiktionary: 地|地]] ''Chi'' (sometimes ''ji'') or ''tsuchi'', meaning "[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]", represents the hard, solid objects of the earth. The most basic example of ''chi'' is in a stone. Stones are highly resistant to movement or change, as is anything heavily influenced by ''chi''. In people, the bones, muscles and tissues are represented by ''chi''. Emotionally, ''chi'' is predominantly associated with stubbornness, collectiveness, stability, physicality, and gravity. It is a desire to have things remain as they are; a resistance to change. In the mind, it is confidence. When under the influence of this ''chi'' mode or "mood", we are aware of our own physicality and sureness of action. This is a separate concept from the [[Qi|energy-force]], pronounced in Chinese as ''qì'' (also written ''ch'i'') and in Japanese as ''ki'', and written alternatively as 気, 氣, or 气.

===Water===
[[wiktionary: 水|水]] ''Sui'' or ''mizu'', meaning "[[Water (classical element)|Water]]", represents the fluid, flowing, formless things in the world. Outside of the obvious example of rivers and the lake, plants are also categorized under ''sui'', as they adapt to their environment, growing and changing according to the direction of the sun and the changing seasons. Blood and other bodily fluids are represented by ''sui'', as are mental or emotional tendencies towards adaptation and change. ''Sui'' can be associated with emotion, defensiveness, adaptability, flexibility, suppleness, and magnetism.

===Fire===
[[wiktionary: 火|火]] ''Ka'' or ''hi'', "[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]", represents the energetic, forceful, moving things in the world. Animals, capable of movement and full of forceful energy, are primary examples of ''ka'' objects. Bodily, ''ka'' represents our metabolism and body heat, and in the mental and emotional realms, it represents drive and passion. ''ka'' can be associated with security, motivation, desire, intention, and an outgoing spirit.

===Wind===
[[wiktionary: 風|風]] ''Fū'' or ''kaze'', meaning "[[Air (classical element)|Wind]]", represents things that grow, expand, and enjoy freedom of movement. Aside from air, smoke, and the like, ''fū'' can in some ways be best represented by the human mind. As we grow physically, we learn and expand mentally as well, in terms of our knowledge, our experiences, and our personalities. ''Fū'' represents breathing, and the internal processes associated with respiration. Mentally and emotionally, it represents an "open-minded" attitude and carefree feeling. It can be associated with will, elusiveness, evasiveness, benevolence, compassion, and wisdom.

===Void (Aether)===
{{See also|Śūnyatā}}
[[wiktionary: 空|空]] ''Kū'' or ''sora'', most often translated as "[[Aether (classical element)|Void]]", but also meaning "[[sky]]" or "[[Heaven]]", represents those things beyond our everyday experience, particularly those things composed of pure energy. Bodily, ''kū'' represents spirit, thought, and creative energy. It represents our ability to think and to communicate, as well as our creativity. It can also be associated with power, creativity, spontaneity, and inventiveness.

''Kū'' is of particular importance as the highest of the elements. In martial arts, particularly in fictional tales where the fighting discipline is blended with magic or the occult, one often invokes the power of the Void to connect to the [[Aether (classical element)|quintessential]] creative energy of the world. A warrior properly attuned to the Void can sense their surroundings and act without using the mind, and without using their "physical senses".

==Representations of the ''godai''==
The most common representations today of the five elements, outside of martial arts and fictional references, are found in [[Japanese Buddhist architecture|Buddhist architecture]]. Japanese [[Tōrō|stone lantern]]s as seen in [[Zen garden]]s and [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] have five divisions which represent the five elements, although the five segments can be hard to discern. The bottom-most piece, touching the ground, represents ''chi''; the next section represents ''sui''; ''ka'' is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while ''fū'' and ''kū'' are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky.

Another common symbol of the five elements is the ''[[gorintō]]'', a stone tower of modest size used mainly in Buddhist temples and cemeteries. It is composed from bottom to top of a cube, a sphere, a triangle, a crescent and something resembling a lotus flower, shapes that also have the meaning described above.

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C. James Goodwin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNsVUGTMcDoC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |isbn=978-0470522783 |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |edition=6th}}

Harper, Jr. |author=Robert C Bishop |isbn=978-0521882392 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilists thus consider the debate between libertarians and hard determinists over free will vs determinism a [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref name= Richards&gt;See, for example, {{cite book |title=Human Nature After Darwin: A Philosophical Introduction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KZ1NZmDGCEC&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152 |pages=142 ''ff'' |chapter=The root of the free will problem: kinds of non-existence |author= Janet Richards |year=2001 |isbn=978-0415212434 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different compatibilists offer very different definitions of what "free will" even means and consequently find different types of constraints to be relevant to the issue. Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent.

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia.

&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

====Related philosophical issues====

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T.

(1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason.

&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza.

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact.... Moral judgments ... must be ''a priori'' judgments."&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623–42 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity. The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.'' New York: Grune and Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they are acting in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect.

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions. Manuscript in preparation.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the last behaviour, "random" actions, may not be possible; when participants attempt to perform tasks in a random manner (such as generating random numbers), their behaviour betrays many patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Hillel, M. 2007. Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=75|pages=486–502|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.486|issue=3|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter.

In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style."&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; Dyson is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.

In 2012, he published (with [[William H. Press]]) a fundamental new result about the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] in [[PNAS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent"].

===Family===
With his first wife, the Swiss mathematician [[Verena Huber-Dyson]], Dyson had two children, [[Esther Dyson|Esther]] and [[George Dyson (science historian)|George]]. In 1958, he married Imme Jung, a [[Masters athletics (track and field)|masters runner]], and they had four more children, Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called "the most influential woman in all the computer world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26858383 |title=Esther Dyson: Breaking through tech's glass ceiling|last=McKelvey|first=Tara|date=27 May 2014|access-date=11 February 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son George is a [[history of science|historian of science]],&lt;ref&gt;See excerpt from [http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Dyson.html Digerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite] by John Brockman (HardWired Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose books is ''[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)#note-0|Project Orion]]: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965''.

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===

{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration.

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

{{quote|I'm not saying the warming doesn't cause problems, obviously it does. Obviously we should be trying to understand it. I'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated. They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important. Poverty, infectious diseases, public education and public health. Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094244/http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|archivedate=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|title= University of Michigan 2005 Winter Commencement Address|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

He is a member of the academic advisory council of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]], a climate sceptic think tank chaired by [[Nigel Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegwpf.org/who-we-are/academic-advisory-council/ |title=Academic Advisory Council |website=The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) |access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) "Shelters" in ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of failure===
{{quote|You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at [[bicycles]], there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.&lt;ref name=BrandInterview&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/dyson.html?pg=7&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Interview by Stewart Brand, February 1998].

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

{{quote|I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''internal measurement''' is one of the measurement theories. From,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kouichirou Matsuno
|year=2000
|title=What is Internal Measurement? (in Japanese)
|publisher=Seidosha
|location=Japan
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; we introduce the definition of the internal measurement. 
The experience consists of "unremitting measurements". These "unremitting measurements" appear only in the experience. In the experience, if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a "measurement which identifies another individual", where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual. Moreover, a "measurement which identifies another individual" is unremitting in the experience. As above a measurement such that if any individual measure another individual then this measurement inherent in "unremitting measurements" is called the internal measurement. This theory is found by Kouichirou Matsuno and 
is developed by [[Yukio-Pegio Gunji]].  

There is a likeness between internal measurement and [[endophysics]]. 
However, they have slight difference, that is, internal measurement have before-after logical asymmetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The '''International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science''' ('''HOPOS''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[organization]] for promoting the study of the [[history]] of [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hopos.org&lt;/ref&gt; The society promotes exchange of ideas among scholars through meetings, journals, and online. It maintains an active email listserv, HOPOS-G.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/vt.edu/forum/#!forum/hopos-g&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal ''HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science'' is published by [[The University of Chicago Press]]. The first issue appeared in 2011. The journal provides an outlet for interdisciplinary work that helps to explain the links among philosophy, science, and mathematics, along with the social, economic, and political context. The journal features articles, book reviews, and annually, an extensive essay review of the recent scholarship in a growing area of the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/hopos.html&lt;/ref&gt; The editor-in-chief is Rose-Mary Sargent of [[Merrimack College]].

HOPOS has held international meetings every two years since 1996. The first meeting was in Roanoke, Virginia, hosted by [[Virginia Tech]]. The 2016 meeting, HOPOS 2016, will take place at the [[University of Minnesota]], hosted by the University and by the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science.,&lt;ref&gt;http://hopos2016.umn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mcps.umn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous meetings have been held in Halifax, Budapest, Vancouver, Paris, San Francisco, Montréal, Vienna, and South Bend. An archive of meeting websites can be found on the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/hopos/conferences.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993-2010, the organization produced a newsletter. Archives can be found on the website of HOPOS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/hopos/newsletters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

HOPOS is a member organization of [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]].

# She has radical and continuing doubts about the [[final vocabulary]] she currently uses, because she has been impressed by other vocabularies, vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered; 
# She realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts; 
# Insofar as she philosophizes about her situation, she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others, that it is in touch with a power not herself. |Richard Rorty|Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p.73}}

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'', Rorty argues that [[Proust]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Heidegger]], [[Derrida]], and [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov|Nabokov]], among others, all exemplify Ironism to different extents.

The principle of '''Irreducibility''', in [[philosophy]], has the sense that a complete account of an [[entity]] will not be possible at lower levels of [[explanation]] and which has novel properties beyond prediction and explanation. Another way to state this is that [[Occam's razor]] requires the elimination of only those entities that are unnecessary, not as many entities as could conceivably be eliminated. [[Lev Vygotsky]] provides the following illustration of the idea, in his ''Thought and Language'':

:"Two essentially different modes of analysis are possible in the study of [[psychology|psychological]] structures. It seems to us that one of them is responsible for all the failures that have beset former investigators of the old problem, which we are about to tackle in our turn, and that the other is the only correct way to approach it.

:The first method analyzes complex psychological wholes into "[[wiktionary:element|elements]]". It may be compared to the [[chemical analysis]] of water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], neither of which possesses the properties of the whole and each of which possesses properties not present in the whole. The student applying this method in looking for an explanation of some property of water &amp;mdash; why it extinguishes fire, for example &amp;mdash; will find to his surprise that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire ....

:In our opinion the right course to follow is to use the other type of analysis, which may be called "analysis into units". By "unit", we mean a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole, and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Not the chemical composition of water, but its molecules and their behaviour, are the key to the understanding of the properties of water ..."

In other words: to conserve the properties under investigation, it is necessary to remain within a certain level of complexity. Irreducibility is most often deployed in defence of the reality of human [[subjectivity]] and/or [[free will]], against those who treat such things as [[folk psychology]], such as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].

In “Life's Irreducible Structure”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/polanyi/Polanyi_Life_Structures.pdf|title=Life's Irreducible Structure|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1968|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michael Polanyi|Micheal Polanyi]] argues that higher-order sciences such as biology and other chemical processes can not be explained by the fundamentalist perspective.  Indeed, machines and the humans that make them fall into "boundary conditions" that produce phenomena that itself can not be reduced further. He writes &lt;blockquote&gt;The lowest level is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of words; the third, the joining of words that make sentences; the fourth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and the highest, the composition of the text. The principles of each level operate under the control of the next-higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with a grammar; and the sentences are fitted into a style, which in turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition. Thus each level is subject to dual control: (i) control in accordance with the laws that apply to its elements in themselves, and (ii) control in accordance with the laws of the powers that control the comprehensive entity formed by these elements&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is worth noting that Reductionism has not been ruled out as an explanation of these tipping-point, emergent behaviors.

'''Julio Cabrera''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] living in [[Brazil]]. He is a retired professor of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Brasília and former head of the department. Previously he taught in Argentina, at the National University of Córdoba, the University of Belgrano and then in Brazil at the Federal University of Santa Maria. Currently, he is a senior associate researcher, by invitation, in the Bioethics Doctoral Program of the University of Brasília. He is best known for his works on "negative ethics" and cinema and philosophy. Other areas of philosophy that he deals with are philosophy of language, logic and Latin American philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/fundacionjaimeroca/docs/juliocabrera] ''Entrevista al Dr. Julio Cabrera'', Serie Entrevistas, Fundación Dr. Jaime Roca, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4175] ''Sem grandes intuiçoes, nao há grande filosofia'', Instituto Humanitas Unisinos, number 379, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/preview.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;id=K4781131E6] Biogram on Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-i-am.html] J. Cabrera, ''Who I am''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative ethics ==

In his book ''A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Políticas negativas y ética de la libertación. ¿Es posible ser um pessimista revolucionário? (Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Projeto de Ética Negativa'', São Paulo: Mandacaru, 1989 (second edition: ''A Ética e Suas Negações, Não nascer, suicídio e pequenos assassinatos'', Rio De Janeiro: Rocco, 2011).

Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situação humana, ética e procriação responsável'', Brasília: UnB, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia'', São Paulo: Nankin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (a sort of second volume of ''Cine: 100 anos de filosofia'') and  ''Diálogo/cinema''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J. Cabrera, ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch'', Enl@ce, year 6, number 2, Maracaibo: Universidad del Zulia, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Três ensaios sobre a repetição: Kierkegaard, Jarmush, Hitchcock, Van Sant e três damas que desembarcam antes de chegar (Uma reflexão transversal sobre escrita e imagem)'', in: Ri.

Cabrera, ''Repetición y cine vacío'', La Cueva de Chauvet, La Plata: Malisia, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, filosofía y filosofía analítica'', in: F. Santamaria Velasco et alia, ''Cine y Pensamiento'', Estéticas contemporáneas 9, Bogotá-Medellin: Universidad Claretiana, Universidad Santo Tomás, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Margens das filosofias da linguagem: conflitos e aproximações entre analíticas, hermenêuticas, fenomenologias e metacríticas da linguagem'', Brasília: UnB, 2003 (reprinted in 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, O.L. Da Silva Filho, ''Inferências Lexicais e Interpretação de Redes de Predicados'', Brasília: UnB, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autoname3&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Unijuí: Unijuí, 2010. (second edition in 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Esboço de una introducción al pensamiento desde América Latina'', in: ''Problemas do pensamento filosófico na América Latina'', A.V. Flores, W. Frank (editors), Goiânia: Phillos, 2018, pp. 12–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14794">A person's '''life stance''', or '''lifestance''', is their relation with what they accept as being of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]]. It involves the presuppositions and theories upon which such a stance could be made, a [[belief system]], and a commitment to potentially working it out in one's [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref&gt;
For example, as treated in ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'' by [[Daniel Dennett]] {{ISBN|0-262-54053-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It connotes an integrated perspective on reality as a whole and how to assign valuations, thus being a concept similar or equivalent to that of a [[worldview]]; with the latter word (derived from the German "Weltanschauung") being generally a more common and comprehensive term. Like the term "worldview", the term "life stance" is intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion|religious]] perspectives (for instance: "a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] life stance"  or "a&amp;nbsp;[[Christian]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[Neopaganism|Pagan]] life stance"), as well as non-religious spiritual or philosophical alternatives (for instance: "a&amp;nbsp;[[Humanism|humanist]] life&amp;nbsp;stance" or "a [[personism|personist]] life stance" or "a [[Deep Ecology]] life stance"), without discrimination in favour of any.&lt;ref name = "Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

== Origins of the phrase ==
[[humanism|Humanists]] interested in educational matters apparently coined the [[neologism]] ''life stance'' in the mid-1970s; [[Harry Stopes-Roe]] of the [[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Press Association]] and [[British Humanist Association]] developed the concept originally in that context.&lt;ref&gt;
On "life stance education" see Stopes-Roe (1976), and Stopes-Roe (1983). Compare with the advocacy of "Education in Life Stances" in Cox (1975), on which also see Greer (1985, pp.  16–17)). The British Humanist Association pamphlet, ''Objective, Fair and Balanced'' (1975), includes the text of a letter by Stopes-Roe, printed in the ''Times Educational Supplement'' of 12 July 1974, which refers to "stances for living". It also cites the City of Birmingham's ''Agreed Syllabus of Religious Education'', dated 7 May 1974: "it introduces the new term "stance for living". (British Humanist Association, 1975, p. 15). For the related "life stance education" offered to non-religious pupils in Finland, see Slotte (2008).
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originally arose in the context of debates over the controversial&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes (2008, p. 75), notes that the controversy reached Parliament.  Hull (1984, p. 111) notes that "an attempt was made in the spring of 1976 to introduce a Private Members Bill into the House of Commons which would have replaced religious education by 'Education in Stances for Living'". The Bill was published in "Objective, Fair and Balanced – a new law for religion in education", written by Harry Stopes-Roe and David Pollock for the British Humanist Association (1975)
&lt;/ref&gt; content of the City of [[Birmingham| Birmingham's]] ''Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education'', 1975.  That document referred to "non-religious stances for living". According to Barnes:

{{quote|It was the first syllabus to abandon the aim of Christian nurture and to embrace a multi-faith, phenomenological model of religious education; and it was also the first syllabus to require a ''systematic'' study of non-religious 'stances for living', such as Humanism, and for such study to begin in the primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes (2008, p. 75)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the late 1980s Harry Stopes-Roe initiated a successful campaign for the adoption of the term by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and by other organisations (see also his comments quoted below on its provenance).&lt;ref&gt;
Stopes-Roe's advocacy of the term outside the literature of religious education was first published as Stopes-Roe (1987), but the article was in circulation at a Board meeting of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] in October 1987 (See Walter 1988a, p. 4). The article was reprinted in ''New Humanist'' (Stopes Roe 1988a) and Kurtz (1989). Stopes-Roe revisited the subject in Stopes-Roe (1996), and wrote the article on "Life stance" for the ''New Encyclopedia of Unbelief'' (Stopes-Roe 2007). See also the statement "[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more Humanism is eight letters, no more]", signed by [[H.J. Blackham|Harold Blackham]], [[Levi Fragell]], [[Corliss Lamont]], [[Harry Stopes-Roe]], and [[Rob Tielman]].
&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was not an uncontroversial proposal among humanists.&lt;ref name = "needforlifestance"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21) commented that "I have found the degree of opposition to the term "life stance" among Humanists more surprising than the religionist's objection." See also the overview of the debate between Walter (1988a and 1988b) and Stopes-Roe (1988a and 1988b) in Fowler (1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=z5k5A0_nFogC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22life%20stance%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22life%20stance%22&amp;f=false pp. 3–4]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced as part of an attempt to establish a clear identity for Humanism, in order to gain recognition and respect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more See "Humanism is eight letters, no more"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stopes-Roe:

{{quote|"Life stance" is an expression that has been current in Britain for more than ten years and is now gaining acceptance worldwide, to describe what is good in both Humanism and religion – without being encumbered by what is bad in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p.19)
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Definition==

Harry Stopes-Roe, who fought for the term's acceptance by the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, defined "life stance" as follows:

{{quote|"Life stance" - The style and content of an individual's or a community's relationship with that which is of ultimate importance; the presuppositions and commitments of this, and the consequences for living which flow from it. (Each individual or community hopes that it has come to a good and well-founded relationship, but the word is usually used without implying that this really is so).|[[Harry Stopes-Roe]]&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"&gt;Stopes-Roe (1988a, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British Humanist Association, drawing in part on jurisprudence related to the term "religion or belief" in the European Convention on Human Rights, has put forward a more analytical definition:

{{quote|A collective belief that attains a sufficient level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance and that relates the nature of life and the world to morality, values and/or the way its believers should live.|[[British Humanist Association]]&lt;ref&gt;
Memorandum from the BHA to the Charity Commission on Religion and Non-Religious Beliefs in Charity Law, August 2007: see http://www.humanism.org.uk/documents/3917&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Orthography==
A life stance may be distinguished from general support of a cause by [[capitalization]] of the first letter. For instance, the life stance of Humanism is distinguished from [[humanism]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/DoerrND02.htm Humanism Unmodified] By Edd Doerr. Published in the ''Humanist'' (November/December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many life stances may contain humanism to a greater or lesser extent as [[instrumental value]] in order to fulfill their own chosen [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value(s)]]. However, Humanism regards it as having intrinsic value.

Not all life stances use this orthography.

==Spectrum==
The term was intended to be a ''shared'' label encompassing both [[religion]]s and alternatives to religion, without discrimination in favour of either.&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;

A life stance differs from a [[World view|worldview]] or a belief system in that the term ''life stance'' emphasizes a focus on what is of ultimate importance. Life stance differs from [[eupraxsophy]] in that the latter typically implies a strictly non-theistic outlook, whereas a life stance can be theistic or non-theistic, supernaturalistic or naturalistic.

===Religious life stances===
{{Main|Religion}}
A ''religion'' is a set of beliefs and practices, often centered upon specific supernatural and/or moral claims about [[reality]], the [[cosmos]], and [[human nature]], and often codified as [[prayer]], [[ritual]], and [[law]].  Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural [[tradition]]s, writings, history, and [[mythology]], as well as personal [[faith]] and [[mysticism|mystic experience]]. The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction.

In the frame of [[European religious thought]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; religions present a common quality, the "hallmark of patriarchal religious thought": the division of the world in two comprehensive domains, [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|one sacred, the other profane]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1976, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is often described as a communal system for the coherence of belief focusing on a system of thought, unseen being, person, or object, that is considered to be [[supernatural]], sacred, [[Divinity|divine]], or of the highest [[truth]].  
[[Moral code]]s, practices, values, institutions, tradition, [[philosophy]], rituals, and [[scripture]]s are often traditionally associated with the core belief. Religion is also often described as a "[[way of life]]".

===Non-religious life stances===
{{Further|Irreligion|Secular religion}}
Alternatives to religion include life stances based on [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]], [[freethought]], [[pantheism]], [[secular humanism]], [[spiritual but not religious]] (SBNR), [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[existentialism]], modern incarnations of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]], or general [[secularism]].

====Humanism====

[[Humanism]] is an example of life stance which may be considered to be religious (usually in a non-theistic, ethical sense) or non-religious or anti-religious. One of Stopes-Roe's reasons for advocating the adoption of "life stance" as a label for the Humanist movement, was his hope that it would end the arguments between the different sides as to how best to characterise their position (note that Stopes-Roe uses the term "god-religious" to distinguish theists from non-theists in what follows):

{{quote|Humanists are divided into two camps... according to how they respond to the word "religion". Do they... respond negatively or positively? The ferocity of the antipathy on the one hand, and the power of the concern on the other, that is generated by this word quite obliterates reasoned discussion of many substantial and important questions on how we should develop Humanism. Likewise, our discussions with the god-religious are confused and frustrated. We need a new term for the idea and ideal of religion, opened out so that it is not discriminatory. Let this be "life stance". Could we, perhaps, bury the hatchet of "religion" and work together?&lt;ref name="Stopes-Roe 1988a, p.21"/&gt;}}

Bill Cooke comments:
{{quote|Harry Stopes-Roe's contribution is significant because it makes clear humanism's value as a legitimate system of belief, without it being a pseudo-religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke 2003 (p. 223)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Researchers in [[positive psychology]] study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). "Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being." ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0060920432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making a fuller contribution by utilizing one's personal strengths,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195167015}}. {{cite web |title=See brief summary |url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2002). ''Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.'' New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyle PA, Buchman AS, Barnes LL, Bennett DA. Effect of a purpose in life on risk of incident Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older persons. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2010;67:304–310.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kim E, Sun J, Park N, Kubzansky L, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced risk of myocardial infarction among older US adults with coronary heart disease: A two-year follow-up. Journal of Behavioral Medicine. (2):124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of stroke,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kim ES, Sun JK, Park N, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced incidence of stroke in older adults: The Health and Retirement Study. Journal of Psychosomatic Research. 2013;74(5):427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased longevity in both American and Japanese samples.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle PA, Barnes LL, Buchman AS, Bennett DA. Purpose in life is associated with mortality among community-dwelling older persons. Psychosomatic Medicine. 2009;71:574–579.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the British [[National Health Service]] began recommending a five step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:  (1) Connect with community and family; (2) Physical exercise; (3) Lifelong learning; (4) Giving to others; (5) [[Mindfulness]] of the world around you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/improve-mental-wellbeing.aspx|title=Five steps to mental wellbeing|work=www.nhs.uk|date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything. We're just the products of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The God Delusion|last = Dawkins|first = Richard|publisher = Houghton Mifflin|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0618680009|location = |pages = 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|The [[metric expansion of space]]. The [[inflationary epoch]] is the expansion of the [[metric tensor]] at left.]]

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M.

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]].

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

===19th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|19th-century philosophy}}

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life].

[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). "Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?" (Chapter 4). In E. Morscher, ed., ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McNaughton |first=David |date=August 1988 |title=Moral Vision: An Introduction to Ethics |chapter=Section 1.5: Moral Freedom and the Meaning of Life |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0631159452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[logical positivists]] said:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} "Expressed in language, the question is meaningless"; because, ''in'' life the statement the "meaning of x", usually denotes the ''consequences'' of x, or the ''significance'' of x, or ''what is notable'' about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals "x", in the statement the "meaning of x", the statement becomes [[recursion|recursive]], and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144956/http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further information|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity.

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God.

The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality].

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name="weightman"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |date=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=978-0140514803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |date=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1421265311 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=978-1421265315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s ''All is Vanity,'' an example of ''[[vanitas]],'' depicts a young [[woman]] amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the [[mirror]] of her [[lowboy|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it.

I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* Life has no meaning, but as humans we try to associate a meaning or purpose so we can justify our existence.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28933">'''Modern Stoicism'''  is an intellectual and popular movement in the late 20th and early 21st century which attempts to revive the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] in the modern setting. It  is not to be confused with [[Neostoicism]], an analogous phenomenon in the 17th century. The term "Modern Stoicism" covers both the revival of interest in the Stoic philosophy and the philosophical efforts to adjust
Ancient Stoicism to the language and conceptual framework of the present.  'The rise of Modern Stoicism' has received attention in the international media since around November 2012 when the first Annual Stoic Week event was organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joe Gelonesi|title=The rise of Modern Stoicism|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/modern-day-stoicism/5896364|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|agency=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Philosophically ===
Modern Stoicism has developed in the context of the 20th-century surge of interest in virtue ethics in general. "The [...] work by philosophers like [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Martha Nussbaum]], among others, have brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant [[Kantian ethics|Kantian]]-[[Deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]]-[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches."&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/ |title=Stoicism |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo|date=December 14, 2016 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Stoicism draws a lot from the late 20th and early 21st century spike in publications of scholarly works on ancient Stoics. Beyond that, “the Modern Stoicism movement traces its roots to the work of Dr Albert Ellis, who developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/ |title=REBT Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Aaron T. Beck,&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck/ |title=Arron T Beck |website=Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who is regarded by many as the father to early versions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. [[Viktor Frankl]] also found stoicism useful while he was imprisoned in a [[Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]; he later developed his theory known as [[logotherapy]]. &lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

One major premise of Modern Stoicism can be expressed as, in [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]'s words, "it is interesting to try to imagine what might have happened if Stoicism had had a continuous twenty-three-hundred-year history; if Stoics had had to confront Bacon and Descartes, Newton and Locke, Hobbes and Bentham, Hume and Kant, Darwin and Marx."&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt; Or, as Massimo Pigliucci puts it more concisely, "it is worth considering what it means to 'be a Stoic' in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/how-to-be-a-stoic/?_r=0|title=How To Be A Stoic?|last=Pigliucci|first=Massimo|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major modern work that spelled out the key premises of Modern Stoicism is, arguably, ''A New Stoicism''&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; by Lawrence Becker, first published in 1997.&lt;ref name="PigliucciIEP" /&gt; For other important books, see the notable books section below.

===Psychology and psychotherapy===
Stoic philosophy was the original philosophical inspiration for modern [[cognitive psychotherapy]], particularly as mediated by Dr Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), the major precursor of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]].  The original cognitive therapy treatment manual for depression by Aaron T. Beck et al. states, "The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery  (1979)  Cognitive Therapy of Depression, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known quotation from ''The Handbook'' of Epictetus was taught to most clients during the initial session of traditional REBT by Ellis and his followers: "It's not the events that upset us, but our judgments about the events."  This subsequently became a common element in the "socialization" phase of many other approaches to CBT. The question of Stoicism's influence on modern psychotherapy, particularly REBT and CBT, was described in detail in ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy'' (2010) by Donald Robertson.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, several early 20th century psychotherapists were influenced by stoicism, most notably the "rational persuasion" school founded by the Swiss neurologist and psychotherapist [[Paul Charles Dubois|Paul DuBois]], who drew heavily on Stoicism in his clinical work and encouraged his clients to study passages from Seneca as homework assignments.

=== As a popular movement ===
It is characteristic of the Modern Stoicism movement that it is global and that it relies heavily on the social media and online communities. As E.O. Scott puts it "Modern Stoicism is really a “Web 2.0” phenomenon."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ericsiggyscott.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/a-quick-map-of-the-online-stoic-community/|title=A Quick Map of the Online Stoic Community|last=Scott|first=E.O.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key sites is the Modern Stoicism website, which harbors the Stoicism Today blog and hosts the Annual Stoic Week (online) and Stoicon (offline) events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/12/05/meet-real-stoics-taking-psychology-back-3rd-century-bc-287901.html|title=Meet the Real Stoics Taking Psychology Back to the 3rd Century BC|first=Timothy Willis On 12/1/14 at 7:33|last=AM|date=1 December 2014|website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important place is the New Stoa, which was founded in May 1996 and is arguably the first lasting stoic community on the internet. Three key podcasts talking about Stoicism applied to modern thought are the ''Stoic Solutions Podcast'' hosted by Justin Vacula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://justinvacula.com|title=Stoic Solutions Podcast - Practical Wisdom for Everyday Life|website=Stoic Solutions Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''The Practical Stoic Podcast'' hosted by Simon Drew &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://practicalstoicpodcast.podbean.com|title=The Practical Stoic Podcast with Simon Drew|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steve Karafit's ''The Sunday Stoic'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundaystoic.wixsite.com/home|title=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|work=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of personal blogs exploring stoicism, some of them run by notable stoic scholars (e.g. Massimo Pigliucci, William Irvine or John Sellars) and some by therapists who explore stoic applications (e.g. Donald Robertson). In addition, articles on Stoicism have appeared on popular websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stoicism-lessons-life-death-2017-6|title=7 insights from the ancient philosophy of Marcus Aurelius that will change the way you think about life, death, and time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/want-happiness-become-a-p_b_3759317.html|title=Want Happiness? Become a Practicing Stoic|last=Shammas|first=Michael|date=January 23, 2014|website=The Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In E.O.Scott's words, "[the] potent combination of social media and a few highly publicized books and articles [...] has recently launched stoicism on an exponential growth curve."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is a variety of stoic meetups and groups based in places like Australia, Denver, Dublin, Edinburgh, Fremont, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Milwaukee, New York, Orlando, San Francisco, Toronto and Warsaw - amongst others.  According to E.O.Scott, "arguably the most important and influential gathering place for Modern Stoics [online]"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is the "stoicism group" on Facebook of ~27 000 people (as of July 19, 2017). The analogous Reddit group has amassed ~96 400 users (as of June 11, 2018). Beyond the Anglophone there is the “Sztuka życia według stoików” site run by Piotr Stankiewicz, "Stoicyzm Uliczny" run by Marcin Fabjański and Centrum Praktyki Stoickiej run by Tomasz Mazur and others.

Applications of Modern Stoicism are reported across industries. According to "Forbes," Modern Stoic thought "hold[s] fascinating promise for business and government leaders tackling global problems in a turbulent, post-recession slump."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2013/12/01/want-an-unconquerable-mind-try-stoic-philosophy/#7b97cceb750c|title=Want an Unconquerable Mind? Try Stoic Philosophy|last=Sheffield|first=Carrie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two Stoic academics, Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos, have warned against using "life-hack Stoicism" or "Silicon Valley Stoicism", as the primary means of understanding Stoic philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/04/17/life-hack-stoicism-is-it-worth-it/|title=Life-Hack Stoicism—Is It Worth It?|last=Whiting|first=Kai|date=2018-04-17|work=The Partially Examined Life Philosophy Podcast|access-date=2018-04-26|last2=Konstantakos|first2=Leonidas|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequently, they discussed on a popular Stoic blog, Stoicism's role in advocating for change in society, including when it comes to standing against gender-based discrimination in the workplace &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-beyond-the-self/|title=Taking Stoicism Beyond the Self: The Power To Change Society|last=Whiting|first=Kai|last2=Konstankos|first2=Leonidas|date=5 May 2018|website=The Daily Stoic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similarities of Modern Stoicism and Third Wave [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] have been suggested as well, and its potency in treating depression has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/10146546/Anxious-Depressed-Try-Greek-philosophy.html|title=Anxious?

== Key concepts ==
=== Problems with the appeal to nature ===
Presumably, the single most difficult challenge that Modern Stoicism faces is its relationship to the core principle of Ancient Stoicism, that is to the principle of “following nature.” In a word, the Ancient Stoics put forward it was unquestionable that in order to live a good life, one needed to live consistently with nature. According to the Ancient Stoics, nature was by definition good and everything which was conformable to nature was deemed good. Moreover, the Ancient Stoics had a teleological outlook on the world, that is, they held that everything in the universe was purposefully and rationally organized to a good end.

However, this view is much more difficult to uphold in the present day. As Becker puts it, “science presented significant challenges to our [Stoic] metaphysical views.”&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Stoicism|last=Becker|first=Lawrence|publisher=Princetion University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The notion of the rational organization of the world seems much more doubtful in the 21st century than it, presumably, was two millennia ago. “When we face the universe,” Becker writes, “we confront its indifference to us and our own insignificance to it. It takes no apparent notice of us, has no role other than Extra for us to play, no aim for us to follow.”&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{rp|11}} Even more pressing questions are raised when we face our own human realm, with the long and still expanding record of genocide and atrocity and the manslaughter that followed. These are major challenges for the ancient Stoic view of the world as a rational and essentially good being.

We happen upon an analogous problem if we narrow down our interest to human nature (as contrasted to the nature of the universe as a whole). In other words, the idea of “following our human nature” also raises serious questions. As Becker describes it, “it is ‘natural’ to find these [defining] traits in human character and conduct, but it is equally natural to find a significant number of exceptions. As a result, none of these characteristics fits into the most familiar forms of ethical argument from human nature, e.g. (a) that humans are by nature X, and that Y is contrary to X, hence, that Y is contrary to human nature; or (b) that X is what defines the unique function (the essence) of a human being, thus to flourish as a human being is to excel at X."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, “following human nature” yields no specific guidelines for conduct either. All told, this is one of the central problems for Modern Stoicism: that in the 21st century it is far more difficult to ground our ethical framework in “nature,” be it universal, cosmic nature, or to special human nature.

=== Following nature as following the facts ===
Becker acknowledges this problem and even goes to the point of asserting that “stoic ethics would be much better off without its ‘follow nature’ slogan."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Yet, he reflects that the stoics are, “however, too deeply branded with it to renounce it now. The best we can do is reinterpret it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

The reinterpretation he proposes is this. “Following nature means following the facts. It means getting the facts about the physical and social world we inhabit, and the facts about our situation in it [...] before we deliberate about normative matters. It means facing those facts - accepting them for exactly what they are, no more and no less - before we draw normative conclusions from them. It means doing ethics from the facts constructing normative propositions a posteriori. It means adjusting those normative propositions to fit changes in the facts, and accepting those adjustments for exactly what they are, no more and no less. And it means living within the facts - within the realm of actual rather than hypothetical norm.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

This process of “getting the facts about the [...] world”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; happens in some measure (but not exclusively) through science. In Becker’s words, “The biological, behavioral, and social sciences contribute to ethics in three important ways: they offer a wealth of material that can be used in the naturalistic arguments [...], they offer explanatory theories (e.g. from evolutionary biology) that help separate relatively fixed traits from transient or malleable ones and they offer powerful, elaborate analyses of learning, rationality, and rational choice."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Ethical reasoning of a stoic “cannot begin until all relevant description, representation, and prediction are in hand, [...] – until, let us say, the empirical work is done.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; This empirical work may be obtained by the scientific method and thus the principle of “following facts” can be (in some contexts) read as “not contradicting science” (not to be confused with simple “following science,” which would be reductive and misleading).

=== Virtue, agency, happiness ===
Becker organizes his reading of stoic ethics around the concept of agency. “The Development of Virtue [happens through] the Perfection of Agency,”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; or through the “ideal agency”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; as he calls it. In other words, this can be described as the belief in the “inherent primacy of virtue in terms of maximization of one’s agency.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt; This agency is understood in terms of “a balance of control and stability”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; and is executed all-things-considered, i.e. upon having obtained the most detailed information about the facts as available.

Happiness, in this view, is also explained and achieved through agency. “We hold,” this is Becker again, “that happiness as understood by mature and fit agents is a property of whole lives, not of transient mental states. We hold that it is achievable only through a proper balance of stability and control in the exercise of agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; And, “this sort of happiness with one’s life also appears to be a psychological consequence of healthy agency [...] The life of a stoic sage is filled with such happiness, as a consequence of virtue."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Degrees of virtue ===
In Becker’s version of Stoicism, several dogmas of Ancients Stoics are questioned or challenged. For example, the traditional stoic all-or-nothing understanding of virtue is questioned (to some extent). In the original, Orthodox Stoicism one was either a perfect sage or no sage at all, there was no “middle ground,” or “in between.” The Ancient Stoic virtue admits of no degrees. And yet, Becker lays ground for a softer, more nuanced approach. “You can drown,” he writes, “face down on the calm surface of the sea as surely as at the bottom. [...] We [i.e. the Modern Stoics] follow later colleagues in thinking that these doctrines are untenable.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Aspirations for universality ===
Another dogma of the Ancient Stoics that is sometimes questioned in Modern Stoicism is the idea that the gateways of stoic philosophy are open to everyone and that living a stoic life is definitely the best option for every human being. E.g. in Becker’s ''New Stoicism'' suggests that “acting appropriately, as understood here, is a special kind of optimization project – one that it is logically possible to reject. (Which people with compulsive, obsessive, or addictive personalities may in fact reject.) [Modern Stoic] claim is, only healthy agents, at least those well along the road to fitness in their deliberative powers, cannot plausibly reject it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Stoicism versus Aristotle ===
Another example of possible discrepancies between the Modern Stoic approach and Ancient Stoicism is the question of whether a certain amount of external goods is required for a good life. In the Orthodox Stoic view there are absolutely no entry conditions to living a stoic life. One can become a sage no matter the circumstances: be it poverty, illness, physical adversity and so on. This issue has been traditionally the bone of contention between the stoics (who held the mentioned position) and the followers of Aristotle (who held that a certain amount of external goods is necessary for development of virtue). In this context, Becker’s words are quite non-orthodox coming from the stoic position. He writes that  “it is [...] plausible to conclude, however, that there is an identifiable kernel of bodily and psychological health that is a necessary condition of all further development. If this kernel is damaged, so is the capacity to develop agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Dichotomy of control ===
A very important concept of Traditional Stoicism is the distinction between things within one’s power and not within our power. While this concept is embraced fully by many Modern Stoics, some reinterpret it. Becker, for instance, points out that the whole idea of the dichotomy is in fact a major oversimplification. As he puts it, “[the] distinction between things that are within our control, or ‘up to us,’ and those who are not [...] [is] misleading.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Instead, he proposes to read it along the lines of “it is wise to calibrate the strength, depth, and dissemination of our attachments to the fragility and transience of the objects involved.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

On the other hand, William Irvine goes even further and undermines the central premise of the dichotomy, i.e. that the distinction between things “in our power” and “not in our power” is sharp and that there is no third option. In other words, Irvine suggests the possibility of turning the “dichotomy of control” into a “trichotomy of control.” Irvine argues “We can restate Epictetus’s dichotomy as follows: There are things over which we have complete control and things over which we have no control at all. As well as suggesting "the dichotomy is a false dichotomy, since it ignores the existence of things over which we have some but not complete control.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to the Good Life. The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy|last=Irvine|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigliucci describes it as follows: “some things are up to us (chiefly, our judgments and actions), some things are not up to us (major historical events, natural phenomena), but on a number of other things we have partial control. Irvine recasts the third category in terms of internalized goals, which makes more sense of the original dichotomy.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

=== The question of ascesis and renunciation ===
There is also no unity in evaluating the ascetic elements in stoicism and in defining the sage’s attitude towards the ordinary pleasures of life. Becker mentions “the confusion, both among stoics and their critics” and the “false notion that the stoic ideal is a life devoid of the ordinary pleasures of sex, food, drink, music, wealth, fame, friends, and so on”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; (according to Becker this confusion happens because “stoics have occasionally claimed that, for the sage, ''eudaiomonia'' somehow replaces ordinary happiness”.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, Stankiewicz argued against the “ascetic misinterpretation,” saying that “stoicism is not asceticism and a stoic is not a monk. In fact, it is the school of The Pale Epicureans that is closer to the ideal of abstemiousness. The stoic proposal is far broader and it extends far beyond the narrow passage of the ascetic way.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoicism Today: Selected Writings vol. II|last=Ussher [ed.]|first=Patrick|publisher=Stoicism Today|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “we [the Modern Stoics] must face the lushness, diversity and – yes! – sensuality of life and we have to live and thrive inside this world, accepting it as it is. Unlike a monk, a stoic doesn’t dodge the myriad of different aspects of the earthly and sensual life.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the other hand, Kevin Patrick refutes this argument, ridiculing it as “hedonic stoicism” and saying that the mentioned position “falls into the more common trap and misinterpretation, that since externals are indifferent to us, we should go ahead and indulge in all of those things for which we have a proclivity.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; “Modern Stoics,” he concludes, “ought to be stoics.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Irvine takes a more modest stance and he proposes a program of “voluntary discomfort.” As he describes it: “By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort – by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed – we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4395">{{distinguish|Moore's paradox}}
The '''paradox of analysis''' is a paradox that concerns how an [[analysis]] can be both correct and informative.  Although the problem takes its origin from the conflict in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'', it was formulated in its complete form by philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', and first named by [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] in his 1942 article "The Notion of Analysis in Moore's Philosophy".

==The paradox==
A [[conceptual analysis]] is something like the definition of a word.  However, unlike a standard dictionary definition (which may list examples or talk about related terms as well), a completely correct analysis of a concept in terms of others seems like it should have exactly the same meaning as the original concept.  Thus, in order to be correct, the analysis should be able to be used in any context where the original concept is used, without changing the meaning of the discussion in context.  Conceptual analyses of this sort are a major goal of [[analytic philosophy]].

However, if such an analysis is to be useful, it should be informative.  That is, it should tell us something we don't already know (or at least, something one can imagine someone might not already know).  But it seems that no conceptual analysis can both meet the requirement of correctness and of informativeness, on these understandings of the requirements.

To see why, consider a potential simple analysis:

:(1) For all x (any given member of a class or set), x is a brother if and only if x is a male sibling	

One can say that (1) is correct because the expression "brother" represents the same concept as the expression "male sibling," and (1) seems to be informative because the two expressions are not identical.  And if (1) is truly correct, then "brother" and "male sibling" must be interchangeable:

:(2) For all x, x is a brother if and only if x is a brother

Yet (2) is not informative, so either (1) is not informative, or the two expressions used in (1) are not interchangeable (because they change an informative analysis into an uninformative one) so (1) is not actually correct.  In other words, if the analysis is correct and informative, then (1) and (2) must be essentially equal, but this is not true because (2) is not informative.  Therefore, it seems an analysis cannot be both correct and informative at the same time.

==Proposed resolutions==
One way to resolve this paradox is to redefine what is an analysis.  In explaining the paradox, a potential analysis is assumed to be a relation between concepts rather than the verbal expressions used to illustrate them.  If the verbal expression is part of the analysis, then we shouldn't expect complete [[salva veritate|intersubstitutivity]] even in cases of correct analyses.  However, this response seems to move the notion of analysis into mere linguistic definition, rather than doing interesting work with concepts.

Another response is to [[bite the bullet]] and just say that correct analyses are uninformative — which then raises the question of what positive cognitive notion should be used instead of this one, if any.

One further response would be to take [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s position and reject the notion of conceptual analysis altogether. This is a natural response to the rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. The fact that many philosophers have followed Quine in this direction is part of the reason that many now say that the term "analytic philosophy" is a misnomer.

The '''philosophy of information''' ('''PI''') is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies topics relevant to [[computer science]], [[information science]] and [[information technology]].

It includes:
# the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of [[information]], including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences
# the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf "What is the Philosophy of Information?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316090017/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}, ''Metaphilosophy'', 2002, (33), 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The philosophy of information (PI) has evolved from the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[logic of information]], [[cybernetics]], [[social theory]], [[ethics]] and the study of language and information.

===Logic of information===
The [[logic of information]], also known as the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

===Cybernetics===
One source for the philosophy of information can be found in the technical work of [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Alan Turing]] (though his work has a wholly different origin and theoretical framework), [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Claude Shannon]], [[Warren Weaver]], and many other scientists working on computing and information theory back in the early 1950s. See the main article on [[Cybernetics]].

Some important work on information and communication was done by [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues.

===Study of language and information===
Later contributions to the field were made by [[Fred Dretske]], [[Jon Barwise]], [[Brian Cantwell Smith]], and others.

The [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI)]] was founded at Stanford University in 1983 by philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and psychologists, under the direction of [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] and [[Jon Barwise]].

===P.I.===
More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by [[Luciano Floridi]], who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Definitions of "information"==

The concept ''information'' has been defined by several theorists.

===Peirce===
[[Charles S. Peirce]]'s theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the ''semeiotic'', now a major part of [[semiotics]]. For Peirce, information integrates the aspects of [[sign]]s and [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] separately covered by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], on the one hand, and by [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] on the other.

=== Shannon and Weaver ===
Claude E. Shannon, for his part, was very cautious: "The word 'information' has been given different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field." (Shannon 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;180){{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Thus, following Shannon, Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of (1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory; (2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and (3) what he called "influential" problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role. And these are only two early examples of the problems raised by any analysis of information.

A map of the main senses in which one may speak of information is provided by  [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/ the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article]. The previous paragraphs are based on it.

===Bateson===
[[Gregory Bateson]] defined information as "a difference that makes a difference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html Extract from "Steps to an Ecology of Mind"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204101244/http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html |date=2012-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Donald M. MacKay]]: information is a distinction that makes a difference.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy of Information.
Luciano Floridi. Chapter 4. Oxford University Press, USA (March 8, 2011) ASIN: 0199232385 [https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Information-Luciano-Floridi/dp/0199232385]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floridi===
According to Luciano Floridi{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as "information": 
*  Information about something (e.g. a train timetable)
*  Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints)
*  Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions)
*  Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint).

The word "information" is commonly used so metaphorically or so abstractly that the meaning is unclear.

==Philosophical directions==

===Computing and philosophy===

Recent creative advances and efforts in [[computing]], such as [[semantic web]], [[ontology engineering]], [[knowledge engineering]], and modern [[artificial intelligence]] provide [[philosophy]] with fertile ideas, new and evolving subject matters, methodologies, and models for philosophical inquiry. While [[computer science]] brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress in [[computer science]] would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies.

Classical topics in philosophy, namely, [[mind]], [[consciousness]], [[experience]], [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[truth]], [[morality]] and [[creativity]] are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in [[computer science]], e.g., in areas such as agent computing, [[software agents]], and intelligent mobile agent technologies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

According to Luciano Floridi "&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/publications/pdf/oppi.pdf ''Open Problems in the Philosophy of Information''] ''Metaphilosophy'' 35.4, 554-582. Revised version of ''The Herbert A. Simon Lecture on Computing and Philosophy'' given at Carnegie Mellon University in 2001, with [https://web.archive.org/web/20020111085711/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/video/CAP/CMU2001/Floridi/index.html RealVideo]&lt;/ref&gt; one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters:
# Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of [[thought experiment]], a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational [[Computer model|modeling]] schemes to questions in [[logic]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of biology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and so on.
# [[Pancomputationalism]]: On this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level of [[abstraction]], anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:
## how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems?
## what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an [[Information system|informational system]] (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)?

===Information and society===
Numerous philosophers and other thinkers have carried out philosophical studies of the social and cultural aspects of electronically mediated information.

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

{{Science|expanded=phil/hist}}

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

Retrieved 2015-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.&lt;ref name="Woodward2003" /&gt;

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 978-0-520-05155-3
 | pages = 124–1139
 | chapter = What Kind of Explanation is Truth?}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

==Philosophy of particular sciences==
{{quote|''There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2629-5|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22there+is+only+science+whose+philosophical+baggage+is+taken+on+board%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20is%20only%20science%20whose%20philosophical%20baggage%20is%20taken%20on%20board%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel Dennett|''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', 1995}}
In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of statistics===
{{Main|Philosophy of statistics}}
The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the [[foundations of statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the philosophical foundations and implications of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G.

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015).

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
The '''philosophy of war''' is the area of [[philosophy]] devoted to examining issues such as the causes of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the [[ethics]] of war. Certain aspects of the philosophy of war overlap with the [[philosophy of history]], [[political philosophy]], [[international relations]] and the [[philosophy of law]].

==Works about the philosophy of war==
[[File:Carl von Clausewitz.PNG|thumb|Carl von Clausewitz, painting by [[Karl Wilhelm Wach]].]]Perhaps the greatest and most influential work in the [[philosophy]] of war is ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. It combines observations on strategy with questions about [[human nature]] and the purpose of war. Clausewitz especially examines the [[teleology]] of war: whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself. He concludes that the latter cannot be so, and that war is "[[politics]] by different means"; i.e. that war must not exist only for its own sake. It must serve some purpose for the state.

[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war (and broader [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculations derived from [[Christianity]] and from Tolstoy's observations of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). It was influential on later thought about war. Tolstoy's [[Christian]]-centered philosophy of war (especially his essays "[[A Letter to a Hindu]]" and "[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]") was a direct influence on [[Gandhi]]'s [[Hinduism]]-centered [[non-violent resistance]] philosophy.

While [[Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu's]] ''[[The Art of War]]'', focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy, his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself (see the main Wikipedia article on ''The Art of War'' for a discussion of the application of Sun Tzu's philosophy to areas other than war). Parts of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli's]] masterpiece ''[[The Prince]]'' (as well as ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]]'') and parts of his own work titled ''The Art of War'' discuss some philosophical points relating to war, though neither book could be said to be a work in the philosophy of war.

==Just war theory==
[[Just war theory]] is a sect of war philosophy thought to have been founded by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].  The philosophy of just war theorizes what aspects of war are justifiable according to morally acceptable principles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Augustine/augustine_justwar.html|title=Great Philosophers: Augustine on War|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just war theory is based upon four core criteria to be followed by those determined to go to war. The four principles are as follows: just authority; just cause; right intention; last resort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just authority===
The criterion of just authority refers to the determined legality of going to war, has the concept of war and the pursuit of it been legally processed and justified?&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.equip.org/article/just-war-tradition/|title=Just War Tradition - Christian Research Institute|work=Christian Research Institute|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just cause===
Just cause is a justifiable reason that war is the appropriate and necessary response. If war can be avoided, that must be determined first, according to the philosophy of just war theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Right intention===
To go to war, one must determine if the intentions of doing so are right according to morality. Right intention criterion requires the determination of whether or not a war response is a measurable way to the conflict being acted upon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Last resort===
War is a last resort response, meaning that if there is a conflict between disagreeing parties, all solutions must be attempted before resorting to war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traditions of thought==
Since the philosophy of war is often treated as a subset of another branch of philosophy (for example, political philosophy or the philosophy of law) it would be difficult to define any clear-cut schools of thought in the same sense that, e.g., [[Existentialism]] or [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] can be described as distinct movements. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Carl von Clausewitz is "the only (so-called) philosopher of war", implying that he is the only (major) philosophical writer who develops a philosophical system focusing ''exclusively'' on war. However, discernible traditions of thought on war have developed over time, so that some writers have been able to distinguish broad categories (if somewhat loosely).

===Teleological categories===
[[Anatol Rapoport]]'s introduction to his edition of the [[J. J. Graham]] [[translation]] of Clausewitz's ''On War'' identifies three main teleological traditions in the philosophy of war: the cataclysmic, the [[eschatology|eschatological]], and the political. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). These are not the only possible teleological philosophies of war, but only three of the most common. As Rapoport says,

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;To put it [[metaphor]]ically, in political philosophy war is compared to a game of strategy (like [[chess]]); in eschatological philosophy, to a mission or the dénouement of a [[drama]]; in cataclysmic philosophy, to a [[fire]] or an [[epidemic]].

These do not, of course, exhaust the views of war prevailing at different times and at different places. For example, war has at times been viewed as a pastime or an [[adventure]], as the only proper occupation for a [[nobleman]], as an affair of [[honor]] (for example, the days of [[chivalry]]), as a [[ceremony]] (e.g. among the [[Aztecs]]), as an outlet of aggressive [[instinct]]s or a manifestation of a "[[Suicide|death wish]]", as [[nature]]'s way of ensuring the [[survival of the fittest]], as an [[absurdity]] (e.g. among [[Eskimos]]), as a tenacious custom, destined to die out like [[slavery]], and as a [[crime]]. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 17)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

*The '''Cataclysmic''' school of thought, which was espoused by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', sees war as a bane on humanity – whether avoidable or inevitable – which serves little purpose outside of causing destruction and suffering, and which may cause drastic change to [[society]], but not in any teleological sense. Tolstoy's view may be placed under the subcategory of global cataclysmic philosophy of war.  Another subcategory of the cataclysmic school of thought is the [[ethnocentric]] cataclysmic, in which this view is focused specifically on the plight of a specific [[ethnicity]] or [[nation]], for example the view in [[Judaism]] of war as a [[punishment]] from [[God]] on the [[Israelites]] in certain books of the [[Tanakh|Tenakh]] ([[Old Testament]]). As the Tenakh (in certain books) sees war as an ineluctable act of God, so Tolstoy especially emphasizes war as something that befalls man and is in no way under the influence of man's "[[free will]]", but is instead the result of irresistible global forces. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction 16)
*The '''Eschatological''' school of thought sees all wars (or all major wars) as leading to some goal, and asserts that some final conflict will someday resolve the path followed by all wars and result in a massive upheaval of society and a subsequent new society free from war (in varying theories the resulting society may be either a [[utopia]] or a [[dystopia]]). There are two subsets of this view: the Messianic and the Global theory. The [[Marxist]] concept of a [[communist]] world ruled by the [[proletariat]] after a final worldwide [[revolution]] is an example of the global theory, and the [[Christian]] concept of an [[Armageddon]] war which will usher in the [[second coming]] of [[Christ]] and the final defeat of [[Satan]] is an example of a theory that could fall under Global or Messianic. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) The [[messiah|messianic]] eschatological philosophy is derived from the Jewish-Christian concept of a [[Messiah]], and sees wars as culminating in unification of humanity under a single [[faith]] or a single ruler. [[Crusades]], [[Jihad]]s, the [[Nazi]] concept of a [[Master Race]] and the 19th century American concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] may also fall under this heading. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) (See main articles for more information: [[Christian eschatology]], [[Jewish eschatology]])
*The '''Political''' school of thought, of which Clausewitz was a proponent, sees war as a tool of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. On page 13 Rapoport says,

{{quote|Clausewitz views war as a rational instrument of national [[policy]]. The three words "[[Rationality|rational]]", "[[Tool|instrument]]" and "national" are the key concepts of his paradigm. In this view, the decision to wage war "ought" to be rational, in the sense that it ought to be based on estimated costs and gains of war. Next, war "ought" to be instrumental, in the sense that it ought to be waged in order to achieve some goal, never for its own sake; and also in the sense that strategy and tactics ought to be directed towards just one end, namely towards victory. Finally, war "ought" to be national, in the sense that its objective should be to advance the interests of a national state and that the entire effort of the nation ought to be mobilized in the service of the military objective.}}

:He later characterizes the philosophy behind the [[Vietnam War]] and other [[Cold War]] conflicts as "Neo-Clausewitzian". Rapoport also includes Machiavelli as an early example of the political philosophy of war (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). Decades after his essay, the [[War on Terrorism]] and the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq War]] begun by the [[United States]] under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2001 and 2003 have often been justified under the [[doctrine of preemption]], a political motivation stating that the United States must use war to prevent further attacks such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

===Ethical categories===
Another possible system for categorizing different schools of thought on war can be found in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see external links, below), based on [[ethics]]. The SEP describes three major divisions in the ethics of war: the realist, the pacifist, and the just war Theory. In a nutshell:

* '''Realists''' will typically hold that systems of [[morals]] and ethics which guide ''individuals'' within societies cannot realistically be applied to societies as a whole to govern the way they, as societies, interact with other societies. Hence, a state's purposes in war is simply to preserve its national interest. This kind of thinking is similar to Machiavelli's philosophy, and [[Thucydides]] and [[Hobbes]] may also fall under this category.
* '''[[Pacifism]]''' however, maintains that a moral evaluation of war is possible, and that war is always found to be immoral. Generally, there are two kinds of modern secular pacifism to consider: (1) a more consequentialist form of pacifism (or CP), which maintains that the benefits accruing from war can never outweigh the costs of fighting it; and (2) a more deontological form of pacifism (or DP), which contends that the very activity of war is intrinsically wrong, since it violates foremost duties of justice, such as not killing human beings. [[Eugene Victor Debs]] and others were famous advocates of pacifistic [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] methods instead of war.
* '''[[Nonviolence]]''' also holds that a moral evaluation of war is a duty, and that war is always found to be immoral. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all famous advocates of [[power of truth]], [[law]]fulness, [[soft power]], [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]] methods instead of war and to prevent war. Gandhi said he disliked more cowardice than violence.
* '''[[Just war theory]]''', along with pacifism, holds that morals do apply to war. However, unlike pacifism, according to just war theory it ''is'' possible for a war to be morally justified. The concept of a morally justified war underlies much of the concept [[International Law]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Hugo Grotius]] are among the philosophers who have espoused some form of a just war philosophy. One common just war theory evaluation of war is that war is only justified if 1.) waged in a state or nation's self-defense, or 2.) waged in order to end gross violations of [[human rights]]. Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] advocated these criteria as justification for war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2540">'''Postanalytic philosophy''' describes a detachment from the mainstream philosophical movement of [[analytic philosophy]], which is the predominant school of thought in [[English-speaking countries]]. Postanalytic philosophy derives mainly from contemporary American thought, especially from the works of philosophers [[Richard Rorty]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Stanley Cavell]]. The term is closely associated with the much broader movement of contemporary [[American pragmatism]], which, loosely defined, advocates a detachment from the definition of 'objective truth' given by modern philosophers such as Descartes. Postanalytic philosophers emphasize the contingency of human thought, [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[utility]], and [[social progress]].

==On "postanalytic philosophy"==
The term "postanalytic philosophy" itself has been used in a vaguely descriptive sense and not in the sense of a concrete philosophical movement. Many postanalytic philosophers write along an analytic vein and on traditionally analytic topics. Richard Rorty said: "I think that analytic philosophy can keep its highly professional methods, the insistence on detail and mechanics, and just drop its transcendental project. I'm not out to criticize analytic philosophy as a style. It's a good style. I think the years of superprofessionalism were beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Mendieta, ''Take Care of Freedom and Truth Will Take Care of Itself'', 2005, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty says the goal of postanalytic philosophy is not to oppose analytic philosophy or its methods, but to dispute its hope to make philosophy the penultimate form of knowledge from which every other knowledge claim must be derived. 

Postanalytic philosophy may also be known as '''post-philosophy''',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Voparil, Richard J. Bernstein, ''The Rorty Reader'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; a term used by Rorty, to emphasize the notion that the project of philosophy as conceived by Enlightenment philosophers no longer serves the role it used to in society and that this role has been replaced by other media.

'''Posthumanism''' or '''post-humanism''' (meaning "after [[humanism]]" or "beyond humanism") is a term with at least seven definitions according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando:&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2013"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ferrando | first=Francesca |title = Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations|year = 2013 |url =  http://www.existenz.us/volumes/Vol.8-2Ferrando.pdf|format=PDF| issn = 1932-1066 | accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Voluntary Human Extinction]]''', which seeks a "posthuman future" that in this case is a future ''without humans''.

==Philosophical posthumanism==
Philosopher Ted Schatzki suggests there are two varieties of posthumanism of the philosophical kind:&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"&gt;Schatzki, T.R. 2001.  Introduction: Practice theory, in ''The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory'' eds. Theodore R.Schatzki, Karin Knorr Cetina &amp; Eike Von Savigny. pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

One, which he calls 'objectivism', tries to counter the overemphasis of the subjective or intersubjective that pervades humanism, and emphasises the role of the nonhuman agents, whether they be animals and plants, or computers or other things.&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"/&gt;

A second prioritizes practices, especially social practices, over individuals (or individual subjects) which, they say, constitute the individual.&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"/&gt;

There may be a third kind of posthumanism, propounded by the philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]].  Though he did not label it as 'posthumanism', he made an extensive and penetrating immanent critique of Humanism, and then constructed a philosophy that presupposed neither Humanist, nor Scholastic, nor Greek thought but started with a different [[religious ground motive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dooy.info/ground.motives.html | title=Ground Motives - the Dooyeweerd Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd prioritized law and meaningfulness as that which enables humanity and all else to exist, behave, live, occur, etc.  "''Meaning'' is the ''being'' of all that has been ''created''," Dooyeweerd wrote, "and the nature even of our selfhood."&lt;ref name="dy-nc"&gt;
Dooyeweerd, H. (1955/1984). A new critique of theoretical thought (Vol. 1). Jordan Station, Ontario, Canada: Paideia Press. P. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Both human and nonhuman alike function subject to a common 'law-side', which is diverse, composed of a number of distinct law-spheres or ''aspects''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dooy.info/2sides.html 'law-side']&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal being of both human and non-human is multi-aspectual; for example, both plants and humans are bodies, functioning in the biotic aspect, and both computers and humans function in the formative and lingual aspect, but humans function in the aesthetic, juridical, ethical and faith aspects too.  The Dooyeweerdian version is able to incorporate and integrate both the objectivist version and the practices version, because it allows nonhuman agents their own subject-functioning in various aspects and places emphasis on aspectual functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dooy.info/subject.object.html his radical notion of subject-object relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of philosophical posthumanism==
[[Ihab Hassan]], theorist in the [[literary theory|academic study of literature]], once stated:

{{quote|Humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something one must helplessly call posthumanism.&lt;ref name="Hassan 1977"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Ihab Hassan|Hassan, Ihab]] | editor = Michel Benamou, Charles Caramello | title = Performance in Postmodern Culture | publisher = Coda Press | location = Madison, Wisconsin | year = 1977 | chapter = Prometheus as Performer: Toward a Postmodern Culture? | isbn = 978-0-930956-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view predates most currents of posthumanism which have developed over the late 20th century in somewhat diverse, but complementary, domains of thought and practice. For example, Hassan is a known scholar whose theoretical writings expressly address [[postmodernity]] in [[society]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Beyond [[postmodernist]] studies, posthumanism has been developed and deployed by various cultural theorists, often in reaction to problematic inherent assumptions within [[humanistic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] thought.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;

Theorists who both complement and contrast Hassan include [[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Cybernetics|cyberneticists]] such as [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Warren McCullouch]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Cary Wolfe]], [[Elaine Graham]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Peter Sloterdijk]], [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]], [[Evan Thompson]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Douglas Kellner]]. Among the theorists are philosophers, such as Robert Pepperell, who have written about a "[[posthuman condition]]", which is often substituted for the term "posthumanism".&lt;ref name="Badmington 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"/&gt;

Posthumanism differs from classical [[humanism]] by relegating [[human]]ity back to [[biocentrism (ethics)|one of many natural species]], thereby rejecting any claims founded on [[anthropocentric]] dominance.&lt;ref name=wolfe&gt;Wolfe, C. (2009). [https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/what-is-posthumanism ''''What is Posthumanism?''''] University of Minnesota Press. Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this claim, humans have no inherent rights to destroy [[nature]] or set themselves above it in [[ethical]] considerations ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. Human [[knowledge]] is also reduced to a less controlling position, previously seen as the defining aspect of the world. [[Human rights]] exist on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and posthuman rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds|journal=Teknokultura|volume=12|issue=2|author=[[Woody Evans|Evans, Woody]]|year=2015|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310|doi=10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations and fallibility of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] are confessed, even though it does not imply abandoning the [[rationalism|rational]] tradition of [[humanism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Proponents of a posthuman discourse, suggest that innovative advancements and emerging technologies have transcended the traditional model of the human, as proposed by [[Descartes]] among others associated with philosophy of the [[Enlightenment age|Enlightenment period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Badmington|first1=Neil|title=Posthumanism|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405183123_chunk_g978140518312363_ss1-3|publisher=Blackwell Reference Online|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[humanism]], the discourse of posthumanism seeks to redefine the boundaries surrounding modern philosophical understanding of the human. Posthumanism represents an evolution of thought beyond that of the contemporary social boundaries and is predicated on the seeking of truth within a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] context. In so doing, it rejects previous attempts to establish '[[anthropological universal]]s' that are imbued with anthropocentric assumptions.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt;

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] placed posthumanism within a context that differentiated [[humanism]] from [[Enlightenment Thought|enlightenment thought]]. According to Foucault, the two existed in a state of tension: as humanism sought to establish norms while Enlightenment thought attempted to transcend all that is material, including the boundaries that are constructed by humanistic thought.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt;  Drawing on the Enlightenment’s challenges to the boundaries of humanism, posthumanism rejects the various assumptions of human dogmas (anthropological, political, scientific) and takes the next step by attempting to change the nature of thought about what it means to be human. This requires not only decentering the human in multiple discourses (evolutionary, ecological, technological) but also examining those discourses to uncover inherent humanistic, anthropocentric, normative notions of humanness and the concept of the human.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;

==Contemporary posthuman discourse==
Posthumanistic discourse aims to open up spaces to examine what it means to be human and critically question the concept of "the human" in light of current cultural and historical contexts&lt;ref name=miah /&gt; In her book ''How We Became Posthuman'', [[N. Katherine Hayles]], writes about the struggle between different versions of the posthuman as it continually co-evolves alongside intelligent machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cecchetto|first1=David|title=Humanesis: Sound and Technological Posthumanism|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such coevolution, according to some strands of the posthuman discourse, allows one to extend their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understandings of real experiences beyond the boundaries of [[embodied cognition|embodied]]  existence. According to Hayles's view of posthuman, often referred to as technological posthumanism, [[visual perception]] and digital representations thus paradoxically become ever more salient. Even as one seeks to extend knowledge by deconstructing perceived boundaries, it is these same boundaries that make knowledge acquisition possible. The use of technology in a contemporary society is thought to complicate this relationship.

[[N. Katherine Hayles|Hayles]] discusses the translation of human bodies into information (as suggested by [[Hans Moravec]]) in order to illuminate how the boundaries of our embodied reality have been compromised in the current age and how narrow definitions of humanness no longer apply. Because of this, according to [[N. Katherine Hayles|Hayles]], posthumanism is characterized by a loss of [[subjectivity]] based on bodily boundaries.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;  This strand of posthumanism, including the changing notion of subjectivity and the disruption of ideas concerning what it means to be human, is often associated with [[Donna Haraway]]’s concept of the [[cyborg]].&lt;ref name=miah /&gt; However, [[Donna Haraway|Haraway]] has distanced herself from posthumanistic discourse due to other theorists’ use of the term to promote [[Utopianism|utopian]] views of technological innovation to extend the human biological capacity&lt;ref name=gane /&gt; (even though these notions would more correctly fall into the realm of [[transhumanism]]&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;).

While posthumanism is a broad and complex ideology, it has relevant implications today and for the future. It attempts to redefine [[social structures]] without inherently humanly or even biological origins, but rather in terms of [[social system|social]] and [[psychological]] systems where [[consciousness]] and [[communication]] could potentially exist as unique [[Incorporeality|disembodied]] entities. Questions subsequently emerge with respect to the current use and the future of technology in shaping human existence,&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt; as do new concerns with regards to [[language]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[subjectivity]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[justice]] and [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roudavski|first1=Stanislav|last2=McCormack|first2=Jon|title=Post-Anthropocentric Creativity|date=2016|journal=Digital Creativity|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–6|doi=10.1080/14626268.2016.1151442|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with transhumanism==
Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] comments that there is considerable confusion between the two terms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranisch|first1=Robert|title=Post- and Transhumanism: An Introduction|date=January 2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269405350|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacFarlane|first1=James|title=Boundary Work: Post- and Transhumanism, Part I, James Michael MacFarlane|url=https://social-epistemology.com/2014/12/23/boundary-work-post-and-transhumanism-part-i-james-michael-macfarlane/|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the introduction to their book on post- and transhumanism, Robert Ranisch and Stefan Sorgner address the source of this confusion, stating that posthumanism is often used as an umbrella term that includes both transhumanism and critical posthumanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although both subjects relate to the future of humanity, they differ in their view of [[anthropocentrism]]. Pramod Nayar, author of ''Posthumanism'', states that posthumanism has two main branches: ontological and critical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posthumanism|last=K.|first=Nayar, Pramod|isbn=9780745662404|location=Cambridge|oclc=863676564|date = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontological posthumanism is synonymous with transhumanism. The subject is regarded as “an intensification of humanism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is posthumanism?|last=Cary.|first=Wolfe|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816666157|location=Minneapolis|oclc=351313274}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism]] retains humanism’s focus on the homo sapien as the center of the world but also considers technology to be an integral aid to human progression. Critical posthumanism, however, is opposed to these views. Critical posthumanism “rejects both human exceptionalism (the idea that humans are unique creatures) and human instrumentalism (that humans have a right to control the natural world).”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These contrasting views on the importance of human beings are the main distinctions between the two subjects. 

Transhumanism is also more ingrained in popular culture than critical posthumanism, especially in science fiction. The term is referred to by Pramod Nayar as "the pop posthumanism of cinema and pop culture."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that all forms of posthumanism, including transhumanism, have more in common than their respective proponents realize.&lt;ref name="Winner 2005"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Langdon Winner|Winner, Langdon]] | editor = Harold Bailie, Timothy Casey| title = Is Human Nature Obsolete?| publisher =M.I.T. Press  | location = Massachusetts Institute of Technology, October 2004| isbn = 978-0262524285 | pages = 385–411 | chapter = Resistance is Futile: The Posthuman Condition and Its Advocates| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linking these different approaches, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] suggests that 'the key political problem is that, in effect, the position allows the human as a category of being to flow down the plughole of history':

{{cquote| 
{{quote|This is ontologically critical. Unlike the naming of ‘postmodernism’ where the ‘post’ does not infer the end of what it previously meant to be human (just the passing of the dominance of the modern) the posthumanists are playing a serious game where the human, in all its ontological variability, disappears in the name of saving something unspecified about us as merely a motley co-location of individuals and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2017 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Alternative Paradigms for Sustainability: Decentring the Human without Becoming Posthuman | title= Reimagining Sustainability in Precarious Times | editor1= Karen Malone|editor2=Son Truong|editor3=Tonia Gray | chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/32388929 | publisher= Ashgate | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

However, some posthumanists in the [[humanities]] and the [[arts]] are critical of transhumanism (the brunt of Paul James's criticism), in part, because they argue that it incorporates and extends many of the values of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment humanism]] and [[classical liberalism]], namely [[scientism]], according to [[performance art|performance]] philosopher [[Shannon Bell]]:&lt;ref name="Zaretsky 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Zaretsky, Adam|    title = Bioart in Question. Interview.|    year = 2005|    url = http://magazine.ciac.ca/archives/no_23/en/entrevue.htm|    accessdate = 2007-01-28|    deadurl = yes|    archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130115125814/http://magazine.ciac.ca/archives/no_23/en/entrevue.htm|    archivedate = 2013-01-15|    df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote| 
{{quote|[[Altruism]], [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[humanism]] are the soft and slimy [[virtues]] that underpin [[liberal capitalism]]. Humanism has always been integrated into discourses of exploitation: [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], [[neoimperialism]], [[democracy]], and of course, American democratization. One of the serious flaws in [[transhumanism]] is the importation of liberal-human values to the biotechno enhancement of the human. Posthumanism has a much stronger critical edge attempting to develop through enactment new understandings of the [[Self and Others|self and others]], [[essence]], [[consciousness]], [[intelligence]], [[reason]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[intimacy]], [[life]], [[embodied cognition|embodiment]], [[Personal identity|identity]] and the [[Human body|body]].&lt;ref name="Zaretsky 2005"/&gt;}}}}

While many modern leaders of thought are accepting of nature of ideologies described by posthumanism, some are more skeptical of the term. [[Donna Haraway]], the author of [[Cyborg Manifesto|''A Cyborg Manifesto'']], has outspokenly rejected the term, though acknowledges a philosophical alignment with posthumanism. [[Donna Haraway|Haraway]] opts instead for the term of companion species, referring to nonhuman entities with which humans coexist.&lt;ref name=gane&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gane|first1=Nicholas|title=When We Have Never Been Human, What Is to Be Done?: Interview with Donna Haraway|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|date=2006|volume=23|issue=7–8|pages=135–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of race, some argue, are suspiciously elided within the "turn" to posthumanism. Noting that the terms "post" and "human" are already loaded with racial meaning, critical theorist Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues that the impulse to move "beyond" the human within posthumanism too often ignores "praxes of humanity and critiques produced by black people",{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} including [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Aimé Césaire|Aime Cesaire]] to [[Hortense Spillers]] and [[Fred Moten]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} Interrogating the conceptual grounds in which such a mode of “beyond” is rendered legible and viable, Jackson argues that it is important to observe that ''"blackness conditions and constitutes the very nonhuman disruption and/or disruption"'' which posthumanists invite.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} In other words, given that race in general and blackness in particular constitutes the very terms through which human/nonhuman distinctions are made, for example in enduring legacies of [[scientific racism]], a gesture toward a “beyond” actually “returns us to a Eurocentric transcendentalism long challenged”.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=217}}

It is often assumed, rightly or wrongly, that language depends on mental concepts, and that certain concepts are [[innate]]. These innate concepts provide sources of very basic linguistic competency, available to any natural language speaker that enables more complex forms of language use, including philosophical, scientific, or other types of technical language. These basic concepts, in combination, may form basic propositional attitudes about things and events. Often “pre-theoretical belief” refers to these basic propositional attitudes. Also, “pre-theoretical beliefs” may refer to simple intuitions.

''Pre-theoretic belief'' is a term used in philosophical arguments for and against [[libertarianism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balaguer|first1=Mark|title=Free will as an open scientific problem excerpt: Why There Are No Good Arguments for or against Determinism (or Any Other Thesis That Would Establish or Refute Libertarianism) ...|date=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262319775|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F_FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=Pre-theoretic+belief&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0H5HcHCt6L&amp;sig=IBnSZJtjrLBWskIV63cHEJqqPr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYt67tpuTXAhUKMd8KHaZVBK4Q6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pre-theoretic%20belief&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">'''The preface paradox''', or '''the paradox of the preface''',&lt;ref&gt;Makinson, D. C., ''Paradox of the Preface'', Analysis 25 (1965) 205-207. [http://david.c.makinson.googlepages.com/MakinsonPrefaceParadox1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced by [[David Makinson]] in 1965. Similar to the [[lottery paradox]], it presents an argument according to which it can be rational to accept mutually incompatible beliefs.  While the preface paradox ''nullifies'' a claim contrary to one's belief, it is opposite to [[Moore's paradox]] which ''asserts'' a claim contrary to one's belief.

== Overview ==

The argument runs along these lines:

It is customary for authors of academic books to include in the preface of their books statements such as "any errors that remain are my sole responsibility."  Occasionally they go further and actually claim there are errors in the books, with statements such as "the errors that are found herein are mine alone." 

(1) Such an author has written a book that contains many assertions, and has factually checked each one carefully, submitted it to reviewers for comment, etc.  Thus, he has reason to believe that each assertion he has made is true. 

(2) However, he knows, having learned from experience, that, despite his best efforts, there are very likely undetected errors in his book. So he also has good reason to believe that there is at least one assertion in his book that is not true.

Thus, he has good reason, from (1), to rationally believe that each statement in his book is true, while at the same time he has good reason, from (2), to rationally believe that the book contains at least one error.  Thus he can rationally believe that the book both does and does not contain at least one error.

== Attempted solutions ==

In [[Classical logic|classical]] [[deductive logic]], a set of statements is inconsistent if it contains a contradiction. The paradox then arises from the contradiction of the author's belief that all of the statements in his book are correct (1) with his belief that at least one of them is not correct (2). To resolve the paradox, one can attack either the contradiction between statements (1) and (2), or the inconsistency of their conjunction.

Probabilistic perspective may restate the statements in other terms, thus resolving the paradox by making them non-contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, A. R., ''The Paradox of the Preface'', Philos. Sci., 53 (1986), pp. 246–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New, C., ''A Note on the Paradox of the Preface'', The Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 28 (1978), pages 341-344&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the author is 99 % sure each single statement in his book is true (1), there can still be so many statements in the book that the aggregate probability of some of them being false (2) is very high as well. Since the principles of [[rational acceptance]] allows the author to accept a very likely statement as true, he may rationally chose to believe in (1). Same principles may make him [[Rationality|rationally believe]] also in (2).

Another way to resolve the paradox is to reject the inconsistency of both (1) and (2) being true at the same time. This is done by rejecting the [[conjunction principle]], i. e. that belief (or rational belief) in various propositions entails a belief (or rational belief) in their conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John N..(1987). ''The Preface Paradox Dissolved'', Theoria, 53(2-3), 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Most philosophers intuitively believe the principle to be true, but some (e. g.  [[Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.|Kyburg]]) intuitively believe it to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Kyburg, H. E., ''Conjunctivitis'', reprinted in Epistemology and Inference, pp. 232-254. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to Kyburg's solution to the [[lottery paradox]].

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C. Becker |author2=Charlotte B.

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D.

==Formulation and detailed arguments==
{{see|Existence of God}}
The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities—omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence—then the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

===Evidential problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' and 'Evidential argument from evil' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L. Rowe|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=16|pages=336–37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe also cites the example of human evil where an innocent child is a victim of violence and thereby suffers.&lt;ref name=rowe336/&gt;]]

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=Noûs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil and animal suffering===
{{See also|Wild animal suffering}}

The problem of evil has also been extended beyond human suffering, to include suffering of animals from cruelty, disease and evil.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van Inwagen|title=The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQhUrE8BYFIC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954397-7 |pages=120, 123–26, context: 120–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this problem includes animal suffering from natural evil, such as the violence and fear faced by animals from predators, natural disasters, over the history of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as the Darwinian problem of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Murray |title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZFNf9EwSSYC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-155327-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeidap193/&gt; after Charles Darwin who expressed it as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray2008"/&gt;

{{Quote|
'the sufferings of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time' are apparently irreconcilable with the existence of a creator of 'unbounded' goodness.

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

# Necessarily, God actualized an evolutionary perfect world.
# If #1 is true then either #2 or #5 is true, but not both. This is a contradiction, so #1 is not true.

== Responses, defences and theodicies ==
Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεός (theós), "god" and δίκη (díkē), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"—showing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification—a morally or philosophically sufficient reason—for the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are—without knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55–58, 69–70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:• that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101–05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S. Feinberg |title=The Many Faces of Evil (Revised and Expanded Edition): Theological Systems and the Problems of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w_vM7DgWN4C |year=2004|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-1727-3 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a few scholars while accepting that "free will" applies in a human context, have posited an alternative "free creatures" defense, stating that animals too benefit from their physical freedom though that comes with the cost of dangers they continuously face.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering—such as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries—and it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314–39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158–168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49–52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107–26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn’t mean "were justified"; the blissful person’s disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn’t imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn’t thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M. Jorgensen and Samuel Newlands|title=New Essays on Leibniz's Theodicy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNPQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966003-2 |pages=64–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Chignell|author2=Terence Cuneo|author3=Matthew C.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371–81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response—called the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;—has been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"—profoundly hidden outweighing goods—defense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530–48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

====The Bible====
Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;

There are, essentially, four representations of evil in the Bible: chaos, human sin, Satanic/demonic forces, and suffering.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The biblical language of chaos and chaos monsters such as Leviathan remind us order and harmony in our world are constantly assailed by forces "inimical to God's good creation."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil. It remains rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

====Judgment Day====
John Joseph Haldane's Wittgenstinian-Thomistic account of concept formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haldane|first1=J.J.|title=Atheism and Theism|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23259-1|pages=102–05|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Heidegger's observation of temporality's thrown nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19770-2|pages=426–27 (H 374) 458–72 (H 406–21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; imply that God's act of creation and God's act of judgment are the same act. God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE–c. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' – Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' – Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' – The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational—i.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian André Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189–90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan. By allowing opposition and temptations in mortality, God created an environment for people to learn, to develop their freedom to choose, and to appreciate and understand the light, with a comparison to darkness &lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_27_2015c1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-4-freedom-to-choose?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 4: Freedom to Choose |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Doctrines of the Gospel, Student Manual |year= 2000 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Purpose of Earth Life |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-10-the-purpose-of-earth-life?lang=eng |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

===Islam===
Islamic scholars in the medieval and modern era have tried to reconcile the problem of evil with the afterlife theodicy.&lt;ref name="Abu-Rabi2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MeriBacharach2006p772"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayman Shihadeh | editor=Josef W.

Alternate theodicies in Islamic thought include the 11th-century Ibn Sina's denial of evil in a form similar to "privation theory" theodicy.&lt;ref name="Inati2000p171"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shams C.

===Judaism===
{{See also|Holocaust theology}}
According to Jon Levenson, the writers of Hebrew Bible were well aware of evil as a theological problem, but he does not claim awareness of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=hoffman17&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to Yair Hoffman, the ancient books of the Hebrew Bible do not show an awareness of the theological problem of evil, and even most later biblical scholars did not touch the question of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |pages=16–18|quote=... nowhere in this book is there a comprehensive concept of evil as such, let alone awareness of a theological problem of evil. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest awareness of the problem of evil in Judaism tradition is evidenced in extra- and post-biblical sources such as early [[Apocrypha]] (secret texts by unknown authors, which were not considered mainstream at the time they were written).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first systematic reflections on the problem of evil by Jewish philosophers is traceable only in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil gained renewed interest among Jewish scholars after the moral evil of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The all-powerful, all-compassionate, all-knowing monotheistic God presumably had the power to prevent the Holocaust, but he didn't.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Jewish thinkers have argued that either God did not care about the torture and suffering in the world He created—which means He is not omnibenevolent, or He did not know what was happening—which means He is not omniscient.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel|title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=314–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution of Jewish people was not a new phenomenon, and medieval Jewish thinkers had in abstract attempted to reconcile the logical version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Holocaust experience and other episodes of mass extermination such as the [[Gulag]] and the [[Killing Fields]] where millions of people experienced torture and died, however, brought into focus the visceral nature of the evidential version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=219–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th-century Rabbi called [[Saadia Gaon]] presented a theodicy along the lines of "soul-making, greater good and afterlife".&lt;ref name=langekandel32&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=315–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering suggested Saadia, in a manner similar to [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Berakhot 5'', should be considered as a gift from God because it leads to an eternity of heaven in afterlife.&lt;ref name=langekandel33&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Rynhold| editor=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange and Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=315–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the 12th-century [[Moses Maimonides]] offered a different theodicy, asserting that the all-loving God neither produces evil nor gifts suffering, because everything God does is absolutely good, then presenting the "privation theory" explanation.&lt;ref name=langekandel32/&gt; Both these answers, states Daniel Rynhold, merely rationalize and suppress the problem of evil, rather than solve it.&lt;ref name=langekandel33/&gt; It is easier to rationalize suffering caused by a theft or accidental injuries, but the physical, mental and existential horrors of persistent events of repeated violence over long periods of time such as Holocaust, or an innocent child slowly suffering from the pain of cancer, cannot be rationalized by one sided self blame and belittling a personhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=314–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts by theologians to reconcile the problem of evil, with claims that the Holocaust evil was a necessary, intentional and purposeful act of God have been declared obscene by Jewish thinkers such as Richard Rubenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Rynhold| editor=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange and Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |page=317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain.

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pp. 177–79&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}} Madhvacharya was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic ''Tattvavada'' theory that proposed God and living beings along with universe as separate realities. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=270, 370–71, ''Quote:'' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

===Epicurus===
[[Epicurus]] is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called the "[[Epicurean paradox]]", the "riddle of Epicurus", or the "Epicurus' [[trilemma]]":

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of good===
Several philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327264] Cahn, Stephen M. (1977). Cacodaemony. Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7247672&amp;jid=RES&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=7247664&amp;fromPage=cupadmin&amp;pdftype=6316268&amp;repository=authInst]  Law, Stephen (2010). The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353–73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, François {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

The '''Society for Women in Philosophy''' was created in 1972 to support and promote women in philosophy. Since that time the Society for Women in Philosophy or "SWIP" has expanded to many branches around the world, including in the US, Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Flanders, and Germany. SWIP organizations worldwide hold meetings and lectures that aim to support women in philosophy; some, such as SWIPshop, focus exclusively on feminist philosophy, while others, such as SWIP-Analytic, focus on women philosophers working in other areas.&lt;ref name="uh.edu"&gt;SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swipanalytic.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/ About - SWIP-Analytic Workshop Series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyswip.tumblr.com/ New York Society for Women in Philosophy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founding members of the Society for Women in Philosophy was [[Alison Jaggar]], who was also one of the first people to introduce feminist concerns into philosophy.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSautels|first=Peggy|title=Alison Jaggar: April 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/alisonjaggarapril2013|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, one philosopher is named the Distinguished Woman Philosopher of the Year by the Society for Women in Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

Some SWIP archive records were originally housed in the Sophia Smith Collection at the [[Smith College]] library (started in 1982 by Kathy Pyne Parsons Addelson following the 10th anniversary of SWIP). The official SWIP Archive will now be permanently housed in the Feminist Theory Archive, Pembroke Center, [[Brown University]]. The new SWIP home is the product of the efforts of the Feminist Philosophy Archive Project created in June 2013 and ending in July 2014. The main goal of the FPA Project team, composed of philosophers Joan Callahan, Ann Garry, Alison Jaggar, Sandra Harding, Christina Rawls, and Samantha Noll, was to locate and organize the best possible professional archive for over four decades of SWIP records to be preserved. As of December 2014, the American Philosophical Association awarded the Feminist Theory Archive, SWIP, and the FPAP organizing team financial assistance to aid in the processing and preservation of SWIP materials donated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SWIP Donor Information | url = http://www.brown.edu/research/pembroke-center/archives/feminist-theory-archives/swip-donor-information | publisher = [[Brown University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

In the 1980s, while a graduate student at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], Mary Ellen Waithe, now professor of philosophy and interim director of Women's Studies at [[Cleveland State University]], "came upon a reference to a work by Aegidius Menagius, Historia Mullierum Philosopharum, published in 1690 and 1692. [Waithe] had never heard of any women philosophers prior to the 20th century with the exceptions of Queen Christina of Sweden, known as Descartes' student, and Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in the 12th century." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;A History of Women Philosophers: Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. - 500 A.D. https://www.amazon.com/History-Women-Philosophers-Ancient-B-C/dp/9024733685&lt;/ref&gt; After she obtained a copy of this book, she discovered that "many of the women [Menagius] listed as philosophers were astronomers, astrologers, gynecologists, or simply relatives of male philosophers. Nevertheless, the list of women alleged to have been philosophers was impressive." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; At this point, she decided to "create a team of experts to collaborate with...I placed a notice in the SWIP (Society for Women in Philosophy) Newsletter and received a half-dozen responses from philosophers".&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; This collaborative project led to the publication of the four-volume ''A History of Women Philosophers'', published 1987-1995, which includes the following sections:

* Volume 1, ''Ancient Women Philosophers'' (1987) 600 BC-500 AD, Aspasia of Miletus, Diotima of Mantinea, Julia Domna, Makrina, and Hypatia of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;

At the 2002 conference for Canadian Society for Women in Philosophy, Dr. [[Nancy Tuana]] asserted the evolutionary theory that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction and therefore it has been "historically ignored," mainly because of "a fear of pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane.

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93).

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy?

McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias against women in philosophy...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ Gendered Conference Campaign " Feminist Philosophers].

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Tullia d'Aragona]] (c. 1510-1556)
*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

[[File:FullerDaguerreotype.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The only known [[daguerreotype]] of [[Margaret Fuller]] (by [[John Plumbe]], 1846).]]
*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;
     "Biography of Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, 1834&amp;ndash;1919" ([[Article (publishing)|article]]),

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
