[[File:Boulier1.JPG|right|thumb|A Chinese abacus, ''[[Suanpan]]'']]
[[File:Houghton Typ 520.03.736 - Margarita philosophica.jpg|right|thumb|''Calculating-Table'' by [[Gregor Reisch]]: ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1503. The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]). There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref name=Boyer253&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''abacus''' (''plural'' '''abaci''' or '''abacuses'''), also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Boyer253/&gt; The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abacuses are often constructed as a [[bamboo]] frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abacuses come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach [[arithmetic]], although they remain popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese [[soroban]], have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating [[Square root|square roots]]. Some of these methods may work with non-[[Natural number|natural]] numbers (numbers such as {{Math|1.5}} and {{Math|{{Frac|3|4}}}}).

Although today many use [[Calculator|calculators]] and [[Computer|computers]] instead of abacuses to calculate, abacuses still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Africa]] use abacuses, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children.&lt;ref name="Boyer253" /&gt; Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.

==Etymology==
The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄβαξ ''abax'' which means something without base, and improperly, any piece of rectangular board or plank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Stefani|1909|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaisford|1962|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasserre|Livadaras|1976|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alternatively, without reference to ancient texts on etymology, it has been suggested that it means "a square tablet strewn with dust",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1966|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "drawing-board covered with dust (for the use of mathematics)"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onions|Friedrichsen|Burchfield|1967|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the Greek word, ἄβακoς ''abakos''). Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular, there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven.&lt;ref name=pull17&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Both C. J. Gadd, a keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the [[British Museum]], and [[Jacob Levy]], a Jewish Historian who wrote ''Neuhebräisches und chaldäisches wörterbuch über die Talmudim und Midraschim [Neuhebräisches and Chaldean dictionary on the Talmuds and Midrashi]'' disagree with the "dust table" theory.&lt;ref name=pull17/&gt;}} Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a [[Northwest Semitic]], perhaps [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], word akin to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʾābāq'' (אבק), "dust" (or in post-Biblical sense meaning "sand used as a writing surface").&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{harvnb|Huehnergard|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref name = SOED&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref name = SOED/&gt; (hard "c") in use. The user of an abacus is called an ''abacist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gove|1976|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mesopotamian===
The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point to a character from the [[Babylon]]ian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crump|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Old Babylonian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melville|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians "may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carruccio|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered.&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1958|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian===
During the [[Achaemenid Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Sassanian]] and [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to have been exported to other countries.

=== Greek ===

The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Demosthenes]] (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head.&lt;ref name=Will/&gt;&lt;ref name=pull&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A play by [[Alexis (poet)|Alexis]] from the 4th century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and [[Polybius]] mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an abacus.&lt;ref name=pull/&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD (the [[Salamis Tablet]]), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from this time frame the ''Darius Vase'' was unearthed in 1851. It was covered with pictures including a "treasurer" holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other.&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;

The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese abacus, known as the ''[[suanpan]]'' (算盤, lit. "calculating tray"), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam; beads moved toward the beam are counted, while those moved away from it are not.&lt;ref name="ryerson"&gt;{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''suanpan'' can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

''Suanpan'' can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297), a ''suanpan'' is clearly visible beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard ''suanpan'' has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the ''suanpan'' is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

===Roman===
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]
The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2010|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman "ounces" (i.e. fractions).

===Indian===
The decimal number system invented in India replaced the abacus in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="UniOfNthC1"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and "Arabic" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=2004-07-04|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Abhidharmakośabhāṣya]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher [[Vasumitra]] said that "placing a wick (Sanskrit ''vartikā'') on the number one (''ekāṅka'') means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand".  It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Körner|1996|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''śūnya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mollin|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
{{Main|Soroban}}
[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]
In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. "Counting tray"), imported from China in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Gul&gt;{{harvnb|Gullberg|1997|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started, as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean===
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thocp"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jami|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American===
[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Inca]] [[quipu]]]]
[[File:Yupana 1.png|thumb|A [[yupana]] as used by the Incas.]]
Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Aztec]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanyal|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Nepōhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin|}} comes from [[Nahuatl]] and it is formed by the roots; ''Ne'' – personal -; ''pōhual'' or ''pōhualli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈpoːwalːi|}} – the account -; and ''tzintzin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡sint͡sin|}} – small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the [[Calmecac]] to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.

The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, "Arithmetic in Maya", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.

The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albree|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for "counting tool"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aimi|De Pasquale|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnett|Ryan|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hudgins|2004|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leushina|1991|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trogeman|Ernst|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flegg|1983|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and the [[Armenians|Armenian]] people also used abacuses similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a ''coulba'' by the Turks and a ''choreb'' by the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School abacus==
[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Early 20th century abacus used in Danish elementary school.]]
[[File:Telraam.JPG|thumb|A twenty bead ''rekenrek'']]
Around the world, abacuses have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].

In Western countries, a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, the gap between the 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.

The red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons. The twenty bead version, referred to by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name ''rekenrek'' ("calculating frame"), is often used, sometimes on a string of beads, sometimes on a rigid framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2011|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological Analysis ==
By learning how to calculate with abacus, one can improve his mental calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing large number calculations. [[Mental abacus|Abacus‐based mental calculation]] (AMC) was derived from the abacus which means doing calculation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in mind with an imaged abacus. It is a high-level cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective algorithm. People doing long-term AMC training shows higher numerical memory capacity and has more effectively connected neural pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Yuzheng|last2=Geng|first2=Fengji|last3=Tao|first3=Lixia|last4=Hu|first4=Nantu|last5=Du|first5=Fenglei|last6=Fu|first6=Kuang|last7=Chen|first7=Feiyan|date=2010-12-14|title=Enhanced white matter tracts integrity in children with abacus training|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.20996|journal=Human Brain Mapping|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=10–21|doi=10.1002/hbm.20996|issn=1065-9471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tung-Hsin|last2=Chen|first2=Chia-Lin|last3=Huang|first3=Yung-Hui|last4=Liu|first4=Ren-Shyan|last5=Hsieh|first5=Jen-Chuen|last6=Lee|first6=Jason J.

==Uses by the blind==
An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]].&lt;ref name="aph"&gt;{{harvnb|Terlau|Gissoni|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.{{POV inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Presley|D'Andrea|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and [[long division]] problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.&lt;ref name="aph" /&gt;

==Binary abacus==
[[File:Bbinary Abacus 002.jpg|150px|thumb|Two binary abacuses constructed by Dr. Robert C. Good, Jr., made from two Chinese abaci]]
The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Good Jr.|1985|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a [[binary number |binary system]] on a computer, or via [[ASCII]]. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an "on" or "off" position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">In [[mathematics]], the phrases '''arbitrarily large''', '''arbitrarily small''', and '''arbitrarily long''' are used in statements such as:

: "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''."

which is shorthand for:

: "For every real number ''n'', &amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for some values of ''x'' greater than ''n''."

"Arbitrarily large" is not equivalent to "[[sufficiently large]]". For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large since there are an [[Euclid's theorem|infinite number]] of them, it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. "Arbitrarily large" does not mean "[[infinitely large]]" because although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime does not exist since all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ Infinitely Large vs. Arbitratily Large.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222215520/http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ |date=2012-02-22 }} Accessed 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, phrases such as "P(''x'') is true for arbitrarily large ''x''" are used primarily for emphasis, as in "P(''x'') is true for all ''x'', no matter how large ''x'' is."  In these cases, the phrase "arbitrarily large" does not have the meaning indicated above but is in fact logically synonymous with "all."

To say that there are "arbitrarily long [[primes in arithmetic progressions|arithmetic progressions of prime numbers]]" does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense "arbitrarily long", but rather that no matter how large a number ''n'' is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html 4 Arbitrarily Large Data.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222213518/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html |date=February 22, 2012 }} Accessed 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''." could be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } \exists x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } x &gt; n \land f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using "sufficiently large" instead yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } x &gt; n \Rightarrow f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[functional analysis]] and [[order theory]], a '''Banach lattice''' &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riesz space]] with a norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space and for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; the implication &lt;math&gt;|x| \le |y| \Rightarrow \|x\| \le \|y\|&lt;/math&gt; holds, where as usual &lt;math&gt;|x| := x \vee -x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples and constructions ==

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, together with its absolute value as a norm, is a Banach lattice.
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; a Banach lattice and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt; the space of bounded, continuous functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty := \sup_{x \in X} \|f(x)\|_Y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a Banach lattice with the pointwise order &lt;math&gt;f \le g :\Leftrightarrow \forall x \in X: f(x) \le g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="627">'''Bounded growth''' occurs when the growth rate of a mathematical function is constantly increasing at a decreasing rate. Asymptotically, bounded growth approaches a fixed value.
This contrasts with [[exponential growth]], which is constantly increasing at an accelerating rate, and therefore approaches infinity in the limit.

An example of bounded growth is the [[logistic function]].

[[File:Anagram canonical svg.svg|thumb|Algorithmic [[anagram]] test using [[multiset]]s as canonical forms: The strings "&lt;tt&gt;madam curie&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;radium came&lt;/tt&gt;" are given as [[C (programming language)|C]] arrays. Each one is converted into a canonical form by sorting. Since both sorted strings literally agree, the original strings were anagrams of each other.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''canonical''', '''normal''', or '''standard'''  '''form''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a standard way of presenting that object as a [[mathematical expression]]. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a ''unique'' representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

More generally, for a class of objects on which an [[equivalence relation]] is defined, a '''canonical form''' consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[Jordan normal form]] is a canonical form for [[matrix similarity]], and the [[row echelon form]] is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an [[invertible matrix]].

In computer science, and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a '''canonical form''' is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, ''normal form'' is a weaker notion: A '''normal form''' is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

'''Canonical form''' can also mean a [[differential form]] that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its '''canonical form'''.  Putting something into canonical form is [[canonicalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have some set ''S'' of objects, with an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''. A '''canonical form''' is given by designating some objects of ''S'' to be "in canonical form", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in ''S'' represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.
A canonical form thus provides a [[classification theorem]] and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation ''R'' on a set ''S'' is a mapping ''c'':''S''→''S'' such that for all ''s'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'':
# ''c''(''s'') = ''c''(''c''(''s'')) &amp;nbsp; ([[idempotence]]),
# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; (decisiveness), and 
# ''s'' ''R'' ''c''(''s'') &amp;nbsp; (representativeness). 
Property 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object ''s'' in ''S'' to its canonical form ''s''*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.

For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 30 than ''x'' + 30 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of [[Jordan canonical form]] for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==Examples==
Note: in this section, "[[up to]]" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

*The equation of a line: ''Ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''By''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C'', with  ''A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0
*The equation of a circle: &lt;math&gt;(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, there are alternative forms for writing equations. For example, the equation of a line may be written as a [[linear equation]] in point-slope and slope-intercept form.

[[Convex polyhedra]] can be put into [[Midsphere#Canonical_polyhedron|canonical form]] such that:
* All faces are flat,
* All edges are tangent to the unit sphere, and
* The centroid of the polyhedron is at the origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lectures on Polytopes|authorlink=Günter M. Ziegler|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|year=1995|isbn=0-387-94365-X|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=152|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical notation ===

Standard form is used by many mathematicians and scientists to write extremely [[large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|large numbers]] in a more concise and understandable way.

=== Set theory ===
* [[Cantor normal form#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] of an [[ordinal number]]

=== Game theory ===
* [[Normal form game]]

=== Proof theory ===
* [[Normal form (natural deduction)]]

===Rewriting systems===
{{main|Normal form (abstract rewriting)}}
* In an [[abstract rewriting system]] a normal form is an irreducible object.

=== Lambda calculus===
* A lambda term is in [[beta normal form]] if no beta reduction is possible; [[lambda calculus]] is a particular case of an abstract rewriting system. In the untyped lambda calculus, e.g., the term &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(x x) \; \lambda x.(x x))&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

=== Dynamical systems ===
* [[Normal form (dynamical systems)]]

===Graph theory===
{{main article|Graph canonization}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Differential forms===
Canonical [[differential form]]s include the [[canonical one-form]] and [[canonical symplectic form]], important in the study of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[symplectic manifold]]s.

=== Computing ===
In [[computing]], the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called ''data normalization''.

For instance, [[database normalization]] is the process of organizing the [[Field (computer science)|fields]] and [[Table (database)|table]]s of a [[relational database]] to minimize [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] and dependency. 

In the field of [[software security]], a common [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] is unchecked [[malicious input]]. The mitigation for this problem is proper [[input validation]]. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML encoding]]) and reducing the input data to a single common [[character set]].

Other forms of data, typically associated with [[signal processing]] (including [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|imaging]]) or [[machine learning]], can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25339">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Christoffel symbols''' are an array of numbers describing a [[metric connection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{harv|Spivak|1999}} and {{harv|Choquet-Bruhat|DeWitt-Morette|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The metric connection is a specialization of the [[affine connection]] to [[surface (topology)|surface]]s or other [[manifold]]s endowed with a [[metric tensor|metric]], allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In [[differential geometry]], an affine connection can be defined without any reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: [[parallel transport]], [[covariant derivative]]s, [[geodesic]]s, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Adler, Maurice Bazin, Menahem Schiffer, ''Introduction to General Relativity'' (1965) McGraw-Hill Book Company {{ISBN|0-07-000423-4}} (''See section 2.1'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, John Archibald Wheeler, ''Gravitation'' (1973) W. H,. Freeman {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}} (''See chapters 8-11'')&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the "shape" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the [[tangent space]] is attached to the [[cotangent space]] by the [[metric tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''op. cit.'' (''See chapter 13'')&lt;/ref&gt; Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated ([[orthonormal]]) [[frame bundle]], with each "[[vierbein|frame]]" being a possible choice of a [[coordinate frame]]. An invariant metric implies that the [[structure group]] of the frame bundle is the [[orthogonal group]] {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}}. As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Jost, ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', (2002) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-42627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bleeker, ''Gauge Theory and Variational Principles'' (1991) Addison-Wesely Publishing Company {{ISBN|0-201-10096-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)[[Riemannian geometry]] in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.

In general, there are an infinite number of metric connections for a given [[metric tensor]]; however, there is one, unique connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], that is free of any [[torsion tensor|torsion]]. It is very common in physics and [[general relativity]] to work almost exclusively with the Levi-Civita connection, by working in [[coordinate frame]]s (called [[Holonomic basis|holonomic coordinates]]) where the torsion vanishes. For example, in [[Euclidean spaces]], the Christoffel symbols describe how the [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant_and_contravariant_bases| local coordinate bases]] change from point to point.

At each point of the underlying {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold, for any local coordinate system around that point, the Christoffel symbols are denoted {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Each entry of this {{math|''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}} [[Matrix (mathematics)|array]] is a [[real number]]. Under ''linear'' [[coordinate transformations]] on the manifold, the Christoffel symbols transform like the components of a [[tensor]], but under general coordinate transformations ([[diffeomorphism]]s) they do not.  Most of the algebraic properties of the Christoffel symbols follow from their relationship to the affine connection; only a few follow from the fact that the [[structure group]] is the orthogonal group {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}} (or the [[Lorentz group]] {{math|SO(3,1)}} for general relativity).

Christoffel symbols are used for performing practical calculations. For example, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] can be expressed entirely in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first [[partial derivative]]s. In [[general relativity]], the connection plays the role of the gravitational force field with the corresponding gravitational potential being the metric tensor. When the coordinate system and the metric tensor share some symmetry, many of the {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[0 (number)|zero]].

The Christoffel symbols are named for [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] (1829–1900).&lt;ref name="christoffel" &gt;{{citation|title=Ueber die Transformation der homogenen Differentialausdrücke zweiten Grades|last=Christoffel|first=E.B.|author-link=Elwin Bruno Christoffel|journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|volume=70|pages=46–70|year=1869|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002153882&amp;IDDOC=266356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note&lt;!--'Connection coefficient' and 'Connection coefficients' and redirect here--&gt;==
The definitions given below are valid for both [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s, such as those of [[general relativity]], with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contra-variant and co-variant]] indices). The formulas hold for either [[sign convention]], unless otherwise noted.

[[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used in this article, with vectors indicated by bold font. The '''connection coefficients'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] (or pseudo-Riemannian connection) expressed in a coordinate basis are called ''Christoffel symbols''.

==Preliminary definitions==
Given a [[coordinate system]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-manifold {{math|''M''}}, the [[tangent space|tangent vectors]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i = \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial x^i}=\partial_i \mathbf{x}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position vector, define what is referred to as the local [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of the tangent space to {{math|''M''}} at each point of its domain. These can be used to define the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

and its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}=\left( g_{ij} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which can in turn be used to define the dual basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i = \mathbf{e}_j g^{ji}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition in Euclidean space==
In [[Euclidean space]], the general definition given below for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind can be proven to be equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{k}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot g^{km} \mathbf{e}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Christoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via [[Ricci_calculus#Raising_and_lowering_indices|index juggling]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}
=   \Gamma^m_{ij}g_{mk}
=  \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{m} g_{mk}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, we see that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j}=\Gamma^k{}_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{k} =\Gamma{}_{kij} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;

In words, the arrays represented by the Christoffel symbols track how the basis changes from point to point. Symbols of the second kind decompose the change with respect to the basis, while symbols of the first kind decompose it with respect to the dual basis. These expressions fail as definitions when such decompositions are not possible - in particular, when the direction of change does not lie in the tangent space, which can occur on a [[curvature | curved]] surface. In this form, it easy to see the symmetry of the lower or last two indices:

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}=\Gamma^k{}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}=\Gamma_{kji} &lt;/math&gt;,

from the definition of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt; and the fact that partial derivatives commute (as long as the manifold and coordinate system [[Symmetry_of_second_derivatives| are well behaved]]).

The same numerical values for Christoffel symbols of the second kind also relate to derivatives of the dual basis, as seen in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}=- \Gamma^i_{jk} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;,

which we can rearrange as:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{jk} =- \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}  \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== General definition==
===Christoffel symbols of the first kind===
The Christoffel symbols of the first kind can be derived either from the Christoffel symbols of the second kind and the metric,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen"&gt;{{citation |last1=Ludvigsen |first1=Malcolm|title=General Relativity: A Geometrical Approach | year=1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = g_{cd} \Gamma^{d}{}_{ab}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
or from the metric alone,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab}
=\tfrac12 \left(\frac{\partial g_{ca}}{\partial x^b} + \frac{\partial g_{cb}}{\partial x^a} - \frac{\partial g_{ab}}{\partial x^c} \right)
= \tfrac12\, (g_{ca, b} + g_{cb, a} - g_{ab, c}) 
= \tfrac12\, \left(\partial_{b}g_{ca} + \partial_{a}g_{cb} - \partial_{c}g_{ab}\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

As an alternative notation one also finds&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjeep114"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=U. |last1=Chatterjee
 |first2=N. |last2=Chatterjee
 |year=2010
 |title=Vector and Tensor Analysis
 |page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dirkstruik"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=D.J. |last1=Struik
 |title=Lectures on Classical Differential Geometry
 |edition=first published in 1988 Dover
 |year=1961
 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = [ab, c].&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {{math|[''ab'', ''c''] {{=}} [''ba'', ''c'']}}.&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" &gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds| year=1968|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christoffel symbols of the second kind (symmetric definition)===
The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are the connection coefficients—in a coordinate basis—of the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and since this connection has zero [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then in this basis the connection coefficients are symmetric, i.e., {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} {{=}} Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ji''}}}}.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=U. |last1=Chatterjee
 |first2=N. |last2= Chatterjee
 |title=Vector &amp; Tensor Analysis
 |year=2010
 |page=480
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a torsion-free connection is often called ''symmetric''.

In other words, the Christoffel symbols of the second kind&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
{{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}}} or {{math|&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;}})&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt; are defined as the unique coefficients such that the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \mathrm{e}_j = \Gamma^k{}_{ij}\mathrm{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;
holds, where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on {{math|''M''}} taken in the coordinate direction {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (i.e., {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ∇&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and where {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a local coordinate ([[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) [[basis of a vector space|basis]].

The Christoffel symbols can be derived from the vanishing of the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[metric tensor]] {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
  0 = \nabla_l g_{ik}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - g_{mk}\Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im}\Gamma^m{}_{kl}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - 2g_{m(k}\Gamma^m{}_{i)l}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a shorthand notation, the [[nabla symbol]] and the partial derivative symbols are frequently dropped, and instead a [[semicolon]] and a [[comma]] are used to set off the index that is being used for the derivative.  Thus, the above is sometimes written as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \,g_{ik;l} = g_{ik,l} - g_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl} .&lt;/math&gt;

Using that the symbols are symmetric in the lower two indices, one can solve explicitly for the Christoffel symbols as a function of the metric tensor by permuting the indices and resumming:&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left(\frac{\partial g_{mk}}{\partial x^l} + \frac{\partial g_{ml}}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial g_{kl}}{\partial x^m} \right) = \tfrac12g^{im} (g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m}),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|(''g&lt;sup&gt;jk&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} is the inverse of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|(''g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, defined as (using the [[Kronecker delta]], and [[Einstein notation]] for summation) {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ji&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Although the Christoffel symbols are written in the same notation as [[Classical treatment of tensors|tensors with index notation]], they are '''not''' [[tensor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  {{harv|Kreyszig|1991}}, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;
since they [[#Change of variable|do not transform like tensors under a change of coordinates]].

===Connection coefficients in a nonholonomic basis===
The Christoffel symbols are most typically defined in a coordinate basis, which is the convention followed here. In other words,  the name '''Christoffel symbols''' is reserved only for coordinate (i.e., [[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) frames. However, the connection coefficients can also be defined in an arbitrary (i.e., nonholonomic) basis of tangent vectors {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{u}_i}\mathbf{u}_j = \omega^k{}_{ij}\mathbf{u}_k.&lt;/math&gt;
Explicitly, in terms of the metric tensor, this is&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind"&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChristoffelSymboloftheSecondKind.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left( g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m} + c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;klm&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''g&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the [[Commutator (ring theory)|commutation coefficients]] of the basis; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{u}_k,\mathbf{u}_l] = c_{kl}{}^m \mathbf{u}_m&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the basis [[vector space|vector]]s and {{math|[ , ]}} is the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]]. The standard unit vectors in [[vector fields in cylindrical and spherical coordinates|spherical and cylindrical coordinates]] furnish an example of a basis with non-vanishing commutation coefficients. The difference between the connection in such a frame, and the Levi-Civita connection is known as the [[contorsion tensor]].

===Ricci rotation coefficients (asymmetric definition)===
When we choose the basis {{math|'''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} orthonormal: {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ⟨''X&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} then {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}. This implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12\eta^{im} \left( c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the connection coefficients become antisymmetric in the first two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = - \omega_{bac}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = \eta_{ad}\omega^d{}_{bc}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the connection coefficients {{math|''ω&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are called the '''Ricci rotation coefficients'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dei sistemi di congruenze ortogonali in una varietà qualunque|author=G. Ricci-Curbastro|journal=Mem. Acc. Lincei |volume=2|year=1896|pages=276–322|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ricci's coefficients of rotation|author=H. Levy|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=31|year=1925|pages=142–145|issue=3-4|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183486405|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1925-03996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently, one can define Ricci rotation coefficients as follows:&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^k{}_{ij} := {{\mathbf{u}}}^k \cdot \left( \nabla_j {{\mathbf{u}}}_i \right)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an orthonormal nonholonomic basis and {{math|'''u'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''η&lt;sup&gt;kl&lt;/sup&gt;'''''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;}} its ''co-basis''.

==Relationship to index-free notation==
Let {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} be [[vector fields]] with components {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and {{math|''Y&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. Then the {{math|''k''}}th component of the covariant derivative of {{math|''Y''}} with respect to {{math|''X''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_X Y\right)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k = X^i \left(\frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma^k{}_{im} Y^m\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Einstein notation]] is used, so repeated indices indicate summation over indices and contraction with the metric tensor serves to raise and lower indices:
:&lt;math&gt;g(X,Y) = X^i Y_i = g_{ik}X^i Y^k = g^{ik}X_i Y_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Keep in mind that {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and that {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the [[Kronecker delta]]. The convention is that the metric tensor is the one with the lower indices; the correct way to obtain {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} from {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is to solve the linear equations {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The statement that the connection is [[torsion tensor|torsion]]-free, namely that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X,Y]&lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to the statement that—in a coordinate basis—the Christoffel symbol is symmetric in the lower two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{jk}=\Gamma^i{}_{kj}.&lt;/math&gt;

The index-less transformation properties of a tensor are given by [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullbacks]] for covariant indices, and [[pushforward (differential)|pushforwards]] for contravariant indices. The article on [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|covariant derivatives]] provides additional discussion of the correspondence between index-free notation and indexed notation.

==Covariant derivatives of tensors==
The [[covariant derivative]] of a vector field {{math|''V&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l V^m = \frac{\partial V^m}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^m{}_{kl} V^k.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant derivative of a scalar field {{math|''φ''}} is just
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \varphi = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;

and the covariant derivative of a [[covector]] field {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l \omega_m = \frac{\partial \omega_m}{\partial x^l} - \Gamma^k{}_{m l} \omega_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetry of the Christoffel symbol now implies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i\nabla_j \varphi = \nabla_j\nabla_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for any scalar field, but in general the covariant derivatives of higher order tensor fields do not commute (see [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]]).

The covariant derivative of a type (2,0) [[tensor]] field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l A^{ik}=\frac{\partial A^{ik}}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^i{}_{ml} A^{mk} + \Gamma^k{}_{ml} A^{im}, &lt;/math&gt;

that is,
:&lt;math&gt; A^{ik} {}_{;l} = A^{ik} {}_{,l} + A^{mk} \Gamma^i{}_{ml} + A^{im} \Gamma^k{}_{ml}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the tensor field is [[mixed tensor|mixed]] then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A^i {}_{k;l} = A^i {}_{k,l} + A^{m} {}_k \Gamma^i{}_{ml} - A^i {}_m \Gamma^m{}_{kl}, &lt;/math&gt;

and if the tensor field is of type {{math|(0,2)}} then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A_{ik;l} = A_{ik,l} - A_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - A_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Contravariant derivatives of tensors===
To find the contravariant derivative of a vector field, we must first transform 
it into a covariant derivative using the metric tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^l V^m = g^{il} \nabla_i V^m= g^{il} \partial_i V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k=\partial^l V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k&lt;/math&gt;

==Change of variable==
Under a change of variable from {{math|(''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} to {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, vectors transform as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}&lt;/math&gt;

and so
:&lt;math&gt;{\bar\Gamma}^k{}_{ij} =
\frac{\partial x^p}{\partial y^i}\,
\frac{\partial x^q}{\partial y^j}\,
\Gamma^r{}_{pq}\,
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^r}
+ 
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^m}\, 
\frac{\partial^2 x^m}{\partial y^i \partial y^j}  
&lt;/math&gt;

where the overline denotes the Christoffel symbols in the {{math|''y''}} coordinate system.  Note that the Christoffel symbol does '''not''' transform as a tensor, but rather as an object in the [[jet bundle]]. More precisely, the Christoffel symbols can be considered as functions on the jet bundle of the frame bundle of {{math|''M''}}, independent of any local coordinate system. Choosing a local coordinate system determines a local section of this bundle, which can then be used to pull back the Christoffel symbols to functions on {{math|''M''}}, though of course these functions then depend on the choice of local coordinate system.

At each point, there exist coordinate systems in which the Christoffel symbols vanish at the point.&lt;ref&gt;This is assuming that the connection is symmetric (e.g., the Levi-Civita connection).  If the connection has [[torsion tensor|torsion]], then only the symmetric part of the Christoffel symbol can be made to vanish.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are called (geodesic) [[normal coordinates]], and are often used in [[Riemannian geometry]].

==Applications to general relativity==
The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where [[spacetime]] is represented by a curved 4-dimensional [[Lorentz manifold]] with a [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Einstein field equations]]—which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter—contain the [[Ricci tensor]], and so calculating the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by solving the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equations]] in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">In [[mathematics]], the method of '''clearing denominators''', also called '''clearing fractions''', is a technique for simplifying an [[equation]] equating two expressions that each are a sum of [[Rational function|rational expression]]s – which includes simple [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s.

== Example ==

Consider the equation

: &lt;math&gt; \frac x 6 + \frac y {15z} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[least common multiple|smallest common multiple]] of the two denominators 6 and 15''z'' is 30''z'', so one multiplies both sides by 30''z'':

: &lt;math&gt; 5xz + 2y = 30z. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The result is an equation with no fractions.

The simplified equation is not entirely equivalent to the original. For when we substitute {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}} in the last equation, both sides simplify to 0, so we get {{nowrap|1=0 = 0}}, a mathematical truth. But the same substitution applied to the original equation results in {{nowrap|1=''x''/6 + 0/0 = 1}}, which is [[division by zero|mathematically meaningless]].

== Description ==
[[Without loss of generality]], we may assume that the [[right-hand side]] of the equation is 0, since an equation {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} may equivalently be rewritten in the form {{nowrap|1={{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − {{mvar|E}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}.

So let the equation have the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to determine a common denominator {{mvar|D}} of these fractions – preferably the [[least common denominator]], which is the least common multiple of the {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

This means that each {{mvar|Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a factor of {{mvar|D}}, so {{nowrap|1={{mvar|D}} = {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} for some expression {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} that is not a fraction. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i}{R_i Q_i} = \frac{R_i P_i} D \,,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that {{mvar|R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not assume the value 0 – in which case also {{mvar|D}} equals 0.

So we have now

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{P_i}{Q_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i P_i} D = \frac 1 D \sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Provided that {{mvar|D}} does not assume the value 0, the latter equation is equivalent with

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n R_i P_i = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the denominators have vanished.

As shown by the provisos, care has to be taken not to introduce [[Zero of a function|zero]]s of {{mvar|D}} – viewed as a function of the [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]]s of the equation – as [[spurious solution]]s.

==Example 2==

Consider the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x(x+1)}+\frac{1}{x(x+2)}-\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The least common denominator is {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}}.

Following the method as described above results in

:&lt;math&gt;(x+2)+(x+1)-x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying this further gives us the solution {{nowrap|1={{mvar|x}} = −3}}.

It is easily checked that none of the zeros of {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}({{mvar|x}} + 1)({{mvar|x}} + 2)}} – namely {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = 0}}, {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −1}}, and {{nowrap|1= {{mvar|x}} = −2}} – is a solution of the final equation, so no spurious solutions were introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="964">'''Echo removal''' is the process of removing [[echo]] and [[reverberation]] artifacts from audio signals. The reverberation is typically modeled as the [[convolution]] of a (sometimes time-varying) [[impulse response]] with a hypothetical clean input signal, where both the clean input signal (which is to be recovered) and the impulse response are unknown. This is an example of an [[inverse problem]]. In almost all cases, there is insufficient information in the input signal to uniquely determine a plausible original image, making it an [[ill-posed problem]]. This is generally solved by the use of a [[regularization (physics)|regularization]] term to attempt to eliminate implausible solutions.

This problem is analogous to [[deblurring]] in the image processing domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56812">A person's '''Erdős–Bacon number''' is the sum of one's [[Erdős number]]—which measures the "collaborative distance" in authoring academic papers between that person and Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]—and one's [[Bacon number]]—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the individual is separated from American actor [[Kevin Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Singh2002&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=And the winner tonight is |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |work=The Telegraph |date=May 1, 2002 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112081753/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday20070814&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |title=There's not much separating her from Bacon, Erdos |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104060408/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the number, the closer a person is to Erdős and Bacon, which reflects a [[small world phenomenon]] in academia and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/30835 |year=1998 |last1=Collins |first1=James J. |last2=Chow |first2=Carson C. |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6684 |pages=409–10 |pmid=9623993 |title=It's a small world|bibcode=1998Natur.393..409C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined Erdős/Bacon [sic]&lt;!-- was originally written with a slash --&gt; number was introduced by mathematicians Tim Hsu and David Grabiner sometime before late-January 1999, when they pointed out that [[Daniel Kleitman]] has a combined number of 3: a Bacon number of 2 and Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref name="enp1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |title=The Erdös Number Project |first=Jerry |last=Grossman |date=January 27, 1999 |publisher=Oakland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203155656/http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |archivedate=1999-02-03}}. Current version at {{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp |title=The Erdös Number Project |publisher=Oakland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a defined Erdős–Bacon number, it is necessary to have both appeared in a film and co-authored an academic paper, although this in and of itself is not sufficient.
&lt;!--Paul Erdős has an Erdős–Bacon number of 3, having a Bacon number of 3 and an Erdős number of 0. He appeared in ''[[N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős]]'' alongside [[Ronald Graham]], who was in ''[[Director's Cut (film)|Director's Cut]]''{{dubious|date=March 2018}}--&gt;&lt;!--Whatever IMDb might say, I am by no means convinced that renowned mathematician [[Ronald Graham]] took time out to appear in a low-budget horror movie--&gt;&lt;!-- (2016) with Dave Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name |id=nm3083308 |name=Dave Johnson (XXVII)}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' with [[Kevin Bacon]].--&gt;&lt;!--Removed until a better/non-OR source is found for Erdős' Bacon number.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20136">[[File:Exponential.svg|thumb|300px|right|The graph illustrates how exponential growth (green) surpasses both linear (red) and cubic (blue) growth. {{legend|green|Exponential growth}} {{legend|blue|[[Polynomial|Cubic growth]]}} {{legend|red|[[Linear growth]]}}]]

'''Exponential growth''' is exhibited when the [[Rate (mathematics)#Of change|rate of change]]—the change per instant or unit of time—of the value of a mathematical function is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the function's current value, resulting in its value at any time being an [[exponential function]] of time, i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent.
[[Exponential decay]] occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative.  In the case of a discrete [[Domain of a function|domain]] of definition with equal intervals, it is also called '''geometric growth''' or '''geometric decay''', the function values forming a [[geometric progression]].  In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable ''x'' at the growth rate ''r'', as time ''t'' goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of ''x'' at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication.  For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 5% = 0.05}} per interval, the passage of one interval would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05}}; two intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05}}; and three intervals would give {{nowrap|1=50 × 1.05&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 50 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05}}.  In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent.  (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the [[associative property]] of multiplication.)

Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an [[exponential function]].  This contrasts with growth based on a [[power function]], where the time variable is the base value raised to a fixed exponent, such as cubic growth (or in general terms denoted as [[Growth_rate_(group_theory)|polynomial growth]]).

*'''[[Biology]]'''
** The number of [[microorganism]]s in a [[microbiological culture|culture]] will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted. Typically the first organism [[cell division|splits]] into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism  and gene expression.&lt;ref name="SlavovBudnik2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Budnik|first2=Bogdan A.|last3=Schwab|first3=David|last4=Airoldi|authorlink4=Edoardo Airoldi|first4=Edoardo M.|last5=van Oudenaarden|first5=Alexander|title=Constant Growth Rate Can Be Supported by Decreasing Energy Flux and Increasing Aerobic Glycolysis|journal=Cell Reports|volume=7|issue=3|year=2014|pages=705–714|issn=2211-1247|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.057|pmid=24767987|pmc=4049626}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
** A virus (for example [[SARS]], or [[smallpox]]) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial [[immunization]] is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.
** [[World population|Human population]], if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see [[logistic growth]]). For example, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the [[doubling time]] of the American population (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Census Data, "U.S. Census Bureau", 20 Dec 2012, Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20121220035511/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Physics]]'''
** [[Avalanche breakdown]] within a [[dielectric]] material. A free [[electron]] becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied [[electrical field]] that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of the dielectric media. These ''secondary'' electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete [[dielectric breakdown]] of the material.
** [[Nuclear chain reaction]] (the concept behind [[nuclear reactors]] and [[nuclear weapons]]). Each [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that undergoes [[Nuclear fission|fission]] produces multiple [[neutron]]s, each of which can be [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the [[probability]] of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[shape]] and [[mass]] of the uranium), ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. "Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq2.html|title=Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design|publisher=Nuclear Weapons Archive|last=Sublette|first=Carey|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive feedback]] within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic [[Amplifier|amplification]] can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although [[resonance]] effects may favor some [[component frequencies]] of the signal over others.
* '''[[Economics]]'''
** [[Economic growth]] is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.
* '''[[Finance]]'''
** [[Compound interest]] at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also [[rule of 72]].
** [[Pyramid scheme]]s or [[Ponzi scheme]]s also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.
* [[Computer|'''Computer technology''']]
** [[Clock rate|Processing power]] of computers. See also [[Moore's law]] and [[technological singularity]]. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].)
** In [[computational complexity theory]], computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, if a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 10}} requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 11}} requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 12}} will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of [[Moore's Law]] do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size ''x'' in time ''t'', then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size ''x'' + constant in the same time ''t''. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

==Basic formula==
A quantity ''x'' depends exponentially on time ''t'' if

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' is the initial value of ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=a\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the constant ''b'' is a positive growth factor, and ''τ'' is the [[time constant]]—the time required for ''x'' to increase by one factor of ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\tau)=a \cdot b^{\frac{t+\tau}{\tau}} = a \cdot b^{\frac{t}{\tau}} \cdot b^{\frac{\tau}{\tau}} = x(t)\cdot b\, .&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, then ''x'' has exponential growth. If {{nowrap|''τ'' &lt; 0}} and {{nowrap|''b'' &gt; 1}}, or {{nowrap|''τ'' &gt; 0}}  and 0 &lt; {{nowrap|''b'' &lt; 1}}, then ''x'' has [[exponential decay]].

Example: ''If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?''  The question implies ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;min.

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=a\cdot b^{t/\tau}=1\cdot 2^{(60\text{ min})/(10\text{ min})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(1\text{ hr})= 1 \cdot 2^6 =64.&lt;/math&gt;

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''τ'') of a [[dimensionless]] non-negative number ''b'' and an amount of time ''τ'' (a [[physical quantity]] which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with ''τ'' proportional to log&amp;nbsp;''b''. For any fixed ''b'' not equal to 1 (e.g. ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time ''τ''. For any non-zero time ''τ'' the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number&amp;nbsp;''b''.

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different [[exponentiation|base]].  The most common forms are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0\cdot e^{kt} = x_0\cdot e^{t/\tau} = x_0 \cdot 2^{t/T}
= x_0\cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^{t/p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the initial quantity ''x''(0).

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The ''growth constant'' ''k'' is the [[frequency]] (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ''e''; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return,  [[continuous compounding|continuously compounded return]], or [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]].
* The ''[[e-folding|e-folding time]]'' ''τ'' is the time it takes to grow by a factor ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''.
* The ''[[doubling time]]'' ''T'' is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase ''r'' (a dimensionless number) in a period ''p''.
The quantities ''k'', ''τ'', and ''T'', and for a given ''p'' also ''r'', have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{\ln 2}{T} = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 0 corresponds to ''r'' = 0 and to ''τ'' and ''T'' being infinite.

If ''p'' is the unit of time the quotient ''t''/''p'' is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation ''t'' for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, ''t''/''p'' can be replaced by ''t'', but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by ''p'' in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the [[rule of 70]],
i.e. &lt;math&gt;T \simeq 70 / r&lt;/math&gt;.

{{wide image|doubling_time_vs_half_life.svg|640px|Graphs comparing doubling times and half lives of exponential growths (bold lines) and decay (faint lines), and their 70/''t'' and 72/''t'' approximations.

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable ''x'' exhibits exponential growth according to &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x_0(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;, then the log (to any base) of ''x'' [[linear function|grows linearly]] over time, as can be seen by taking [[logarithm]]s of both sides of the exponential growth equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log x(t) = \log x_0 + t \cdot \log (1+r).&lt;/math&gt;

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a [[Nonlinear regression#Linearization|log-linear model]]. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on ''x'', one can [[linear regression|linearly regress]] log ''x'' on ''t''.

==Differential equation==
The [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;x(t)=x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[linear differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\, \frac{dx}{dt} = kx&lt;/math&gt;

saying that the change per instant of time of ''x'' at time ''t'' is proportional to the value of ''x''(''t''), and ''x''(''t'') has the [[initial value]]
:&lt;math&gt;x(0).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = kx \\[5pt]
\frac{dx} x &amp; = k\, dt \\[5pt]
\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} \frac{dx}{x} &amp; = k \int_0^t  \, dt \\[5pt]
\ln \frac{x(t)}{x(0)} &amp; =  kt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) =  x(0) e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above differential equation, if {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 0}}, then the quantity experiences [[exponential decay]].

For a [[nonlinear]] variation of this growth model see [[logistic function]].

==Difference equation==
The [[difference equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = a \cdot x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt;x_t = x_0 \cdot a^t,&lt;/math&gt;

showing that ''x'' experiences exponential growth.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]) as well as any [[polynomial]] growth, i.e., for all α:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} {t^\alpha \over ae^t} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See [[Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values]].

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called [[hyperbolic growth]]. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the [[hyperoperation]]s beginning at [[tetration]], and &lt;math&gt;A(n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, the diagonal of the [[Ackermann function]].

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored [[negative feedback]] factors become significant (leading to a [[logistic growth]] model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential stories==

===Rice on a chessboard===
{{see also|Wheat and chessboard problem}}
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made [[chessboard]]. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; grains on the ''n''th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ({{aka}} [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Jonathan|title=Capitalism: as if the world matters|year=2005|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|isbn=1-84407-192-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[second half of the chessboard]] is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and, if left unchecked, it will smother the pond in thirty days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant's growth is small and so it is decided that it shall be cut down when the water lilies cover half of the pond. The children are then asked on what day will half of the pond be covered in water lilies.  The solution is simple when one considers that the water lilies must double to completely cover the pond on the thirtieth day.  Therefore, the water lilies will cover half of the pond on the twenty-ninth day. There is only one day to save the pond. (From Meadows ''et al''. 1972)&lt;ref name=Porritt-2005/&gt;

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamar, “What Makes a Pollock Pollock: A Machine Vision Approach”, International Journal of Arts and Technology, vol. 8, 1-10, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''hierarchy''' is a set-theoretical object, consisting of a [[preorder]] defined on a set. This is often referred to as an [[ordered set]], though that is an ambiguous term that many authors reserve for [[partially ordered set]]s or [[totally ordered set]]s. The term ''pre-ordered set'' is unambiguous, and is always synonymous with a mathematical hierarchy. The term ''hierarchy'' is used to stress a ''[[hierarchical]]'' relation among the elements.

Sometimes, a set comes equipped with a natural hierarchical structure. For example, the set of natural numbers ''N'' is equipped with a natural pre-order structure, where &lt;math&gt;n \le n'&lt;/math&gt; whenever we can find some other number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;n + m = n'&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; is bigger than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; only because we can get to &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ''using'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. This is true for any commutative monoid. On the other hand, the set of integers ''Z'' requires a more sophisticated argument for its hierarchical structure, since we can always solve the equation &lt;math&gt;n + m = n'&lt;/math&gt; by writing &lt;math&gt;m = (n'-n)&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013 |reason="The argument should be provided here in the text."}}

A mathematical hierarchy (a pre-ordered set) should not be confused with the more general concept of a [[hierarchy]] in the social realm, particularly when one is constructing computational models which are used to describe real-world social, economic or political systems. These hierarchies, or [[complex networks]], are much too rich to be described in the category [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Set Set] of sets.&lt;ref&gt;We may need a bigger [[topos]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is not just a pedantic claim; there are also mathematical hierarchies which are not describable using set theory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Another natural hierarchy arises in [[computer science]], where the word refers to [[poset|partially ordered set]]s whose elements are [[class (set theory)|classes]] of objects of increasing [[complexity]]. In that case, the preorder defining the hierarchy is the class-containment relation. [[Containment hierarchy|Containment hierarchies]] are thus special cases of hierarchies.

==Related terminology==
Individual elements of a hierarchy are often called '''levels''' and a hierarchy is said to be infinite if it has infinitely many distinct levels but said to '''collapse''' if it has only finitely many distinct levels.

==Example==
In [[theoretical computer science]], the [[time hierarchy]] is a classification of [[decision problem]]s according to the amount of time required to solve them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16821">The mathematical field of [[combinatorics]] was studied to varying degrees in numerous ancient societies.  Its study in Europe dates to the work of [[Leonardo Fibonacci]] in the 13th century AD, which introduced Arabian and Indian ideas to the continent.  It has continued to be studied in the modern era.

==Earliest records==
[[File:Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.jpg|right|thumb|A portion of the Rhind papyrus.]]

The earliest recorded use of combinatorial techniques comes from problem 79 of the [[Rhind papyrus]], which dates to the 16th century BCE.  The problem concerns a certain geometric series, and has similarities to Fibonacci's problem of counting the number of [[composition (combinatorics)|compositions]] of 1s and 2s that sum to a given total.&lt;ref name="Biggs" /&gt;

In Greece, [[Plutarch]] wrote that [[Xenocrates]] of Chalcedon (396–314 BC) discovered the number of different syllables possible in the Greek language. This would have been the first attempt on record to solve a difficult problem in [[permutations and combinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|first1=Sir Thomas|title=A history of Greek mathematics|date=1981|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486240738|edition= Reprod. en fac-sim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The claim, however, is implausible: this is one of the few mentions of combinatorics in Greece, and the number they found, 1.002&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/sup&gt;, seems too round to be more than a guess.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vyākhyāprajñapti|Bhagavati Sutra]] had the first mention of a combinatorics problem; the problem asked how many possible combinations of tastes were possible from selecting tastes in ones, twos, threes, etc. from a selection of six different tastes (sweet, pungent, astringent, sour, salt, and bitter). The Bhagavati is also the first text to mention the [[Binomial coefficient|choose function]].&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web|title=India|url=http://binomial.csueastbay.edu/India.html|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second century BC, [[Pingala]] included an enumeration problem in the [[Sanskrit prosody|Chanda Sutra]] (also Chandahsutra) which asked how many ways a six-syllable meter could be made from short and long notes.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rachel|last=Hall|title=Math for Poets and Drummers-The Mathematics of Meter|date=2005-02-16|url=http://www.sju.edu/~rhall/Rhythms/poets.pdf|accessdate=2008-03-05|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulkarni"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Amba|title=Recursion and Combinatorial Mathematics in Chandashāstra|arxiv=math/0703658|bibcode=2007math......3658K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pingala found the number of meters that had &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; long notes and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; short notes; this is equivalent to finding the [[binomial coefficients]].

The ideas of the Bhagavati were generalized by the Indian mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] in 850 AD, and Pingala's work on [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] was expanded by [[Bhāskara II]]&lt;ref name="India" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilavati"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Iching-hexagram-37.svg|left|frame|A [[I Ching|hexagram]]]]

The ancient Chinese book of divination [[I Ching]] describes a hexagram as a permutation with repetitions of six lines where each line can be one of two states: solid or dashed. In describing hexagrams in this fashion they determine that there are &lt;math&gt;2^6=64&lt;/math&gt; possible hexagrams. A Chinese monk also may have counted the number of configurations to a game similar to [[Go (board game)|Go]] around 700 AD.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné"&gt;{{cite web

China corresponded with the Middle East about this problem in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Biggs" /&gt; The Middle East also learned about binomial coefficients from Indian work and found the connection to polynomial expansion.&lt;ref name="Middle East"&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East|url=http://binomial.csueastbay.edu/MidEast.html|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Hindus influenced Arabs as seen in the work of [[al-Khalil ibn Ahmad]] who considered the possible arrangements of letters to form syllables. His calculations show an understanding of permutations and combinations. In a passage from the work of Arab mathematician Umar al-Khayyami that dates to around 1100, it is corroborated that the Hindus had knowledge of binomial coefficients, but also that their methods reached the middle east.

In Greece, [[Plutarch]] wrote that Xenocrates discovered the number of different syllables possible in the Greek language. While unlikely, this is one of the few mentions of Combinatorics in Greece. The number they found, 1.002&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/sup&gt;, also seems too round to be more than a guess.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gow"/&gt;

[[Al-Karaji|Abū Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn al Ḥusayn Al-Karaji]] (c.953-1029) wrote on the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle. In a now lost work known only from subsequent quotation by [[al-Samaw'al]], [[Al-Karaji]] introduced the idea of argument by mathematical induction.

The [[philosopher]] and [[astronomer]] Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (c. 1140) counted the permutations with repetitions in vocalization of Divine Name.&lt;ref&gt;The short commentary on Exodus 3:13&lt;/ref&gt; He also established the symmetry of [[binomial coefficient]]s, while a closed formula was obtained later by the [[talmudist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Levi ben Gerson]] (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_11.Mathematics.Mathematics/Ch-07(Permutation%20and%20Combinations%20FINAL%20%2004.01.06).pdf History of Combinatorics], chapter in a textbook.&lt;/ref&gt;
The arithmetical triangle— a graphical diagram showing relationships among the [[binomial coefficient]]s— was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as [[Pascal's triangle]].  Later, in [[Medieval England]], [[campanology]] provided examples of what is now known as [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s in certain [[Cayley graph]]s on permutations.&lt;ref&gt;

==Combinatorics in the West==
Combinatorics came to Europe in the 13th century through mathematicians [[Leonardo Fibonacci]] and [[Jordanus de Nemore]]. Fibonacci's [[Liber Abaci]] introduced many of the Arabian and Indian ideas to Europe, including that of the Fibonacci numbers.&lt;ref name="Devlin"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanus was the first person to arrange the binomial coefficients in a triangle, as he did in proposition 70 of ''De Arithmetica''. This was also done in the Middle East in 1265, and China around 1300.&lt;ref name="Biggs" /&gt; Today, this triangle is known as [[Pascal's triangle]].

[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s contribution to the triangle that bears his name comes from his work on formal proofs about it, and the connections he made between Pascal's triangle and probability.&lt;ref name="Biggs" /&gt; From a letter [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] sent to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] we learn that Leibniz was formally studying the mathematical theory of [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] in the 17th century, although no formal work was published. Together with Leibniz, Pascal published [[De Arte Combinatoria]] in 1666 which was reprinted later.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz's habilitation thesis ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' was published as a book in 1666 and reprinted later''&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal and Leibniz are considered the founders of modern combinatorics.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite book

Both Pascal and Leibniz understood that the [[binomial expansion]] was equivalent to the [[choice function]]. The notion that algebra and combinatorics corresponded was expanded by De Moivre, who found the expansion of a multinomial.&lt;ref name="De Moivre"&gt;{{cite book

In the 18th century, [[Euler]] worked on problems of combinatorics, and several problems of probability which are linked to combinatorics. Problems Euler worked on include the [[Knights tour]], [[Graeco-Latin square]], [[Eulerian numbers]], and others. To solve the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] problem he invented graph theory, which also led to the formation of [[topology]]. Finally, he broke ground with [[Partition of a set|partitions]] by the use of [[generating functions]].&lt;ref name="Euler Archive"&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary combinatorics==
In the 19th century, the subject of [[partially ordered set]]s and [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] originated in the work of [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]]. However, it was [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s seminal work in his book ''Lattice Theory'' published in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birkhoff|first1=Garrett|title=Lattice theory|date=1984|publisher=American Mathematical Society|location=Providence, R.I.|isbn=978-0821810255|edition= 3d ed., reprinted with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[John von Neumann]] that truly established the subjects.&lt;ref name = "Stanley" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanley|first1=Richard P.|title=Enumerative combinatorics.|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=1107602629|pages=391–393|edition= 2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, [[Philip Hall|Hall]] (1936) and [[Louis Weisner|Weisner]] (1935) independently stated the general Möbius inversion formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bender|first1=Edward A.|last2=Goldman|first2=J.&amp;nbsp;R.|title=On the applications of Möbius inversion in combinatorial analysis|journal=Amer.

The '''history of computing''' is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.  

==Concrete devices==
 
Digital [[computing]] is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/computing/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/digital-computing|title=Digital Computing - Dictionary definition of Digital Computing {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts are implicit in concrete practices such as :
*''[[one-to-one correspondence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/maths/continuum/Pages/onetoone.aspx One-to-One Correspondence: Foundation Level]&lt;/ref&gt; a rule to [[counting|count]] ''how many'' items, say on a [[tally stick]], eventually abstracted into ''numbers'';
*''comparison to a standard'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method for assuming ''[[reproducibility]]'' in a [[measurement]], for example, the number of [[coin]]s 	
*the ''3-4-5'' right triangle was a device for assuring a ''right angle'', using [[rope]]s with 12 evenly spaced [[knot]]s, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/345Triangle.html|title=3, 4, 5 Triangle|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach [[sequence]]s to others. All known languages have words for at least [[numbers in various languages|"one" and "two"]] (although this is disputed: see [[Piraha language]]), and even some animals like the [[common blackbird|blackbird]] can distinguish a surprising number of items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Konrad Lorenz|authorlink1=Konrad Lorenz|year=1961|title=King Solomon's Ring|translator1=Marjorie Kerr Wilson|publisher=Methuen|location=London|isbn=0-416-53860-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in the [[numeral system]] and [[mathematical notation]] eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be [[theorem|stated formally]], and even [[mathematical proof|proven]]. See, for example, [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

By the High Middle Ages, the [[positional notation|positional]] [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] had reached [[Europe]], which allowed for systematic computation of numbers. During this period, the representation of a calculation on [[paper]] actually allowed calculation of [[mathematical expression]]s, and the tabulation of [[mathematical function]]s such as the [[square root]] and the [[common logarithm]] (for use in multiplication and division) and the [[trigonometric function]]s. By the time of [[Isaac Newton]]'s research, paper or vellum was an important computing resource, and even in our present time, researchers like [[Enrico Fermi]] would cover random scraps of paper with calculation, to satisfy their curiosity about an equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIY: Enrico Fermi’s Back of the Envelope Calculations|url=http://www.knowqout.com/science-technology/diy-enrico-fermis-back-of-the-envelope-calculations/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even into the period of programmable calculators, [[Richard Feynman]] would unhesitatingly compute any steps which overflowed the memory of the calculators, by hand, just to learn the answer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Early computation==
{{Main|Timeline of computing hardware 2400 BC–1949}}

{{relevance inline|date=May 2018}}
The earliest known tool for use in computation is the [[Sumer]]ian [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] c. 2700–2300 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known computer and most advanced system of calculation known to date - preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In c. 1050–771 BC, the [[south-pointing chariot]] was invented in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. It was the first known [[gear]]ed mechanism to use a [[differential gear]], which was later used in [[analog computer]]s. The [[China|Chinese]] also invented a more sophisticated abacus from around the 2nd century BC known as the [[Chinese abacus]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the 5th century BC in [[History of India|ancient India]], the [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Pāṇini]] formulated the [[grammar]] of [[Sanskrit]] in 3959 rules known as the [[Ashtadhyayi]] which was highly systematized and technical. Panini used metarules, [[Transformational grammar|transformations]] and [[recursion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0024-3841(78)90076-1| title = On the status of recursive rules in transformational grammar| journal = [[Lingua (journal)|Lingua]]| volume = 44| issue = 2–3| pages = 169| year = 1978| last1 = Sinha | first1 = A. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]] used the mechanical principle of balance (see [[Archimedes Palimpsest#Mathematical content]]) to calculate mathematical problems, such as the number of grains of sand in the universe (''[[The sand reckoner]]''), which also required a recursive notation for numbers (e.g., the [[myriad]] [[myriad]]).

Around 200 BC the development of gears had made it possible to create devices in which the positions of wheels would correspond to positions of astronomical objects. By about 100 AD [[Hero of Alexandria]] had described an odometer-like device that could be driven automatically and could effectively count in digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the 1600s that mechanical devices for digital computation appear to have actually been built.

The [[Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/project/general/the-project.html ''The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project''], The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. Retrieved 2007-07-01&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the [[Antikythera]] wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and [[Crete]], and has been dated to ''circa'' 100 BC.

Mechanical analog computer devices appeared again a thousand years later in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and were developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]], such as the mechanical geared [[astrolabe]] by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]],&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html|title=Islam, Knowledge, and Science|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=2008-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119010548/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html|archivedate=2008-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[torquetum]] by [[Jabir ibn Aflah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=R.

During the Middle Ages, several European philosophers made attempts to produce analog computer devices. Influenced by the Arabs and [[Scholasticism]], Majorcan philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315) devoted a great part of his life to defining and designing several ''logical machines'' that, by combining simple and undeniable philosophical truths, could produce all possible knowledge. These machines were never actually built, as they were more of a [[thought experiment]] to produce new knowledge in systematic ways; although they could make simple logical operations, they still needed a human being for the interpretation of results. Moreover, they lacked a versatile architecture, each machine serving only very concrete purposes. In spite of this, Llull's work had a strong influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (early 18th century), who developed his ideas further, and built several calculating tools using them.

Indeed, when [[John Napier]] discovered logarithms for computational purposes in the early 17th century, there followed a period of considerable progress by inventors and scientists in making calculating tools. The apex of this early era of formal computing can be seen in the [[difference engine]] and its successor the [[analytical engine]] (which was never completely constructed but was designed in detail), both by [[Charles Babbage]]. The analytical engine combined concepts from his work and that of others to create a device that if constructed as designed would have possessed many properties of a modern electronic computer.  These properties include such features as an internal "scratch memory" equivalent to [[RAM]], multiple forms of output including a bell, a graph-plotter, and simple printer, and a programmable input-output "hard" memory of [[punch cards]] which it could modify as well as read.  The key advancement which Babbage's devices possessed beyond those created before his was that each component of the device was independent of the rest of the machine, much like the components of a modern electronic computer. This was a fundamental shift in thought; previous computational devices served only a single purpose, but had to be at best disassembled and reconfigured to solve a new problem.  Babbage's devices could be reprogramed to solve new problems by the entry of new data, and act upon previous calculations within the same series of instructions.  [[Ada Lovelace]] took this concept one step further, by creating a program for the analytical engine to calculate [[Bernoulli numbers]], a complex calculation requiring a recursive algorithm.  This is considered to be the first example of a true computer program, a series of instructions that act upon data not known in full until the program is run.

Several examples of analog computation survived into recent times.  A [[planimeter]] is a device which does integrals, using [[distance]] as the analog quantity. Until the 1980s, [[HVAC]] systems used [[air]] both as the analog quantity and the controlling element. Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible, and need to be reconfigured (i.e., reprogrammed) manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early digital computers in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at digital computers were quite limited.

None of the early computational devices were really computers in the modern sense, and it took considerable advancement in mathematics and theory before the first modern computers could be designed.

The first recorded idea of using [[digital electronics]] for computing was the 1931 paper "The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena" by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wynn-Williams | first = C. E. | author-link = C. E.

The 1937 [[Atanasoff–Berry computer]] design was the first digital [[electronics|electronic]] computer (though not programmable), and the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer]] from 1941, by [[Germany|German]] inventor [[Konrad Zuse]] was the first working programmable, fully automatic computing machine.

[[Alan Turing]] modelled computation in terms of a one-dimensional storage tape, leading to the idea of the [[Turing machine]] and [[Turing-complete]] programming systems.

During World War II, ballistics computing was done by women, who were hired as "computers." The term computer remained one that referred to mostly women (now seen as "operator") until 1945, after which it took on the modern definition of machinery it presently holds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Jennifer S.|date=July 1999|title=When Computers Were Women|url=|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=40|pages=455–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose computer, announced to the public in 1946. It was Turing-complete,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} digital, and capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems. Women implemented the programming for machines like the ENIAC, and men created the hardware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Manchester Baby]] was the first electronic [[stored-program computer]]. It was built at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C. Williams]], [[Tom Kilburn]] and [[Geoff Tootill]], and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stored-program [[transistor computer]] was the ETL Mark III, developed by Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/index.html Early Computers], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etl3"&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0011.html 【Electrotechnical Laboratory】 ETL Mark III Transistor-Based Computer], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/history.html Early Computers: Brief History], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1954&lt;ref name="fransman"&gt;Martin Fransman (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_6DMnS1Y12cC&amp;pg=PA19 ''The Market and Beyond: Cooperation and Competition in Information Technology'', page 19], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1956.&lt;ref name="etl3"/&gt;

The [[microprocessor]] was introduced with the [[Intel 4004]]. It began with the "[[Busicom]] Project"&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Masatoshi Shima]]'s three-chip [[CPU]] design in 1968,&lt;ref name=tout1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/busicom_141-pf_and_intel_4004.html|title=The Busicom 141-PF calculator and the Intel 4004 microprocessor|author=Nigel Tout|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; before [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s [[Tadashi Sasaki (engineer)|Tadashi Sasaki]] conceived of a single-chip CPU design, which he discussed with Busicom and [[Intel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="sasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url        = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Tadashi_Sasaki |title      = Oral-History: Tadashi Sasaki |last       = Aspray |first      = William |date       = 1994-05-25 |work       = Interview #211 for the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering |publisher  = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. |accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intel 4004 was then developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Federico Faggin]] and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; The microprocessor led to the development of [[microcomputer]]s, and the [[microcomputer revolution]].

The 1980s brought about significant advances with microprocessor that greatly impacted the fields of engineering and other sciences. The [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000]] microprocessor had a processing speed that was far superior to the other microprocessors being used at the time. Because of this, having a newer, faster microprocessor allowed for the newer [[microcomputer]]s that came along after to be more efficient in the amount of computing they were able to do. This was evident in the 1983 release of the Apple computer Lisa. Lisa was the first personal computer with [[Graphical user interface|graphical user interface (GUI)]] that was sold commercially, she ran on the Motorola 68000, dual floppy disk drives, a 5 MB hard drive and had 1MB of [[Random-access memory|RAM .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/#169ebbe2ad45559efbc6eb3572083fb7|title=Computers {{!}} Timeline of Computer History {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successfully launching Lisa, a year later Apple released its first [[Macintosh]] computer still running on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Another advancement because of microprocessors came from Texas Instruments. Texas Instruments first introduced their [[TMS9900]] processor in June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/tm990/tm990.htm|title=Stuart's TM 990 Series 16-bit Microcomputer Modules|last=Conner|first=Stuart|website=www.stuartconner.me.uk|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then used their microprocessor in their [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI 99/4]] computer.

Late 1980s and beginning in the early 1990s we see more advances with actual computers to aid with actual computing.{{clarify |date=September 2017 |reason=What are "non-actual" computers and computing here?}} In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh Portable]], it was heavy weighing {{cvt|7.3|kg|lb}} and extremely expensive. It was not met with great success and was discontinued only two years later.  That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta [[supercomputer]], which had 512 microprocessors. This technological advancement was very significant as it was used as a model for some of the fastest multi-processors systems in the world. It was even used a prototype for Caltech researchers who used the model for projects like real time processing of satellite images and simulating molecular models for various fields of research.

==Navigation and astronomy==

Starting with known special cases, the calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions can be performed by looking up numbers in a [[mathematical table]], and [[interpolation|interpolating]] between known cases.  For small enough differences, this linear operation was accurate enough for use in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]] in the [[Age of Exploration]]. The uses of interpolation have thrived in the past 500 years: by the twentieth century [[Leslie Comrie]] and [[W.J. Eckert]] systematized the use of interpolation in tables of numbers for punch card calculation.

==Weather prediction==

The numerical solution of differential equations, notably the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] was an important stimulus to computing,
with [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]'s numerical approach to solving differential equations. The first computerised weather forecast was performed in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists [[Jule Charney]], Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist [[Ragnar Fjørtoft]], applied mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and [[ENIAC]] programmer [[Klara Dan von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Fjörtoft and von Neumann, 1950, Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], specifically the philosophical foundations of [[set theory]], '''limitation of size''' is a concept developed by [[Philip Jourdain]] and/or [[Georg Cantor]] to avoid [[Cantor's paradox]]. It identifies certain "inconsistent multiplicities", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] because they are "too large". In modern terminology these are called [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].

==Use==
The [[axiom of limitation of size]] is an axiom in some versions of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. This axiom says that any class which is not "too large" is a set, and a set cannot be "too large". "Too large" is defined as being large enough that the class of all sets can be mapped one-to-one into it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45975">In [[mathematics]], the [[classification of finite simple groups]] states that every [[Finite group|finite]] [[simple group]] is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], or [[alternating group|alternating]], or in one of 16 families of [[groups of Lie type]], or one of 26 [[sporadic group]]s.

The list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their [[order (group theory)|order]], the size of the [[Schur multiplier]], the size of the [[outer automorphism group]], usually some small [[group representation|representations]], and lists of all duplicates.

== Summary ==

The following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2) and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4) both have order 20160, and that the group ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') has the same order as  ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') for ''q'' odd, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) which both have order 4585351680.)

There is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the groups of Lie type ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'').  Some authors use various different fonts for A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to distinguish them.  In particular,
in this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Roman font and the Lie-type groups ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') in italic.

In what follows, ''n'' is a positive integer, and ''q'' is a positive power of a prime number ''p'', with the restrictions noted. The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

'''Notation:''' ''n'' is a positive integer,  ''q'' &gt; 1 is a power of a prime number ''p'', and is the order of some underlying [[finite field]]. The order of the outer automorphism group is written as  ''d''⋅''f''⋅''g'', where ''d'' is the order of the group of "diagonal automorphisms", ''f'' is the order of the (cyclic) group of "field automorphisms" (generated by a [[Frobenius automorphism]]), and ''g'' is the order of the group of "graph automorphisms" (coming from automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]]). The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10605">This is a list of unusually long [[mathematical proof]]s.

{{as of|2011}}, the longest mathematical proof, measured by number of published journal pages, is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] with well over 10000 pages. There are several proofs that would be far longer than this if the details of the computer calculations they depend on were published in full.

==Long proofs==
The length of unusually long proofs has increased with time. As a rough rule of thumb, 100 pages in 1900, or 200 pages in 1950, or 500 pages in 2000 is unusually long for a proof.

*1799 The [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] was nearly proved by [[Paolo Ruffini]], but his proof, spanning 500 pages, was mostly ignored and later, in 1824, [[Niels Henrik Abel]] published a proof that required just six pages
*1890 Killing's classification of simple complex Lie algebras, including his discovery of the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s, took 180 pages in 4 papers.
*1894 The ruler-and-compass construction of a [[constructible polygon|polygon of 65537 sides]] by [[Johann Gustav Hermes]] took over 200 pages.
*1905 [[Emanuel Lasker]]'s original proof of the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] took 98 pages, but has since been simplified: modern proofs are less than a page long.
*1963 [[Odd order theorem]] by Feit and Thompson was 255 pages long, which at the time was over 10 times as long as what had previously been considered a long paper in group theory.
*1964 [[Resolution of singularities]] Hironaka's original proof was 216 pages long; it has since been simplified considerably down to about 10 or 20 pages.
*1966 Abyhankar's proof of [[resolution of singularities]] for 3-folds in characteristic greater than 6 covered about 500 pages in several papers. (In 2009 Cutkosky simplified this to about 40 pages.)
*1966 [[Discrete series representation]]s of Lie groups. Harish-Chandra's construction of these involved a long series of papers totaling around 500 pages. His later work on the Plancherel theorem for semisimple groups added another 150 pages to these.
*1968 the [[Pyotr Novikov|Novikov]]-[[Sergei Adian|Adian]] proof solving [[Burnside's problem]] on finitely generated infinite groups with finite exponents negatively. The three-part original paper is more than 300 pages long. (Britton later published a 282 page paper attempting to solve the problem, but his paper contained a serious gap.)
*1960–1970 [[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique]], [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]] and [[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]. Grothendieck's work on the foundations of algebraic geometry covers many thousands of pages. Although this is not a proof of a single theorem, there are several theorems in it whose proofs depend on hundreds of earlier pages.
*1974 [[N-group theorem]] Thompson's classification of N-groups used 6 papers totaling about 400 pages, but also used earlier results of his such as the [[odd order theorem]], which bring to total length up to more than 700 pages.
*1974 [[Ramanujan conjecture]] and the [[Weil conjectures]]. While Deligne's final paper proving these was "only" about 30 pages long, it depended on background results in algebraic geometry and [[étale cohomology]] that Deligne estimated to be about 2000 pages long.
*1974 [[4-color theorem]]. Appel and Haken's proof of this took 139 pages, and also depended on long computer calculations.
*1974 The [[Gorenstein–Harada theorem]] classifying finite groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4 was 464 pages long.
*1976 [[Eisenstein series]] Langlands's proof of the functional equation for Eisenstein series was 337 pages long.
*1983 [[Trichotomy theorem]] Gorenstein and Lyons's proof for the case of rank at least 4 was 731 pages long, and Aschbacher's proof of the rank 3 case adds another 159 pages, for a total of 890 pages.
*1983 [[Selberg trace formula]] Hejhal's proof of a general form of the Selberg trace formula consisted of 2 volumes with a total length of 1322 pages.
*[[Arthur–Selberg trace formula]]. Arthur's proofs of the various versions of this cover several hundred pages spread over many papers.
*2000 [[Almgren's regularity theorem]] Almgren's proof  was 955 pages long.
*2000 [[Lafforgue's theorem]] on the Langlands conjecture for the general linear group over function fields. [[Laurent Lafforgue]]'s proof of this  was about 600 pages long, not counting many pages of background results.
*2003 [[Poincaré conjecture]], [[Geometrization conjecture|Geometrization theorem]], [[Geometrization conjecture]]. Perelman's original proofs of the Poincaré conjecture and the Geometrization conjecture were not lengthy, but were rather sketchy. Several other mathematicians have published proofs with the details filled in, which come to several hundred pages.
*2004 [[Quasithin group]]s The classification of the simple quasithin groups by Aschbacher and Smith was 1221 pages long, one of the longest single papers ever written.
*2004 [[Classification of finite simple groups]]. The proof of this is spread out over hundreds of journal articles which makes it hard to estimate its total length, which is probably around 10000 to 20000 pages.
*2004 [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]]. The proof takes about 500 pages spread over about 20 papers.
*2005 [[Kepler conjecture]] [[Thomas Callister Hales|Hales]]'s proof of this involves several hundred pages of published arguments, together with several gigabytes of computer calculations.
*2006 the [[strong perfect graph theorem]], by [[Maria Chudnovsky]],  [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Neil Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]], and Robin Thomas. 180 pages in the [[Annals of Mathematics]].

==Long computer calculations==

There are many mathematical theorems that have been checked by  long computer calculations. If these were written out as proofs many would be far longer than most of the proofs above. There is not really a clear distinction between computer calculations and proofs, as several of the proofs above, such as the 4-color theorem and the Kepler conjecture, use long computer calculations as well as many pages of mathematical argument. For the computer calculations in this section, the mathematical arguments are only a few pages long, and the length is due to long but routine calculations.  Some typical examples of such theorems include:

*Several proofs of the existence of [[sporadic simple groups]], such as the [[Lyons group]],  originally used computer calculations with large matrices or with permutations on billions of symbols. In most cases, such as the [[baby monster group]], the computer proofs were later replaced by shorter proofs avoiding computer calculations. Similarly the calculation of the maximal subgroups of the larger sporadic groups uses a lot of computer calculations.
*2004 Verification of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] for the first 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]].
*2007 Verification that [[Checkers]] is a draw.
*2008 Proofs that various [[Mersenne numbers]] with around ten million digits are prime.
*Calculations of large numbers of digits of π.
*2010 Showing that [[Rubik's Cube]] [[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube|can be solved in 20 moves]].
*2012 Showing that  Sudoku needs [https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0749 at least 17 clues] .
*2013 [[Ternary Goldbach conjecture]]: Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. 
*2014 Proof of [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] [[±1-sequence|discrepancy conjecture]] for particular case C=2: every [[±1-sequence]] of the length 1161 has a discrepancy at least 3, original  proof generated by a SAT solver  had a size of  13 gigabytes, it has been reduced later to 850 megabytes.
*2016 Solving [[boolean Pythagorean triples problem]] required generation of 200 terabytes of proof.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/two-hundred-terabyte-maths-proof-is-largest-ever-1.19990&lt;/ref&gt;
*2017 Heule, who coauthored solution to the boolean Pythagorean triples problem, announced 2 petabytes long proof that 5th [[Schur's theorem|Schur's number]] is 160.&lt;ref&gt;Heule, Marijn JH. "Schur Number Five." ''arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.08076'' (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long proofs in mathematical logic==
{{main|Gödel's speed-up theorem}}
[[Kurt Gödel]] showed how to find explicit examples of statements in formal systems that are provable in that system but whose shortest proof is absurdly long. For example, the statement:
:"This statement cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic in less than a googolplex symbols"
is provable in Peano arithmetic but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols. It has a short proof in a more powerful system: in fact it is easily provable in Peano arithmetic together with the statement that Peano arithmetic is consistent (which cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]).

In this argument, Peano arithmetic can be replaced by any more powerful consistent system, and a googolplex can be replaced by any number that can be described concisely in the system.

[[Harvey Friedman]] found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon, giving some explicit statements in Peano arithmetic and other formal systems  whose shortest proofs  are ridiculously long {{harv|Smoryński|1982}}. For example, the statement
:"there is an integer ''n'' such that if there is a sequence of rooted trees ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has at most ''k''+10 vertices, then some tree can be homeomorphically [[Graph embedding|embedded]] in a later one"
is provable in Peano arithmetic, but the shortest proof has length at least ''A''(1000), where ''A''(0)=1 and ''A''(''n''+1)=2&lt;sup&gt;''A''(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;. The statement is a special case of [[Kruskal's theorem]] and has a short proof in [[second order arithmetic]].

[[Image:Knot table.svg|thumb|350px|right|A table of all [[prime knot]]s with seven [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossings]] or fewer (not including mirror images).]]

This article contains a '''list of [[knot (mathematics)|mathematical knots]] and [[link (knot theory)|links]]'''. See also [[list of knots]], [[list of geometric topology topics]].

==Knots==
===Prime knots===
{{See also|List of prime knots}}
*0₁ knot/[[Unknot]] - a simple un-knotted closed loop
*3₁ knot/[[Trefoil knot]] - (2,3)-torus knot, the two loose ends of a common overhand knot joined together
*4₁ knot/[[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] - a prime knot with a crossing number four
*5₁ knot/[[Cinquefoil knot]], (5,2)-torus knot, Solomon's seal knot, pentafoil knot - a prime knot with crossing number five which can be arranged as a pentagram
*5₂ knot/[[Three-twist knot]] - the twist knot with three-half twists
*6₁ knot/[[Stevedore knot (mathematics)]] - a prime knot with crossing number six, it can also be described as a twist knot with four twists
*[[6₂ knot]] - a prime knot with crossing number six
*[[6₃ knot]] - a prime knot with crossing number six
*[[7₁ knot]], septafoil knot, (7,2)-torus knot - a prime knot with crossing number seven, which can be arranged as a {7,2} star polygon
*[[7₄ knot]], "endless knot"
*[[Carrick mat|8&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; knot]], "carrick mat"
*10₁₆₁/[[Perko pair]]
*12n242/[[(−2,3,7) pretzel knot]]
*(''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q'')-[[torus knot]] - a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

===Composite===
*[[Square knot (mathematics)]] - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection
*[[Granny knot (mathematics)]] - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of two identical trefoil knots

==Links==
*0{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Unlink]] - equivalent under ambient isotopy to finitely many disjoint circles in the plane
*2{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Hopf link]] - the simplest nontrivial link with more than one component; it consists of two circles linked together exactly once (L2a1)
*4{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Solomon's knot]] (a two component "link" rather than a one component "knot") - a traditional decorative motif used since ancient times (L4a1)
*5{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Whitehead link]] - two projections of the unknot: one circular loop and one figure eight-shaped loop intertwined such that they are inseparable and neither loses its form (L5a1)
*[[Brunnian link]] - a nontrivial link that becomes trivial if any component is removed
*6{{sup sub|3|2}} link/[[Borromean rings]] - three topological circles which are linked and form a Brunnian link (L6a4)
*[[L10a140 link]] - presumably the simplest non-Borromean Brunnian link
*[[Pretzel link]] -  a [[Montesinos link]] with integer tangles

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4840">A '''Malthusian growth model''', sometimes called a '''simple exponential''' growth model, is essentially [[exponential growth]] based on the idea of the function being proportional to the speed to which the function grows. The model is named after [[ Thomas Robert Malthus]], who wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798), one of the earliest and most influential books on [[population]].&lt;ref name=malthus&gt;"Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population: Library of Economics"&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthusian models have the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; P(t) = P_0e^{rt} &lt;/math&gt;
where

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(0) is the initial population size,
* ''r'' = the population growth rate, sometimes called ''Malthusian parameter'',
* ''t'' = time.

The model can also been written in the form of a differential equation:

dP/dt = rP

with initial condition:
P(0)= P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

This model is often referred to as the ''exponential law''.&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Complex population dynamics: a theoretical/empirical synthesis" Princeton [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7436.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded in the field of [[population ecology]] as the [[first principle]] of [[population dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;Turchin, P. "Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?" Oikos 94:17–26. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Malthus]] as the founder. The exponential law is therefore also sometimes referred to as the ''Malthusian Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Haemig, "Laws of Population Ecology", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By now, it is a widely accepted view to analogize Malthusian growth in Ecology to [[Newton's First Law|Newton's First Law of uniform motion]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Lev R.|title=The theory of population dynamics: I. Back to first principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(86)80180-1|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=122|issue=4|pages=385–399|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus wrote that all life forms, including humans, have a propensity to exponential population growth when resources are abundant but that actual growth is limited by available resources:
{{quote|Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand.... The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. |Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter I.}}

A model of population growth bounded by resource limitations was developed by [[Pierre Francois Verhulst]] in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay. Verhulst named the model a [[logistic function]].

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the [[Architectural engineering|engineering of buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Engineering Overview |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/archeng/archeng.pdf |publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building.&lt;ref name=Leyton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyton |first1=Michael |title=A Generative Theory of Shape |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-42717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are [[aesthetic|considered beautiful]] or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stakhov |first1=Alexey |last2=Olsen |first2=Olsen |title=The Mathematics of Harmony: From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science |date=2009 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-277-582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] with their religious philosophy of number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |authorlink1=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |date=1870 |publisher=Little, Brown |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; architects in [[Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]] and the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] have chosen the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles.&lt;ref name=Vitruvius2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rai/&gt;&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s to decorate buildings.&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite web |last1=van den Hoeven |first1=Saskia |last2=van der Veen |first2=Maartje |title=Muqarnas: Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.jphogendijk.nl/projects/muqarnas2010.pdf |publisher=Utrecht University |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cucker103&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felipe |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.&lt;ref name=Freiberger/&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Greekhse1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|Plan of a Greek house by [[Vitruvius]]]]

====Vitruvius====
{{further information|Vitruvius|Vitruvian module|De architectura}}
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular [[oculus]] to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}, so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last=Roth | first=Leland M. | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder | year=1992 | isbn=0-06-438493-4 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions make more sense when expressed in [[ancient Roman units of measurement]]: The dome spans 150 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]]{{efn|A [[Roman foot]] was about {{convert|0.296|m|ft}}.}}); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high.&lt;ref name=Claridge&gt;{{cite book | last=Claridge | first=Amanda | title=Rome | series= Oxford Archaeological Guides |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford Oxfordshire | year=1998| isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=Lynne C. | title=Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome: Innovations in Context | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-84202-6 |pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{further information|Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

[[File:Houghton Typ 525.69.781 - Serlio, 69.jpg|thumb|left|Architectural perspective of a stage set by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], 1569&lt;ref&gt;Typ 525.69.781, Houghton Library, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.&lt;ref name="Andersen2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Kirsti |title=The Geometry of an Art: The History of the Mathematical Theory of Perspective from Alberti to Monge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-48946-9 |pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] published the influential ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture) in [[Venice]]. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 ''The Elements of Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ruhl&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhl |first1=Carsten |title=Palladianism: From the Italian Villa to International Architecture |url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/educational-journey-grand-tour/carsten-ruhl-palladianism |publisher=European History Online |accessdate=3 October 2015 |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios.

The [[pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|tombs]] constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the [[golden ratio]]. If this was the design method, it would imply the use of [[Kepler triangle|Kepler's triangle]] (face angle 51°49’).&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markowsky, George | url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | title=Misconceptions About the Golden Ratio | journal=The College Mathematics Journal |volume=23 | issue=1 | date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Socrates G. | last=Taseos | title=Back in Time 3104 B.C. to the Great Pyramid | publisher=SOC Publishers | date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is more likely that the pyramids' slope was chosen from the [[Special right triangles|3-4-5 triangle]] (face angle 53°8’), known from the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1650 – 1550 BC); or from the triangle with base to hypotenuse ratio 1:4/π (face angle 51°50’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Midhat | last=Gazale | title=Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=1999 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke concludes that Cantor's conjecture remains uncertain: he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but that "there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles".&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt;

[[Vaastu Shastra]], the ancient [[India]]n canons of architecture and town planning, employs symmetrical drawings called [[mandala]]s.

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (''shikhara'', lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy [[Mount Kailash]], abode of Lord [[Shiva]], depicts the endless repetition of universes in [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web |title=Fractals in Indian Architecture |url=https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers, themselves grouped among still smaller towers, that:

The [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of [[Madurai]] laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras.

===Ancient Greece===
{{further information|Greek architecture|golden ratio|Pythagoreanism|Euclidean geometry}}
[[File:The Parthenon Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] was designed using [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ratios.]]

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]
The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, {{convert|83|m|ft}} tall.

The white marble [[mausoleum]], decorated with [[pietra dura]], the great gate (''Darwaza-i rauza''), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Ebba | title=The Complete Taj Mahal: And the Riverfront Gardens of Agra| edition=1st| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | isbn=0-500-34209-1| pages=24 and passim | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or [[gaz (measure)|gaz]],{{efn|1 gaz is about {{convert|0.86|m|ft}}.}} the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

[[Antoni Gaudí]] used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the [[Sagrada Família]], [[Barcelona]], started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015).

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Educational research}}{{Merge from|Computer-based mathematics education|date=February 2018}}
In contemporary [[education]], '''mathematics education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[mathematics]], along with the associated scholarly [[research]].

Researchers in mathematics education are primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice; however, [[List of mathematics education journals|mathematics education research]], known on the continent of Europe as the [[didactics]] or [[pedagogy]] of mathematics, has developed into an extensive field of study, with its own concepts, theories, methods, national and international organisations, conferences and literature. This article describes some of the history, influences and recent controversies.

==History==
Elementary mathematics was part of the [[Education|education system]] in most ancient civilisations, including [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], [[Vedic civilization|Vedic society]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. In most cases, a formal education was only available to [[male]] children with a sufficiently high status, wealth or [[caste]].
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration at the beginning of a 14th-century translation of Euclid's ''Elements''.]]

In [[Plato]]'s division of the [[liberal arts]] into the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and the [[quadrivium]], the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. This structure was continued in the structure of [[Medieval university|classical education]] that was developed in medieval Europe. Teaching of geometry was almost universally based on [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements''. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants and money-lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.

In the [[Renaissance]], the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce, and considered somewhat un-Christian.&lt;ref name="taboo"&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=486172977 |title=Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years |date=23 Jul 2016 |author=Gabrielle Emanuel |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of [[Natural Philosophy|Natural]], [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Moral philosophy|Moral]] Philosophy.  The first modern arithmetic curriculum (starting with addition, then subtraction, multiplication, and division) arose at [[reckoning school]]s in Italy in the 1300s.&lt;ref name="taboo2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/23/486172977/a-history-lesson-when-math-was-taboo Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spreading along trade routes, these methods were designed to be used in commerce. They contrasted with Platonic math taught at universities, which was more philosophical and concerned numbers as concepts rather than calculating methods.&lt;ref name="taboo2" /&gt;  They also contrasted with mathematical methods learned by [[artisan]] apprentices, which were specific to the tasks and tools at hand. For example, the division of a board into thirds can be accomplished with a piece of string, instead of measuring the length and using the arithmetic operation of division.&lt;ref name="taboo" /&gt;

The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by [[Robert Recorde]], beginning with ''The Grounde of Artes'' in 1540. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE.  These were mostly located in Mesopotamia where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division.  There are also artifacts demonstrating their own methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation.  After the Sumerians some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics come from Egypt in the form of the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].  The more famous [[Rhind Papyrus]] has been dated to approximately 1650 BCE but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll.  This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.

The social status of mathematical study was improving by the seventeenth century, with the [[University of Aberdeen]] creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in [[University of Oxford]] in 1619 and the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] being established by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1662. However, it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities.{{fact|date=April 2018}} [[Isaac Newton]], for example, received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1661.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to an enormous increase in [[urban area|urban]] populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money and carry out simple [[arithmetic]], became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new [[public education]] systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.

By the twentieth century, mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all [[developed country|developed countries]].

During the twentieth century, mathematics education was established as an independent field of research. Here are some of the main events in this development:

* In 1893, a Chair in mathematics education was created at the University of Göttingen, under the administration of [[Felix Klein]]
* The [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI) was founded in 1908, and Felix Klein became the first president of the organisation
* The professional [[periodical literature]] on mathematics education in the U.S.A. had generated more than 4000 articles after 1920, so in 1941 William L. Schaaf published a [[subject indexing|classified index]], sorting them into their various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Schaaf (1941) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b417103;view=1up;seq=11 A Bibliography of Mathematical Education], Forest Hills, N.Y. : Stevinus Press, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A renewed interest in mathematics education emerged in the 1960s, and the International Commission was revitalised
* In 1968, the [[Shell Centre for Mathematical Education]] was established in [[Nottingham]]
* The first [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]] (ICME) was held in [[Lyon]] in 1969. The second congress was in [[Exeter]] in 1972, and after that it has been held every four years

In the 20th century, the cultural impact of the "[[Information Age|electronic age]]" (McLuhan) was also taken up by [[educational theory]] and the teaching of mathematics. While previous approach focused on "working with specialized 'problems' in [[arithmetic]]", the emerging structural approach to knowledge had "small children meditating about [[number theory]] and '[[set theory|sets]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - C 05 - School in Sara, Guinea-Bissau - Boy in front of blackboard - 1974.tif|thumb|Boy doing sums, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]
At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:

* The teaching and learning of basic [[numeracy]] skills to all pupils
* The teaching of practical mathematics ([[arithmetic]], [[elementary algebra]], plane and solid [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]]) to most pupils, to equip them to follow a trade or craft
* The teaching of abstract mathematical concepts (such as [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and [[function (mathematics)|function]]) at an early age
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[Euclidean geometry]]) as an example of an [[axiomatic system]] and a model of [[deductive reasoning]]
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[calculus]]) as an example of the intellectual achievements of the [[modern world]]
* The teaching of advanced mathematics to those pupils who wish to follow a career in [[STEM fields|Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)]] fields.
* The teaching of [[heuristics]] and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems.

==Methods==

The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:

* '''Classical education''': the teaching of mathematics within the [[quadrivium]], part of the classical education curriculum of the [[Middle Ages]], which was typically based on [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] taught as a [[paradigm]] of [[deductive reasoning]].
[[File:Number bingo improves math skills LPB Laos.jpg|thumb|Games can motivate students to improve skills that are usually learned by rote. In "Number Bingo," players roll 3 dice, then perform basic mathematical operations on those numbers to get a new number, which they cover on the board trying to cover 4 squares in a row. This game was played at a "Discovery Day" organized by [[Big Brother Mouse]] in Laos.]]
* '''[[Computer-based math]]''' an approach based around use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation. Mobile applications have also been developed to help students learn mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/06/passing-mathematics-just-got-easier-for-students-with-this-new-platform-mathematica/|title=Passing Mathematics Just Got Easier For Students With This New Platform: Mathematica - Techzim|date=2018-06-16|work=Techzim|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/10/5-apps-help-all-students-math|title=5 Apps to Help All Students with Math|date=2017-10-13|work=Technology Solutions That Drive Education|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/photomath-app-solve-math-problems_n_6025948.html|title=This Free App Will Solve Math Problems For You|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2014-10-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conventional approach''': the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with [[arithmetic]] and is followed by [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[elementary algebra]] taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about [[elementary mathematics]], since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.
* '''[[Exercise (mathematics)|Exercise]]s''': the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding [[vulgar fraction]]s or solving [[quadratic equation]]s.
* '''Historical method''': teaching the [[history of mathematics|development of mathematics]] within an historical, social and cultural context. Provides more [[human interest]] than the conventional approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bharath |last=Sriraman |title=Crossroads in the History of Mathematics and Mathematics Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38a50_NT8oC |year=2012 |publisher=IAP |isbn=978-1-61735-704-6 |series=Monograph Series in Mathematics Education |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mathematics mastery|Mastery]]''': an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing
* '''[[New Math]]''': a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as [[set theory]], functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was [[Morris Kline]]'s 1973 book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add]]''. The New Math method was the topic of one of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: "...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer."
* '''[[Problem solving]]''': the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity and [[heuristic]] thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s to problems from international [[mathematics competitions]] such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. Problem solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students' prior understandings.
* '''[[Recreational mathematics]]''': Mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase enjoyment of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=David Singmaster |first=David |last=Singmaster |title=The Unreasonable Utility of Recreational Mathematics |date=7 September 1993 |work=For First European Congress of Mathematics, Paris, July, 1992 |url=http://anduin.eldar.org/%7Eproblemi/singmast/ecmutil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reform mathematics|Standards-based mathematics]]''': a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] which created the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]].
* '''Relational approach''': Uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120085344/http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helping them to apply mathematics to real world situations outside of the classroom.
* '''[[Rote learning]]''': the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is ''drill and kill''. In [[traditional education]], rote learning is used to teach [[multiplication table]]s, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.

==Content and age levels==
Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or [[honors class]].

Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion, though there are differences. In the [[Mathematics education in the United States|United States]] fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade, whereas in other countries they are usually taught later, since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel |year=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf |page=20 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K-12 topics include [[elementary arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and [[pre-algebra]].

In most of the U.S., [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and analysis ([[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]]) are taught as separate courses in different years of high school. Mathematics in most other countries (and in a few U.S. states) is integrated, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year. Students in many countries choose an option or pre-defined course of study rather than choosing courses ''à la carte'' as in the United States. Students in science-oriented curricula typically study [[differential calculus]] and [[trigonometry]] at age 16–17 and [[integral calculus]], [[complex numbers]], [[analytic geometry]], [[exponential function|exponential]] and [[logarithmic function]]s, and [[infinite series]] in their final year of secondary school. [[Probability]] and [[statistics]] may be taught in secondary education classes.

Science and engineering students in colleges and universities may be required to take [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[linear algebra]].  [[Applied mathematics]] is also used in specific majors; for example, [[civil engineers]] may be required to study [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233214/https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while "math for computer science" might include [[graph theory]], [[permutation]], probability, and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics students would continue to study potentially any area.

==Standards==
Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.

In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In [[England]], for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mathematics curriculum |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=UK Department of Education |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/secondary/b00199003/mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Scotland maintains its own educational system. In the USA, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers have published the national mathematics [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].

Ma (2000) summarised the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ma, X. |title=A longitudinal assessment of antecedent course work in mathematics and subsequent mathematical attainment |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=16–29 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/00220670009598739 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670009598739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has published the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]], which boosted the trend towards [[reform mathematics]]. In 2006, they released ''Curriculum Focal Points'', which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8.  However, these standards are enforced as American states and Canadian provinces choose. A US state's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of the state, and is not mandated by the Federal Government. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/myths-vs-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;"States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has state affiliates that have different education standards at the state level. For example, Missouri has the Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) which has its own pillars and standards of education listed on its website. The MCTM also offers membership opportunities to teachers and future teachers so they can stay up to date on the changes in math educational standards. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.moctm.org/Home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

"Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist".&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws&gt;{{Citation | last = Hiebert | first = James | last2 = Grouws | first2 = Douglas | title = The Effects of Classroom Mathematics Teaching on Students' Learning | place = Reston VA | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | chapter = 9 | pages = 371–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education:

;Important results&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature in effective teaching is giving students "opportunity to learn". Teachers can set expectations, time, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and type of discussions that will influence students' opportunity to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.

;Conceptual understanding&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Institute of Education Sciences | contribution = Highlights From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Mathematics Teaching | year = 2003 | publisher = U.S. Department of Education | url = http://nces.ed.gov/timss}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.

:Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the end result is greater learning. This has been shown to be true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.
 
;Formative assessment&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=P. |last2=Wiliam |first2=Dylan |title=Assessment and Classroom Learning |journal=Assessment in Education |year=1998 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=7–74 |doi=10.1080/0969595980050102 |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/t4/learningandteaching/files/PGCTHE/BlackandWiliam1998.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Formative assessment]] is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers' content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.

;Homework&lt;ref name=ResearchClips&gt;[http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=8468 Research clips and briefs]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Homework which leads students to practice past lessons or prepare future lessons are more effective than those going over today's lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.

;Students with difficulties&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with [[Recall of facts|basic facts]], answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor [[number sense]] and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by [[formative assessment]] and encouraging students to think aloud.

;Algebraic reasoning&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:It is important for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the [[equals sign]] to mean "the answer is...."

===Methodology===
As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. [[Quantitative research]] includes studies that use [[inferential statistics]] to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods in order to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.

[[Qualitative research]], such as [[case studies]], [[action research]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[Jean Piaget|clinical interviews]], depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood ''why'' treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to "lethal mutations"&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt; of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X034005025 | last = Raudenbush | first = Stephen | title = Learning from Attempts to Improve Schooling: The Contribution of Methodological Diversity | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2005 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/5/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.

====Randomized trials====
There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas D. |last=Cook |title=Randomized Experiments in Educational Policy Research: A Critical Examination of the Reasons the Educational Evaluation Community has Offered for Not Doing Them |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–199 |year=2002 |doi=10.3102/01623737024003175 |url=http://epa.sagepub.com/content/24/3/175.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheaffer&gt;{{cite web |author=Working Group on Statistics in Mathematics Education Research |title=Using Statistics Effectively in Mathematics Education Research: A report from a series of workshops organized by the American Statistical Association with funding from the National Science Foundation |year=2007 |publisher=The American Statistical Association |url=http://www.amstat.org/research_grants/pdfs/SMERReport.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shadish, William R. |author2=Cook, Thomas D. |author3=Campbell, Donald T. |year=2002 |title=Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-395-61556-9 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See articles on [[No Child Left Behind|NCLB]], [[National Mathematics Advisory Panel]], [[Scientifically based research]] and [[What Works Clearinghouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods.&lt;ref name=Scheaffer/&gt; On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the United States, the [[Math_wars#National_Mathematics_Advisory_Panel|National Mathematics Advisory Panel]] (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to [[experimental unit]]s, such as classrooms or students.  The NMAP report's preference for randomized experiments received criticism from some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X08329353 | last = Kelly | first = Anthony | title = Reflections on the National Mathematics Advisory Panel Final Report | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 561–4 | year = 2008 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/37/9/561 | postscript = .}} This is the introductory article to an issue devoted to this debate on report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, particularly on its use of randomized experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[What Works Clearinghouse]] (essentially the research arm for the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]) responded to ongoing controversy by extending its research base to include non-experimental studies, including [[regression discontinuity design]]s and [[Case studies|single-case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparks|first=Sarah|title=Federal Criteria For Studies Grow|newspaper=Education Week|date=October 20, 2010|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14268">'''Model order reduction (MOR)''' is a technique for reducing the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of [[mathematical model]]s in [[numerical simulation]]s. As such it is closely related to the concept of [[metamodeling]] with applications in all areas of [[mathematical model]]ling.

== Overview ==
Many modern [[mathematical model]]s of real-life processes pose challenges when used in [[numerical simulation]]s, due to complexity and large size (dimension). '''Model order reduction''' aims to lower the computational complexity of such problems, for example, in simulations of large-scale [[dynamical system]]s and [[control system]]s. By a reduction of the model's associated [[state space]] dimension or [[degrees of freedom]], an approximation to the original model is computed which is commonly referred to as a reduced order model.

Reduced order models are useful in settings where it is often unfeasible to perform [[numerical simulation]]s using the complete full order model.  This can be due to limitations in [[computational resource]]s or the requirements of the simulations setting, for instance [[Real-time computing|real-time simulation]] settings or many-query settings in which a large number of simulations needs to be performed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=Toni |last2=Manzoni |first2=Andrea |last3=Quarteroni |first3=Alfio |last4=Rozza |first4=Gianluigi |title=Model Order Reduction in Fluid Dynamics: Challenges and Perspectives |journal=Reduced Order Methods for Modeling and Computational Reduction |date=2014 |pages=235–273 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozza|first=G.|last2=Huynh|first2=D.

== Methods ==

Model order reduction techniques used most commonly nowadays can be broadly classified into 4 classes:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silva|first=João M.

The simplified physics approach can be described to be analogous to the traditional [[Mathematical model]]ling approach, in which a less complex description of a system is constructed based on assumptions and simplifications using physical insight or otherwise derived information. However, this approach is not often the topic of discussion in the context of model order reduction as it is a general method in science, engineering and mathematics and is not the subject of the current article.

The remaining listed methods fall into the category of projection-based reduction. Projection-based reduction relies on the  projection of either the model equations or the solution onto a basis of reduced dimensionality compared to the original solution space. Methods that also fall into this class but are perhaps less commonly found are:

== Applications ==

Model order reduction finds application within all fields involving mathematical modelling and many reviews exist for the topics of [[electronics]], [[Fluid mechanics|fluid-]] and [[structural mechanics]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PGD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9780511622700|title=Turbulence, Coherent Structures, Dynamical Systems and Symmetry|last=Holmes|first=Philip|last2=Lumley|first2=John L.|last3=Berkooz|first3=Gal|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511622700|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511622700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fluid mechanics===

Current Problems in fluid mechanics involve large [[dynamical system]]s representing many effects on many different scales. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] studies often involve models solving the navier-stokes with a number of [[degrees of freedom]] in the order of magnitude upwards of &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt;. The first usage of model order reduction techniques dates back to the work of Lumley in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lumley |first1=J.L. |title=The Structure of Inhomogeneous Turbulence," In: A. M. Yaglom and V. I. Tatarski, Eds., Atmospheric Turbulence and Wave Propagation |date=1967 |publisher=Nauka |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was used to gain insight into the mechanisms and intensity of [[turbulence]] and [[Coherent turbulent structure|large coherent structure]]s present in fluid flow problems. Model order reduction also finds modern applications in [[Aeronautics]] to model the flow over the body of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=S.|last2=Hassan|first2=O.|last3=Morgan|first3=K.|date=2013|title=Reduced order modelling for unsteady fluid flow using proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis functions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0307904X13002771|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|volume=37|issue=20-21|pages=8930–8945|doi=10.1016/j.apm.2013.04.025|issn=0307-904X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in Lieu et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieu|first=T.|last2=Farhat|first2=C.|last3=Lesoinne|first3=M.|date=2006|title=Reduced-order fluid/structure modeling of a complete aircraft configuration|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045782505005153|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|volume=195|issue=41-43|pages=5730–5742|doi=10.1016/j.cma.2005.08.026|issn=0045-7825|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the full order model of an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16]] fighter-aircraft with over 2.1 million degrees of freedom, was reduced to a model of just 90 degrees of freedom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31426">'''Modern Arabic mathematical notation''' is a [[mathematical notation]] based on the [[Arabic script]], used especially at [[pre-university]] levels of education. Its form is mostly derived from Western notation, but has some notable features that set it apart from its Western counterpart. The most remarkable of those features is the fact that it is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the [[Latin alphabet]] letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.

==Features==
*It is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the [[Latin alphabet]] letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.
*The notation exhibits one of the very few remaining vestiges of [[rasm|non-dotted Arabic scripts]], as dots over and under letters (''[[i'jam]]'') are usually omitted.
*Letter cursivity (connectedness) of Arabic is also taken advantage of, in a few cases, to define variables using more than one letter. The most widespread example of this kind of usage is the canonical symbol for the radius of a circle '''{{lang|ar|نق}}''' ({{IPA-ar|nɑq}}), which is written using the two letters [[nun (letter)|nūn]] and [[qāf]]. When variable names are juxtaposed (as when expressing multiplication) they are written non-cursively.

==Variations==
Notation differs slightly from region to another. In [[tertiary education]], most regions use the [[mathematical notation|Western notation]]. The notation mainly differs in numeral system used, and in mathematical symbol used.

=== Numeral systems ===
There are three numeral systems used in right to left mathematical notation.
*"[[Western Arabic numerals]]" (sometimes called European) are used in western Arabic regions (e.g. [[Morocco]])
*"[[Eastern Arabic numerals]]" are used in middle and eastern Arabic regions (e.g. [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]])
*"Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals" are used in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] speaking regions (e.g. [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]])

Written numerals are arranged with their lowest-value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. That is identical to the arrangement used by Western texts using Hindu-Arabic numerals even though Arabic script is read from right to left. The symbols "٫" and  "٬"  may be used as the [[decimal mark]] and the [[Decimal mark#Digit grouping|thousands separator]] respectively when writing with Eastern Arabic numerals, e.g. {{rtl-lang|ar| ٣٫١٤١٥٩٢٦٥٣٥٨ }} ''3.14159265358'', {{rtl-lang|ar| ١٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠ }} ''1,000,000,000''. Negative signs are written to the left of magnitudes, e.g. {{rtl-lang|ar| ٣− }} ''−3''. In-line fractions are written with the numerator and denominator on the left and right of the fraction slash respectively, e.g. {{rtl-lang|ar| ٢/٧ }} ''2/7''.

===Mirrored Latin symbols===

Sometimes, symbols used in Arabic mathematical notation differ according to the region:

| {{math| {{rtl-lang|fa|{{underset| س←∞ | حــــــــــــد }} س&lt;sup&gt;۴&lt;/sup&gt;}} }}{{ref|b|[b]}}
|}
{{refbegin}}
* {{note|a|a}} {{rtl-lang|ar|نهــــا}} ''nūn''-''hāʾ''-''ʾalif'' is derived from the first three letters of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{rtl-lang|ar|نهاية}}  ''nihāya'' "limit".
* {{note|b|b}} {{lang|fa|حد}} ''ḥadd'' is [[Persian language|Persian]] for "limit".
{{refend}}

Sometimes, mirrored Latin symbols are used in Arabic mathematical notation (especially in western Arabic regions):

|}
{{refbegin}}
* {{note|c|c}} {{rtl-lang|ar|مجــــ}}
{{rtl-lang|ar|مجموع}} ''maǧmūʿ'' means "sum" in [[Arabic language]].
{{refend}}

However, in Iran, usually Latin symbols are used.

{{broader|Rounding}}
[[File:Nearest integer.svg|thumb|300px|A plot of the nearest integer function, rounding to the nearest even integer]]
In [[computer science]], the '''nearest integer function''' of [[real number]] ''x'' denoted variously by &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | title=Nearest Integer Function | urlname=NearestIntegerFunction | accessdate= 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Vert x \Vert&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.W.S. Cassels|title=An introduction to Diophantine approximation|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics|volume=45|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1957|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; nint(''x''), or Round(''x''), is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which returns the nearest [[integer]] to ''x''.  To avoid ambiguity when operating on [[half-integer]]s, a [[rounding]] rule must be chosen.  On most computer implementations{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, the selected rule is to round half-integers to the nearest [[even number|even integer]]—for example, 
:&lt;math&gt;[1.25] = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.75] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.25] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.75] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.25] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.75] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[4.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:etc.
This is in accordance with the [[IEEE 754]] standards and helps reduce bias in the result.

There are many other possible rules for [[rounding#Tie-breaking|tie breaking]] when rounding a half integer include rounding up, rounding down, rounding to or away from zero, or random rounding up or down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">In [[Bayesian inference]], '''plate notation''' is a method of representing variables that repeat in a [[graphical model]].  Instead of drawing each repeated variable individually, a plate or rectangle is used to group variables into a subgraph that repeat together, and a number is drawn on the plate to represent the number of repetitions of the subgraph in the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assumptions are that the subgraph is duplicated that many times, the variables in the subgraph are indexed by the repetition number, and any links that cross a plate boundary are replicated once for each subgraph repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Example==
[[Image:Latent Dirichlet allocation.svg|thumb|right|300px|Plate notation for [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]]]

In this example, we consider [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]], a [[Bayesian network]] that models how documents in a corpus are topically related.  There are two variables not in any plate; ''α'' is the parameter of the uniform [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] prior on the per-document topic distributions, and ''β'' is the parameter of the uniform Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution.

The outermost plate represents all the variables related to a specific document, including &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, the topic distribution for document ''i''.  The ''M'' in the corner of the plate indicates that the variables inside are repeated ''M'' times, once for each document.  The inner plate represents the variables associated with each of the &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; words in document ''i'': &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the topic for the ''j''th word in document ''i'', and &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the actual word used.

The ''N'' in the corner represents the repetition of the variables in the inner plate &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; times, once for each word in document ''i''.  The circle representing the individual words is shaded, indicating that each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is [[observable variable|observable]], and the other circles are empty, indicating that the other variables are [[latent variable]]s.  The directed edges between variables indicate dependencies between the variables: for example, each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and ''β''.

==Extensions==
[[File:bayesian-gaussian-mixture-vb.svg|right|300px|thumb|Bayesian [[multivariate normal distribution|multivariate Gaussian]] [[mixture model]] using plate notation.  Smaller squares indicate fixed parameters; larger circles indicate random variables.  Filled-in shapes indicate known values.  The indication [K] means a vector of size ''K''; [D,D] means a matrix of size ''D''&amp;times;''D''; K alone means a [[categorical variable]] with ''K'' outcomes.  The squiggly line coming from ''z'' ending in a crossbar indicates a ''switch'' — the value of this variable selects, for the other incoming variables, which value to use out of the size-''K'' array of possible values.]]

A number of extensions have been created by various authors to express more information than simply the conditional relationships.  However, few of these have become standard.  Perhaps the most commonly used extension is to use rectangles in place of circles to indicate non-random variables—either parameters to be computed, [[hyperparameter]]s given a fixed value (or computed through [[empirical Bayes]]), or variables whose values are computed deterministically from a random variable.

The diagram on the right shows a few more non-standard conventions used in some articles in Wikipedia (e.g. [[variational Bayes]]):
*Variables that are actually [[random vector]]s are indicated by putting the vector size in brackets in the middle of the node.
*Variables that are actually [[random matrices]] are similarly indicated by putting the matrix size in brackets in the middle of the node, with commas separating row size from column size.
*[[Categorical variable]]s are indicated by placing their size (without a bracket) in the middle of the node.
*Categorical variables that act as "switches", and which pick one or more other random variables to condition on from a large set of such variables (e.g. mixture components), are indicated with a special type of arrow containing a squiggly line and ending in a T junction.
*Boldface is consistently used for vector or matrix nodes (but not categorical nodes).

==Software implementation==
Plate notation has been implemented in various [[TeX]]/[[LaTeX]] drawing packages, but also as part of graphical user interfaces to Bayesian statistics programs such as [[Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling|BUGS]] and [[BayesiaLab]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2363">In [[logic]], the '''contrapositive''' of a [[indicative conditional|conditional]] statement is formed by negating both terms and reversing the direction of inference.  Explicitly,  the contrapositive of the statement "if A, then B" is "if not B, then not A."  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent: if the statement is true, then its contrapositive is true, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Regents Exam Prep, [http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/geometry/GP2/Lcontrap.htm contrapositive] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909195914/http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/geometry/GP2/Lcontrap.htm |date=2012-09-09 }} definition&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, '''proof by contraposition''' is a [[rule of inference]] used in [[Mathematical proof|proofs]]. This rule infers a conditional statement from its contrapositive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~larryc/proofs/proofs.contrapositive.html Larry Cusick's (CSU-Fresno) How to write proofs tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the conclusion "if A, then B" is drawn from the single premise "if not B, then not A."

==Example==

Let ''x'' be an integer.

:To prove: ''If ''x''² is even, then ''x'' is even.

Although a [[direct proof]] can be given, we choose to prove this statement by contraposition. The contrapositive of the above statement is:

:''If ''x'' is not even, then ''x''² is not even.

This latter statement can be proven as follows. Suppose ''x'' is not even. Then ''x'' is odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence ''x''² = ''x''·''x'' is odd. Thus ''x''² is not even.

Having proved the contrapositive, we infer the original statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.|last=Franklin|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|year=2011|title=Proof in Mathematics: An Introduction|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/proofs.html|publisher=Kew Books|location=Sydney|isbn=0-646-54509-4 |author2=A.

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

'''Raymond Clare Archibald''' (7 October 1875 – 26 July 1955) was a prominent Canadian-American mathematician.  He is known for his work as a historian of mathematics, his editorships of mathematical journals and his contributions to the teaching of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stahlman|first=William D.|title=Raymond Claire Archibald (1875--1955)|journal=Isis|year=1956|volume=47|issue=3|pages=244––246|doi=10.1086/348505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Raymond Clare Archibald was born in South Branch, Stewiacke, [[Nova Scotia]] on 7 October 1875. He was the son of Abram Newcomb Archibald (1849—1883) and Mary Mellish Archibald (1849—1901).  He was the fourth cousin twice removed of the famous Canadian-American astronomer and mathematician [[Simon Newcomb]] (1835—1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatersall|first=James|author2=Shawnee McMurran |title=Raymond Clare Archibald: His Life and Work|journal=Proc. Can. Soc. Hist. Phil. Math.|year=2004|volume=17|pages=241–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald graduated in 1894 from [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison College]] with B.A. degree in mathematics and teacher's certificate in violin.  After teaching mathematics and violin for a year at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College he went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received a B.A. 1896 and a M.A. in 1897.  He then traveled to Europe where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during 1898 and received a Ph.D.cum laude from the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] in 1900.  His advisor was Karl Theodor Reye and title of his dissertation was The [[Cardioid]]e and Some of its Related Curves.

He returned to [[Canada]] in 1900 and taught mathematics and violin at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College until 1907.  After a one-year appointment at Acadia University he accepted an invitation of join the mathematics department at [[Brown University]].  He stayed at Brown for the rest of his career becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1943.  While at Brown he created one of the finest mathematical libraries in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0430|work=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald returned to Mount Allison in 1954 to curate the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library, the library he had founded in 1905 to honor his mother.  At his death the library contained 23,000 volumes, 2,700 records, and 70,000 songs in American and English poetry and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|url=http://www.mta.ca/libraryhistory/r_c_archibald.html|work=Pages Through The Ages|publisher=Mount Allison University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Clare Archibald was a world-renowned historian of mathematics with a lifelong concern for the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools.  At the presentation of his portrait to Brown University the head of the mathematics department, Professor [[Clarence Raymond Adams]] (1898–1965) said of him:

"The instincts of the bibliophile were also his from early years.  Possessing a passion for accurate detail, systematic by nature and blessed with a memory that was the marvel of his friends, he gradually acquired a knowledge of mathematical books and their values which has scarcely been equalled.  This knowledge and an untiring energy he dedicated to the upbuilding of the mathematical library at [[Brown University]].  From modest beginnings he has developed this essential equipment of the mathematical investigator to a point where it has no superior, in completeness and in convenience for the user."

==Honors==
Archibald received honorary degrees from the [[University of Padua]] (LL.D., 1922), [[Mount Allison University]] (LL.D., 1923) and from [[Brown University]] (M.A. ad eundem, 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarton|first=George|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|journal=Osiris|year=1956|volume=12|pages=4–34|doi=10.1086/368594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simulink''', developed by [[MathWorks]], is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain [[dynamical systems]]. Its primary interface is a [[visual modeling|graphical block diagramming tool]] and a customizable set of block [[library (computer science)|libraries]]. It offers tight integration with the rest of the [[MATLAB]] environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in [[automatic control]] and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and [[Model-based design|Model-Based Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | title = The Successful development process with MATLAB Simulink in the framework of ESA's ATV project | format = PDF | publisher = Vega Group PLC | accessdate = 2011-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191512/http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/2010-01-1999/|title=Model Based Design Accelerates the Development of Mechanical Locomotive Controls|work=sae.org|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Add-on products ==
MathWorks and other third-party hardware and software products can be used with Simulink. For example, [[Stateflow]] extends Simulink with a design environment for developing [[state machines]] and [[Flowchart|flow charts]].

[[MathWorks]] claims that, coupled with another of their products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_3|title=Automatic Code Generation - Simulink Coder|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink can [[automatic code generation|automatically generate]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] for [[real-time computing|real-time]] implementation of systems. As the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves, this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1296h/1296%20(Denney).pdf A Software Safety Certification Plug-in for Automated Code Generators: Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/general-motors-developed-twomode-hybrid-powertrain-with-mathworks-modelbased-design-cut-24-months-of.html|title=Green Car Congress: General Motors Developed Two-Mode Hybrid Powertrain With MathWorks Model-Based Design; Cut 24 Months Off Expected Dev Time|author=BioAge Media|work=greencarcongress.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being a tool for [[embedded system]] design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Embedded Coder creates code efficient enough for use in embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techsource.com.sg/eresources/eres_storyDetails.asp?stid=10 Lotus Engineering Develops Control Systems Software to Reduce Diesel Emissions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf A Comparison of Three Code Generators for Models Created in Simulink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811055925/http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018215921/http://automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 2007|title=Multitarget modeling reduces ECU software costs|work=EETimes|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulink Real-Time (formerly known as xPC Target), together with x86-based real-time systems, is an environment for simulating and testing Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.  Another MathWorks product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_5|title=Code Generation - Embedded Coder - Simulink|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supports specific embedded targets.  When used with other generic products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/products/slhdlcoder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_6 HDL Coder]&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink and [[Stateflow]] can automatically generate [[logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Matlab.family.png|300px|left|Matlab product family]] --&gt;

Simulink Verification and Validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking, [[requirements traceability]] and model coverage analysis. Simulink Design Verifier uses [[formal methods]] to identify design errors like [[integer overflow]], [[division by zero]] and dead logic, and generates test case scenarios for [[model checking]] within the Simulink environment.

[[SimEvents]] is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the Simulink environment, and to add an event-based simulation engine to the time-based simulation engine in Simulink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation | last=Cassandras| first=Christos | publisher= Springer US | date=2007-11-27 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g82w56/?v=editorial| accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore in Simulink any type of simulation can be done and the model can be simulated at any point in this environment.

Different type of blocks can be accessed using the Simulink library browser. And therefore the benefit could be taken out from this environment efficiently.

'''Sphuṭacandrāpti''' (Computation of True Moon) is a treatise in [[Sanskrit]] composed by the fourteenth-century CE [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala astronomer-mathematician]] [[Sangamagrama Madhava]]. The treatise enunciates a method for the computation of the position of the moon at intervals of 40 minutes each throughout the day. This is one of only two works of Madhava that have survived to modern times, the other one being ''[[Venvaroha|Veṇvāroha]]''. However, both ''Sphuṭacandrāpti'' and ''Veṇvāroha'' have more or less the same contents, that of the latter being apparently a more refined version of that of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45664">The tables contain the [[integer factorization|prime factorization]] of the [[natural number]]s from 1 to 1000.

When ''n'' is a [[prime number]], the prime factorization is just ''n'' itself, written in '''bold''' below.

The number [[1 (number)|1]] is called a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]. It has no [[prime factor]]s and is neither prime nor [[composite number|composite]].

''See also: [[Table of divisors]]'' (prime and non-prime divisors for 1 to 1000)


== Properties ==
Many properties of a natural number ''n'' can be seen or directly computed from the prime factorization of ''n''.
*The '''multiplicity''' of a prime factor ''p'' of ''n'' is the largest exponent ''m'' for which ''p&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' divides ''n''. The tables show the multiplicity for each prime factor. If no exponent is written then the multiplicity is 1 (since ''p'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The multiplicity of a prime which does not divide ''n'' may be called 0 or may be considered undefined.
*Ω(''n''), the [[Big Omega function (prime factor)|big Omega function]], is the number of prime factors of ''n'' counted with multiplicity (so it is the sum of all prime factor multiplicities).
*A [[prime number]] has Ω(''n'') = 1. The first: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 {{OEIS|id=A000040}}. There are many special [[List of prime numbers|types of prime numbers]].
*A [[composite number]] has Ω(''n'') &gt; 1. The first: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21 {{OEIS|id=A002808}}. All numbers above 1 are either prime or composite. 1 is neither.
*A [[semiprime]] has Ω(''n'') = 2 (so it is composite). The first: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34 {{OEIS|id=A001358}}.
*A ''k''-[[almost prime]] (for a natural number ''k'') has Ω(''n'') = ''k'' (so it is composite if ''k'' &gt; 1).
*An [[even number]] has the prime factor 2. The first: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 {{OEIS|id=A005843}}.
*An [[odd number]] does not have the prime factor 2. The first: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 {{OEIS|id=A005408}}. All integers are either even or odd.
*A [[Square number|square]] has even multiplicity for all prime factors (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 {{OEIS|id=A000290}}.
*A [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] has all multiplicities divisible by 3 (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 {{OEIS|id=A000578}}.
*A [[perfect power]] has a common divisor ''m'' &gt; 1 for all multiplicities (it is of the form ''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some ''a'' &gt; 1 and ''m'' &gt; 1). The first: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 {{OEIS|id=A001597}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[powerful number]] (also called '''squareful''') has multiplicity above 1 for all prime factors. The first: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72 {{OEIS|id=A001694}}.
*A [[prime power]] has only one prime factor. The first: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 {{OEIS|id=A000961}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*An [[Achilles number]] is powerful but not a perfect power. The first: 72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968 {{OEIS|id=A052486}}.
*A [[square-free integer]] has no prime factor with multiplicity above 1. The first: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 {{OEIS|id=A005117}}). A number where some but not all prime factors have multiplicity above 1 is neither square-free nor squareful.
*The [[Liouville function]] λ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is -1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*The [[Möbius function]] μ(''n'') is 0 if ''n'' is not square-free. Otherwise μ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is −1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*A [[sphenic number]] has Ω(''n'') = 3 and is square-free (so it is the product of 3 distinct primes). The first: 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154 {{OEIS|id=A007304}}.
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the sum of primes dividing ''n'', counted with multiplicity. It is an [[additive function]].
*A [[Ruth-Aaron pair]] is two consecutive numbers (''x'', ''x''+1) with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+1). The first (by ''x'' value): 5, 8, 15, 77, 125, 714, 948, 1330, 1520, 1862, 2491, 3248 {{OEIS|id=A039752}}, another definition is the same prime only count once, if so, the first (by ''x'' value): 5, 24, 49, 77, 104, 153, 369, 492, 714, 1682, 2107, 2299 {{OEIS|id=A006145}}
*A [[primorial]] ''x''# is the product of all primes from 2 to ''x''. The first: 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030, 510510, 9699690, 223092870, 6469693230, 200560490130, 7420738134810 {{OEIS|id=A002110}}. 1# = 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[factorial]] ''x''! is the product of all numbers from 1 to ''x''. The first: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600 {{OEIS|id=A000142}}. 0! = 1 is sometimes included.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number]] (for a natural number ''k'') has largest prime factor ≤ ''k'' (so it is also ''j''-smooth for any ''j'' &gt; k).
*''m'' is '''smoother''' than ''n'' if the largest prime factor of ''m'' is below the largest of ''n''.
*A [[regular number]] has no prime factor above 5 (so it is 5-smooth). The first: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 {{OEIS|id=A051037}}.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number#Powersmooth numbers|powersmooth]] number has all ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''k'' where ''p'' is a prime factor with multiplicity ''m''.
*A [[frugal number]] has more digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization (when written like below tables with multiplicities above 1 as exponents). The first in [[decimal]]: 125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250 {{OEIS|id=A046759}}.
*An [[equidigital number]] has the same number of digits as its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 {{OEIS|id=A046758}}.
*An [[extravagant number]] has fewer digits than its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 {{OEIS|id=A046760}}.
*An '''economical number''' has been defined as a frugal number, but also as a number that is either frugal or equidigital.
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') ([[greatest common divisor]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors which are both in ''m'' and ''n'' (with the smallest multiplicity for ''m'' and ''n'').
*''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]] (also called relatively prime) if gcd(''m'', ''n'') = 1 (meaning they have no common prime factor).
*lcm(''m'', ''n'') ([[least common multiple]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors of ''m'' or ''n'' (with the largest multiplicity for ''m'' or ''n'').
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') × lcm(''m'', ''n'') = ''m'' × ''n''. Finding the prime factors is often harder than to compute gcd and lcm with other algorithms which do not require known prime factorization.
*''m'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'' (also called ''m'' divides ''n'', or ''n'' is divisible by ''m'') if all prime factors of ''m'' have at least the same multiplicity in ''n''.
The divisors of ''n'' are all products of some or all prime factors of ''n'' (including the empty product 1 of no prime factors).
The number of divisors can be computed by increasing all multiplicities by 1 and then multiplying them.
Divisors and properties related to divisors are shown in [[table of divisors]].

'''''What Is Mathematics?''''' is a [[mathematics]] book written by [[Richard Courant]] and [[Herbert Robbins]], published in England by [[Oxford University Press]].  It is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public.

First published in 1941, it discusses [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[topology]] and [[calculus]].  
A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]].

==Authorship==

The book was based on Courant's course material.
Although Robbins assisted in writing a large part of the book, 
he had to fight for authorship.
Nevertheless, Courant alone held the copyright for the book.
This resulted in Robbins receiving a smaller share of the royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Title==

[[Michael Katehakis]] remembers Robbins' interest in the literature and Tolstoy in particular and he is convinced that the title of the book is most likely  
due to Robbins,  who was inspired by the title of the essay [[what is art|What is Art?]] by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. 
Robbins did the same in the book 
'' Great Expectations : The Theory of Optimal Stopping '' he co-authored with [[Yuan-Shih Chow]] and [[David Siegmund]], 
where one can not miss the connection with the title of the novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]].

According to [[Constance Reid]],&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; Courant finalized the title after a conversation with [[Thomas Mann]].

==Translations==
*The first Russian translation «Что такое математика?» was published in 1947; there were 5 translations since then, the last one in 2010.
*The first Italian translation, ''Che cos'è la matematica?'', was published in 1950. А translation of the second edition was issued in 2000. 
*The first German translation "Was ist Mathematik?" was published in 1962.
*A Spanish translation of the second edition, ''¿Qué Son Las Matemáticas?'', was published in 2002.

[[File:Yupana.jpg|thumb|Sketch of a ''[[Quipucamayoc]]'' from ''[[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]]''. Shown on the lower left side is a yupana.]]

A ''yupana'' (from Quechua yupay: count)&lt;ref name="TOM"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lexiconovocabula00domi Santo Tomas, "Lexicon o Vocabulario de la lengua general del Peru", 1560]&lt;/ref&gt; is  an [[abacus]] used to perform [[arithmetic operations]] dating back to the time of the [[Incas]].

==Types==

The term ''yupana'' refers to two distinct classes of objects:

* '''table-yupana''' (or archaeological yupana): a system of trays of different sizes and materials, carved at the top of the device into geometric boxes, into which seeds or pebbles were placed, presumably for performing complex arithmetic calculations. The first of these tables was found in 1869 in the province of [[Cuenca Canton|Cuenca]] ([[Ecuador]]) and marked the beginning of systematic studies on these objects. All [[archaeological]] finds are very different from each other.&lt;ref name="RDP"&gt;Radicati di Primeglio, [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bibvirtualdata/libros/2008/estud_quipu/cap03.pdf "Il sistema contabile degli Inca: Yupana e Quipu"], 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''yupana of Poma de Ayala''': a picture on page 360 of [[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]] written by the [[chronicler]] of the Indies [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]], representing a 5x4 [[chessboard]].&lt;ref name="GPA"&gt;Guaman Poma de Ayala, [http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm "Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno", 1615]&lt;/ref&gt; The picture, although having some similarities with the majority of table-yupana, presents several differences from these, first of all, the shape of the boxes ([[rectangles]]), when those of table-yupanas are [[polygons]] of varying shape.

Although very different from each other, most of the scholars who have dealt with table-yupana, have then extended its reasoning and theories to the yupana of Poma de Ayala and vice versa, perhaps in an attempt to find a unifying thread or a common method. It should also be noted that the Nueva Coronica was discovered only in 1916 in the [[library]] of [[Copenhagen]] and that part of the studies on it were based on previous studies and theories regarding table-yupanas.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

==History==

Several chroniclers of the Indies described, unfortunately approximately, the Incan abacus and its operation.

===Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala===

The first was Guaman Poma de Ayala that in 1615 approximately, wrote:

{{quote|... They count through tables, numbering from one hundred thousand to one hundred and from ten thousand and ten, until the unit. They keep records of everything that happens in this realm: holidays, Sundays, months and years. These accountants and treasurers of the kingdom are found in every city, town, or indigenous village ...|&lt;ref name="GPA" /&gt;}}

In addition to providing this brief description, Poma de Ayala draws a picture of the yupana: a board of five rows and four columns in which are designed a series of white and black circles.

===José de Acosta===

The father [[Jesuit]] ''José de Acosta'' wrote:

{{quote|... they take the corn and put one here, three there, eight from another part; they move from a box and exchanged three other grains from one to another to finally get the result without error|&lt;ref name="ACO"&gt;José de Acosta - Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias - Libro VI cap XVIII (De los memoriales y cuentas que usaron los Indios del Perú)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Juan de Velasco===

Father ''Juan de Velasco'' wrote:

{{quote|... these teachers were using something like a series of tables, made of wood, stone, or clay, with different separations, in which they put stones of different shapes, colors and angular shapes|&lt;ref name="VEL"&gt;Juan Velasco - “Historia del Reino de Quito” - 1841 44, Tomo II, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Table-yupana==

===Chordeleg===

The first table-yupana which we know was found in 1869 in [[Chordeleg]] in the department of [[Cuenca Canton|Cuenca]] ([[Ecuador]]). It is a [[rectangular]] table (33x27 cm) of [[wood]] which contains 17 compartments, of which 14 [[square]], 2 [[rectangular]] and one [[octagonal]]. On two edges of the table there are other square compartments (12x12 cm) raised and symmetrically arranged one another, to which two square platforms (7x7 cm), are overlapped. These structures are called towers. The table presents a symmetry of the compartments with respect to the [[diagonal]] of the [[rectangle]]. The four sides of the board are also engraved with figures of human heads and a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt; As a result of this discovery, [[Charles Wiener]] began in 1877 a systematic study of these objects. Wiener came to the conclusion that the table-yupanas served to calculate the [[taxes]] that farmers paid to the Incan empire.

===Caraz===

Found at [[Caraz]] in 1878 - 1879, this table-yupana is different from that of Chordeleg as the material of construction is the [[stone]] and the central compartment of octagonal shape is replaced with a rectangular one; towers also have three shelves instead of two.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Callejón de Huaylas===

A series of table-yupanas much different from the first, was described by [[Erland Nordenskiöld]] in 1931. These yupana, made of stone, present a series of rectangular and square compartments. The tower is composed of two rectangular compartments. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the smaller side of the table.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Triangular yupana===

These yupana, made of stone, have 18 compartments of triangular shape, arranged around the table. On one side there is a rectangular tower with only one floor and three triangular compartments. In the central part there are four square compartments, coupled between them.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Chan Chan===

Identical to the yupana of Chordeleg, both for the material and the arrangement of the compartments, this table-yupana was found in the archaeological complex of [[Chan Chan]] in [[Peru]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Cárhua de la Bahía===

Discovered in the province of [[Pisco]] ([[Peru]]), these table-yupanas are two tables in [[clay]] and [[bone]]. The first is rectangular (47x32 cm), has 22 square (5x5 cm) and three rectangular (16x18 cm) compartments, and has no towers. The second is rectangular (32x23 cm) containing 22 square compartments, two L-shaped and three rectangular in the center. The compartments are arranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of the longer side.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Huancarcuchu===

Discovered in the upper [[Ecuador]] by [[Max Uhle]] in 1922, this yupana is made of stone and its bins are drawn. It has the shape of a scale consisting of 10 overlapping rectangles: four on the first floor, three on the second, two in the third and one in the fourth. This yupana is the one that is closest to the picture by Poma de Ayala in Nueva Coronica, while having a line less and being half drawn.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Florio===

C. Florio presents a study &lt;ref name="FLO2"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12063847/Recovering_memory_the_INCA_KEY_as_YANANTIN C. Florio, "Recovering memory - The Inca Key as Yanantin"]&lt;/ref&gt;
which does not identify a yupana in these archaeological findings, but an object whose name is unknown and which has been forgotten. Instead, this object is to connect to the tocapu (an ideogram already used by pre-Incas civilizations) called “llave inca” (i.e. Inca key) and to the [[Yanantin|yanantin-masintin]] philosophy. The scholar reaches this conclusion starting from the lack of objective evidences which recognize a yupana in this object, a belief that consolidated over years only for the repeat of this hypothesis never demonstrated, and by crossing data from the Miccinelli Documents and the tocapu(s) catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Teoria Florio su yupana a casetta - F.png|Fig. E - Tocapu called “llave inca”, Inca key
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Supposing to colour the different compartments of the table-yupana (fig. A), C. Florio identifies a drawing (fig. B) very similar to a really existing tocapu (fig. C) and catalogued by Victoria de la Jara. In addition, in the tocapu reported in figure D, also catalogued by V. de la Jara, Florio identifies a stylization of the tocapu C and the departure point for creating the tocapu “llave inca” (Inca key). She finds the relation between the table-yupana and the Inca key also in their connection with the concept of duality: the table-yupana structure is clearly dual and Blas Valera in “Exul Immeritus Blas Valera populo suo” (one of the two Miccinelli Documents) describes the tocapu we call Inca key as representing the concept of the “opposite forces” and the “number 2”, both strictly linked to the concept of duality.

According to C. Florio, the real yupana used by the Incas is that of Guáman Poma, but with more columns and rows. Guáman Poma would have represented just the part of the yupana useful for carrying out a specific calculation, which Florio identifies to be a multiplication (see below).

==Theories of Yupana Poma de Ayala==

===Henry Wassen===

In 1931, [[Henry Wassen]] studied the yupana of Poma de Ayala, proposing for the first time a possible representation of the numbers on the board and the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. He interpreted the white circles as gaps, carved into yupana in which to insert the seeds described by chroniclers: so the white circles correspond to empty gaps, while the blacks circles correspond to the same gaps filled with a black seed.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

The numbering system at the base of the abacus was positional notation in base 10 (in line with the writings of the chroniclers of the Indies).

The representation of the numbers, then followed a vertical progression such that the units were positioned in the first row from the bottom, in the second the tens, hundreds in the third, and so on.

Wassen proposed a progression of values of the seeds that depends on their position in the table: 1, 5, 15, 30, respectively, depending on who occupy a gap in the first, second, third and fourth columns (see the table below). Only a maximum of five seeds could be included in a box belonging to the first column, so that the maximum value of said box was 5, multiplied by the power of the corresponding line. These seeds could be replaced with one seed of the next column, useful during arithmetic operations. According to the theory of Wassen, therefore, the operations of sum and product were carried out horizontally.

This theory received a lot of criticism due to the high complexity of the calculations and was therefore considered inadequate and soon abandoned.

By way of example, the following table shows the number 13457.

This first interpretation of the yupana of Poma de Ayala was the starting point for the theories developed by subsequent authors, up to the present day. In particular, no one ever moved away from the positional numbering system until 2008.

===Emilio Mendizabal===

[[Emilio Mendizabal]] was the first to propose in 1976 that the [[Inca]] were using, as well as the decimal representation, also a representation based on the progression 1,2,3,5. Mendizabal in the same publication pointed out that the series of numbers 1,2,3 and 5, in the drawing of Poma de Ayala, are part of the [[Fibonacci sequence]], and stressed the importance of "magic" that had the number 5 for civilization the [[north]] of [[Peru]], and the number 8 for the civilizations of the [[south]] of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt;

===Radicati di Primeglio===

In 1979, [[Carlos Radicati di Primeglio]] emphasized the difference of table-yupana from that of Poma de Ayala, describing the state of the art of the research and theories advanced so far. He also proposed the [[algorithms]] for calculating the four basic [[arithmetic operations]] for yupana of Poma de Ayala, according to a new interpretation for which it was possible to have up to nine seeds in each box with vertical progression for powers of ten.&lt;ref name="RDP" /&gt; The choice of Radicati was to associate to each gap a value of 1.

In the following table is represented the number 13457

===William Burns Glynn===

In 1981, the English textile [[engineer]] [[William Burns Glynn]] proposed a positional base 10 solution for the yupana of Poma de Ayala.&lt;ref name="WBG"&gt;William Burns Glynn, [http://www.boletindelima.com/1981-11.htm "Calculation table of the Incas"], ''Bol. Lima No. 11'', 1981, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glynn, as Radicati, adopted the same Wassen's idea of full and empty gaps, as well as a vertical progression of the powers of ten, but proposed an architecture that allowed to greatly simplify the arithmetic operations.

The horizontal progression of the values of the seeds in its representation is 1, 1, 1 for the first three columns, so that in each row is possible to deposit a maximum of ten seeds (5 + 3 + 2 seeds). Ten seeds of any row is correspond to a single seed of the upper line.

The last column is dedicated to the ''memory'', which is a place where you can drop momentarily ten seeds, waiting to move them to the upper line. According to the author, this is very useful during arithmetic operations in order to reduce the possibility of error.

The solution of Glynn has been adopted in various teaching projects all over the world, and even today some of its variants are used in some [[schools]] of [[South America]].&lt;ref name="MRV"&gt;[http://cursa.ihmc.us/rid=1J2NH8QTM-2912G6-PZ5/yupana_como_herramienta_pedagogica.pdf Mora &amp; Valero "La Yupana come strumento pedagogico alle elementari"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIO"&gt;[http://www.seminariodidama.unito.it/fiorentino.pdf Fiorentino, "La yupana elettronica: uno strumento per la didattica interculturale della matematica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicolino de Pasquale===

The [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]] [[Nicolino de Pasquale]] in 2001 proposed a positional solution in base 40 of the yupana of Poma de Ayala, taking the representation theory of [[Fibonacci]] already proposed by [[Emilio Mendizabal]] and developing it for the four operations.

De Pasquale also adopts a vertical progression to represent numbers by powers of 40. The representation of the numbers is based on the fact that the sum of the values of the circles in each row gives as total 39, if each circle takes the value 5 in the first column, 3 in the second column, 2 in the third and 1 in the fourth one; it is thus possible to represent 39 numbers, united to [[neutral element]] ( [[zero]] or no seeds in the table); this forms the basis of 40 symbols necessary for the numbering system.&lt;ref name="DP1"&gt;N. De Pasquale [http://www.quipus.it/DePasquale_Volo%20_del_Condor.pdf "Il volo del condor", ''Pescara Informa'', 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the possible representations of the number 13457 in the yupana by De Pasquale is shown in the following table:

||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;

The theory of De Pasquale opened, in the years after his birth, great controversy among researchers who divided mainly into two groups: one supporting the base 10 theory and another supporting the base 40 one. It should be noted in this regard that the Spanish chronicles of the time of the [[conquest of the Americas]] indicated that the Incas used a decimal system and that since 2003 the base 10 has been proposed as the basis for calculating both with the abacus and the [[quipu]]&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2004/02/02/1036168.htm?site=science/memory Lorenzi, Incan counting system as easy as 1,2,3,5 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Pasquale has recently proposed the use of yupana as astronomical [[calendar]] running in mixed base 36/40&lt;ref name="DP2"&gt;[http://www.quipus.it/english/THE%20SAVED%20KINGDOM.pdf N. De Pasquale, "The Saved Kingdom"]&lt;/ref&gt; and provided its own interpretation of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] word ''huno'', translating it as 0.1.&lt;ref name="DP3"&gt;[http://www.quipus.it/DECIMAL%20POMA.pdf N. De Pasquale, "Decimal Guaman Poma"]&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation diverges from all the chroniclers of the Indies, starting from [[Domingo de Santo Tomas]]&lt;ref name="TOM" /&gt; which in 1560 translated ''huno'' with ''chunga guaranga'' (ten thousand).

===Cinzia Florio===

In 2008 [[Cinzia Florio]] proposes an alternative and revolutionary approach in respect to all the theories proposed so far. For the first time we deviate from the positional numbering system and we adopt the additive, or [[sign-value notation]].&lt;ref name="FLO"&gt;[http://issuu.com/casaeditriceoedipus/docs/cinziaflorio C. Florio, "Incontri e disincontri nella individuazione di una relazione matematica nella yupana in Guaman Poma de Ayala", Salerno, 14-15 maggio e 10-12 Dicembre 2008 - Oédipus Editore, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying exclusively on the design of Poma de Ayala, the author explains the arrangement of white and black circles and interprets the use of the abacus as a board for making [[multiplications]], in which the [[multiplicand]] is represented in the right column, the multiplier in the two central columns and the result ([[product (mathematics)|product]]) is shown in the left column. See the following table.

||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|-
||&lt;small&gt;ooooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;ooo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;oo&lt;/small&gt;
||&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;
|}
|}

The theory differs from all the previous by several aspects: first, the white and black circles would not be any gaps that may be filled with a seed, but different colors of the seeds, representatives respectively tens and units (this according to the chronicler Juan de Velasco ).&lt;ref name="VEL" /&gt;

Secondly, the multiplicand is entered in the first column respecting the sign-value notation: so, the seeds can be entered in any order and the number is given by the sum of the values of these seeds.

The multiplier is represented as the sum of two factors, since the procedure for obtaining the product is based on the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The table multiplier drawn by Poma de Ayala with that provision of the seeds, represent according to the author, the calculation: 32 x 5, where the multiplier 5 is decomposed into 3 + 2. The sequence of numbers 1,2,3,5 would be casual, contingent to the calculation done and not related to the Fibonacci series.

!| 151(160)||96||64||32

Key: o = 10; • = 1; The operation represented is: 32 x 5 = 32 x (2 + 3) = (32 x 2) + (32 x 3) = 64 + 96 = 160

The numbers represented in the columns are, from left to right: 32 (the multiplicand), 64 = 32 x 2 and 32 x 3 = 96 (which together constitute the multiplicand, multiplied by the two factors in which the multiplier has been broken down) and finally 151. In this issue (error) are based all possible criticisms of this interpretation, since 151 is obviously not the sum of 96 and 64. Florio, however, notes that a mistake of Poma de Ayala, in designing a black circle instead of a white one, would have been possible. In this case, changing just a black circle with a white one in the last column, we obtain the number 160, which is exactly the product sought as the sum of the quantities present in the central columns.

With a yupana as the one designed by Poma de Ayala can not be represented every multiplicands, but it is necessary to extend the yupana vertically (adding rows) to represent numbers whose sum of digits exceeds 5. The same thing goes for the multipliers: to represent all the numbers is necessary to extend the number of columns. It should be emphasized that this interpretation, apart the supposed error calculation  (or representation by the designer), is the only one that identifies in the yupana of Poma de Ayala a mathematical and consistent message (multiplication) and not a series of random numbers as in other interpretations.

In [[game theory]], '''Zermelo’s theorem''', named after [[Ernst Zermelo]], says that in any finite two-person game of [[perfect information]] in which the players move alternatingly and in which chance does not affect the decision making process, if the game cannot end in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning strategy (i.e. force a win). It can alternately be stated as saying that in such a game, either the first-player can force a win, or the second-player can force a win, or both players can force a draw.&lt;ref name=Schwalbe&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwalbe |first1=Ulrich |last2=Walker |first2=Paul |title=Zermelo and the Early History of Game Theory |url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/FS23j.03/zermelo.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusions of Zermelo's theorem ==
Zermelo's work shows that in two-person [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum]] games with perfect information, if a player is in a winning position, then he can always force a win no matter what strategy the other player may employ. Furthermore, and as a consequence, if a player is in a winning position, it will never require more moves than there are positions in the game (with a position defined as position of pieces as well as the player next to move).&lt;ref name=Schwalbe/&gt;

== Publication history ==

Zermelo's original paper describing the theorem,
''Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'', was published in German in 1913. Ulrich Schwalbe and Paul Walker translated Zermelo's paper into English in 1997 and published the translation in the appendix to ''Zermelo and the Early History of Game Theory''.&lt;ref name=Schwalbe/&gt;

== Details ==

Zermelo considers the class of two-person games without chance, where players have strictly opposing interests and where only a finite number of positions are possible. Although in the game only finitely many positions are possible, Zermelo allows infinite sequences of moves since he does not consider stopping rules. Thus, he allows for the possibility of infinite games. Then he addresses two problems:

# What does it mean for a player to be in a 'winning' position and is it possible to define this in an objective mathematical manner?
# If he is in a winning position, can the number of moves needed to force the win be determined?

To answer the first question, Zermelo states that a necessary and sufficient condition is the nonemptyness of a certain set, containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player wins independently of how the other player plays. But should this set be empty, the best a player could achieve would be a draw. So he defines another set containing all possible sequences of moves such that a player can postpone his loss for an infinite number of moves, which implies a draw. This set may also be empty, i. e., the player can avoid his loss for only finitely many moves if his opponent plays correctly. But this is equivalent to the opponent being able to force a win. This is the basis for all modern versions of Zermelo's theorem.

About the second question, Zermelo claimed that it will never take more moves than there are positions in the game. His proof is a [[proof by contradiction]]: Assume that a player can win in a number of moves larger than the number of positions. Of course, at least one winning position must have appeared twice. So the player could have played at the first occurrence in the same way as he does at the second and thus could have won in fewer moves than there are positions.

== Example ==

When applied to [[chess]], Zermelo's Theorem states "either [[White and Black in chess|White]] can force a win, or Black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacQuarrie |first=John |title=Mathematics and Chess |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Projects/MacQuarrie/Chapters/Ch4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aumann |first=R.
