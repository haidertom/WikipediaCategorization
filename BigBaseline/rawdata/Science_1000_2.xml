If the research is high-quality, certain to be beneficial, and not going to inflict suffering, then it will fall into the hollow section (top front) meaning research should proceed.   Painful, low-quality research with lower likelihood of success will be lower back in the solid area, and should not proceed.  Most research will not be clear-cut, but the guiding principle is 'hollow' should continue, 'solid' should not.]]
'''Bateson's cube''' is a model of the [[cost–benefit analysis]] for [[animal research]] developed by Professor [[Patrick Bateson]], president of the [[Zoological Society of London]]. &lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson, When to experiment on animals. New Scientist, 109 (1986), pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson, P. Biggs, A. Cuthbert, I. Cuthill, M. Festing, E.B. Keverne, S. King, C. Page, O. Petersen, N. Rothwell, M. Rushworth, V. Walsh, O. Roberts. The Use of Non-human Animals in Research: a Guide for Scientists. The Royal Society, Policy Document 01/04 The Royal Society, London (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson's cube evaluates proposed research through three criteria:

* the degree of animal suffering,
* the quality of the research,
* the potential medical benefit.

Bateson suggested that research that does not meet these requirements should not be approved or performed, in accordance with the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]]. It is not intended as a formal model for optimal trade-offs, but rather a tool for making judicial decisions, since the three axes are not in a common currency.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson. Ethics and behavioural biology. Advances in the Study of Behavior, 35 (2005), pp. 211–233&lt;/ref&gt; The third criterion also does not necessarily have to be medical benefit, but could be a wider form of utility. &lt;ref&gt;[[Innes C. Cuthill]], Ethical regulation and animal science: why animal behaviour is not so special. Animal Behaviour. Volume 74, Issue 1, July 2007, Pages 15–22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20056">A '''biomedical scientist'''&lt;!--- do not list all possible alternate titles here. biomedical scientist is sufficient. ---&gt; is a [[scientist]] trained in [[biology]], particularly in the context of [[medicine]]. These scientists work to gain knowledge on the main principles of how the human body works and to find new ways to cure or treat [[disease]] by developing advanced [[diagnostic test|diagnostic tools]] or new [[therapy|therapeutic strategies]]. The [[research]] of biomedical scientists is referred to as [[biomedical research]].

== Description ==
The specific activities of the biomedical scientist can differ in various parts of the world and vary with the level of education. Generally speaking, biomedical scientists conduct research in a [[laboratory]] setting, using living organisms as [[model organism|models]] to conduct [[experiment]]s. These can include [[cell culture|cultured human or animal cells]] grown outside of the whole organism, small animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|flies]], [[Caenorhabditis elegans|worms]], [[zebrafish|fish]], [[House mouse|mice]], and [[Brown rat|rat]]s, or, rarely, larger animals and [[primate]]s. Biomedical scientists may also work directly with human tissue specimens to perform experiments as well as participate in [[clinical research]].

Biomedical scientists employ a variety of techniques in order to carry out laboratory experiments. These include:
*Molecular and biochemical techniques
**[[Electrophoresis]] and [[Blot (biology)|blotting]]
**[[Immunostaining]]
**[[Chromatography]]
**[[Mass spectrometry]]
**[[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and [[sequencing]]
**[[Microarray]]s
*Imaging technologies
**[[Optical microscope|Light]], [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence]], and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]
**[[MRI]]
**[[Positron emission tomography|PET]]
**[[radiography|X-ray]]
*[[Gene]]tic engineering/modification
**[[Transfection]]
**[[Transduction (genetics)|Viral transduction]]
**[[Transgenic organisms|Transgenic model organisms]]
*[[Electrophysiology]] techniques
**[[Patch clamp]]
**[[EEG]], [[EKG]], [[Electroretinography|ERG]]
*''[[In silico]]'' techniques
**[[Bioinformatics]]
**[[Computational biology]]

===Level of education===
Biomedical scientists typically obtain a bachelor of science degree, and usually take postgraduate studies leading to a diploma, master or doctorate. This degree is necessary for faculty positions at academic institutions, as well as senior scientist positions at most companies. Some biomedical scientists also possess a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy|PharmD]], Doctor of Medical Laboratory Sciences[MLSD], MBBS, etc.) in addition to an academic degree.

===Work environment===

====Academics====
This category includes [[tenure]]d [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] positions at [[university|universities]], [[college]]s, non-profit [[research institute]]s, and sometimes [[hospital]]s. These positions usually afford more intellectual freedom and give the researcher more latitude in the direction and content of the research. Scientists in academic settings, in addition to conducting experiments, will also attend [[academic conference|scientific conferences]], compete for [[funding of science|research grant funding]], publish [[scientific journal|scientific papers]], and teach classes.

====Industry====
Industry jobs refer to private sector jobs at for-profit corporations. In the case of biomedical scientists, employment is usually at large [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] or [[biotechnology]] companies. Positions in industry tend to pay higher salaries than those at academic institutions, but job security compared to tenured academic faculty is significantly less. Researchers in industry tend to have less intellectual freedom in their research than those in the academic sector, owing to the ultimate goal of producing marketable products that benefit the company.

====Non-traditional career paths====
In recent years, more biomedical scientists have pursued careers where advanced education and experience in biomedical research is needed outside of traditional laboratory research. These areas include [[patent law]], [[consultant|consulting]], [[public policy]], and [[science journalism]].  The primary reason for growth in these areas is that in recent years fewer positions are available in traditional academic research relative to the number of seekers; approximately 15-20% of PhD life scientists will obtain a tenure-track position or lab-head position in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf |title=The Scientific Workforce Policy Debate: Do We Produce too Many Biomedical Trainees? |accessdate=19 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206081936/http://hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
"Biomedical scientist" is the protected title used by professionals qualified to work unsupervised within the [[pathology]] department of a [[hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biomedical Scientist as Expert Witness |author= Paul D. Ellner|year= 2006|publisher=ASM Press|isbn=1-55581-345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biomedical science]]s are made up of the following disciplines; [[biochemistry]], [[haematology]], [[immunology]], [[microbiology]], [[histology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], and [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] services. These professions are regulated within the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]]. Anyone who falsely claims to be a biomedical scientist commits an offence and could be [[Fine (penalty)|fined]] up to [[Pound sterling|£]]5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/|title=HCPC - Health and Care Professions Council  - Protected titles|website=www.hcpc-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each department specialises in aiding the [[diagnosis]] and treatment of disease. Entry to the profession requires an [[Institute of Biomedical Science]] (IBMS) accredited [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] [[honours degree]] followed by a minimum of 12 months [[laboratory]] training in one of the pathology disciplines, however the actual time spent training can be considerably longer. Trainees are also required to complete a certificate of competence training portfolio, this requires gathering extensive amounts of evidence to demonstrate professional competence. At the end of this period the trainees portfolio and overall competence are assessed; if successful, a certificate of competence is awarded, which can be used to apply for registration with the HCPC. State registration indicates that the applicant has reached a required standard of education and will follow the guidelines and codes of practice created by the Health and Care Professions Council. The NHS, the largest employer of Biomedical Scientist, now run the 'Practitioners Training Program' in conjunction with several Universities which includes a years experienced as a part of a 3-year degree. This is known as BSc Healthcare Science (Life Science) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/ptp-join/nhs-practitioner-training-programme|title=NHS Practitioner Training Programme|first=Super|last=User|website=www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biomedical Scientists are the second largest profession registered by the Health and Care Professions Council and make up a vital component of the health care team. Many of the decisions doctors make are based on the test results generated by Biomedical Scientists. Despite this, much of the general public are unaware of Biomedical Scientists and the important role they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/biomedical_scientist_job_description.htm|title=Biomedical scientist job profile - Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical Scientists are not confined to [[National Health Service|NHS]] laboratories. Biomedical Scientists along with scientists in other inter-related medical disciplines seek out to understand human anatomy, genetics, immunology, physiology and behaviour at all levels. This is sometimes achieved through the use of model systems that are homologous to various aspects of human biology. The research that is carried out either in Universities or Pharmaceutical companies by Biomedical Scientists has led to the development of new treatments for a wide range of degenerative and genetic disorders. [[Stem cell]] biology, [[cloning]], [[genetic testing|genetic screening]]/therapies and other areas of biomedical science have all been generated by the work of Biomedical Scientists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibms.org|title=Home|website=Institute of Biomedical Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Biomedical science graduate programs are maintained at academic institutions and medical schools around the world, and some biomedical graduate programs are administered jointly by an academic institution and a business, hospital, or independent research institute. While [[graduate students]] historically committed to a particular research specialty, such as [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[developmental biology]], the recent trend (particularly in the United States) is to offer interdisciplinary programs that do not specialize and instead aim to incorporate a broad education in multiple biological disciplines.

Initially, graduate students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, after which the student commits to joining a particular laboratory for the remainder of his or her education. The remaining time is spent conducting original research under the direction of the [[principal investigator]] to complete and publish a [[dissertation]]. Unlike undergraduate and [[professional schools]], there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/bbs/admissions/faq.aspx#FAQ13
 |title=Admission FAQS for The Basic and Biomedical Sciences Division of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at UMass Medical School, Worcester |accessdate=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical scientists typically study in undergraduate majors that are focused on biological sciences, such as [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[zoology]], [[biophysics]], etc.

=== United Kingdom ===
Education programmes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibms.org/go/education-development:ibms-courses&lt;/ref&gt; have traditionally encompassed an initial [[bachelor's degree]], which is presupposed for two years of further studies eventually earning the students a ''medicine master's examina''. Many students choose to study on (for as much as) another 4 years to earn a PhD degree, at this time the students specialize in a certain areas such as [[nephrology]], [[neurology]], [[oncology]] or [[virology]].

In the UK specifically, prospective undergraduate students wishing to undertake a BSc in biomedical sciences are required to apply via the [[UCAS]] application system (usually during the final year of college or sixth form secondary school). A [[Doctor of Science|PhD in Biomedicine]] is however required for most higher [[research]] and [[teacher|teaching]] positions, which most [[college]]s and [[universities]] offer.&lt;ref name="WiHC"/&gt; These [[graduate degree]] programs may include [[classroom]] and [[fieldwork]], research at a [[laboratory]], and a [[dissertation]]. Although a degree in a [[medicine]] or [[biology]] (biochemistry, microbiology, zoology, biophysics) is common, recent research [[project]]s also need graduates in [[statistics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Abilities preferred for entry in this field include: technical, scientific, numerical, written, and oral [[skill]]s.

University departments offering degree programmes and/or research in biomedical sciences are represented by the Heads of University Centres of Biomedical Sciences (HUCBMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hucbms.org/|title=Heads of University Centres of Biomedical Sciences (HUCBMS)|website=www.hucbms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. HUCBMS has an international membership.

== Areas of specialization ==
Biomedical scientists can focus on several areas of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]],&lt;ref name="WiHC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wihealthcareers.org/Career_occ_view.cfm?o_id=62 |title=Health Careers |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929215035/http://wihealthcareers.org/Career_occ_view.cfm?o_id=62 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

*[[Biochemistry]]: studies the [[chemical]] composition of [[cell (biology)|cells]], and in serum/plasma, and the chemistry behind biological processes
*[[Molecular biology]]: studies the [[molecular]] makeup and processes of living [[organisms]]
*[[Biophysics]]: studies [[Mechanical energy|mechanical]] and [[Electrical energy|electrical]] [[energy]] in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s
*[[Cell biology]]: studies cell-level organization and processes
*[[Cytopathology]]: Studies cell obtained by different means from human and sometimes animal bodies, using microscope and recent technologies to evaluate morphology, molecular pathology changes by molecular diagnostics. Also cytopathology involves cancer screening such cervical, breast, colon and prostate cancers.
*[[Computational biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]]: uses [[computer simulation|computer modeling]] and [[data analysis]] to understand biological systems
*[[Developmental biology]]: studies the growth and development of organisms and focuses on diseases of abnormal development
*[[Epidemiology]]: studies the incidence and transmission of diseases in a [[population]] and population characteristics ([[Human behavior|behaviors]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], etc.) that associate with diseases
*[[Genetics]]: studies [[DNA]] and [[gene]]s of [[human]]s and animals, as well as diseases caused by abnormal or [[mutation|mutated]] DNA.
*[[Haematology]]: studies of the [[blood]], such as [[blood cell]]s, and mechanisms of [[coagulation]].
*[[Blood Transfusion]]: studies of transfusion science (although frequently linked to haematology, it is however a specialist discipline in its own right). 
*[[Histopathology]]: Studies tissues for disease diagnosis, using histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical analysis or molecular genetic techniques for diagnostics.
*[[Immunology]]: studies the [[immune system]]
*[[Microbiology]]: studies characteristics of [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and their role in human health
*[[Neuroscience]]: studies on function and structure the [[nervous system]], including the [[brain]]
*[[Oncology]] (a.k.a. cancer biology): studies the causes and characteristics of [[cancer]]
*[[Parasitology]]: studies [[parasite]]s
*[[Pathology]]: studies the underlying causes and bodily effects of disease through examination of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, and cells
*[[Pharmacology]]: studies effects of [[drug]]s on biological systems
*[[Physiology]]: studies how various [[body system]]s function at macroscopic, microscopic and molecular levels
*[[Virology]]: studies [[virus]]es and viral diseases
*[[Medicinal chemistry|Medicinal Chemistry]]: studies compound for medicinal usage
 
However, recent trends in biomedical graduate education (particularly in the United States) are for biomedical scientists to remain interdisciplinary and to not specialize. This approach emphasizes focus on a particular body or disease process as a whole and drawing upon the techniques of multiple specialties. (''See also: [[Systems biology]]'')

== Salaries and job growth ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the salaries for biomedical scientists range from £21,692 to £67,805&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/working-in-the-nhs/pay-and-benefits/agenda-for-change-pay-rates/|title=Agenda for change - pay rates|date=22 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus high cost area supplements and out of hours payments, depending on experience, education, and position. Job growth for the profession has been forecasted as follows:

===United States of America===
According to the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), the 2010-2011 occupational outlook report suggests that biomedical scientist employment is expected "to increase 40 percent over the 2008-18 decade, much faster than the average for all occupations."&lt;ref name='BLS'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos309.htm|title=Medical Scientists - US Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2010 BLS report, the median salaries for biomedical scientists in the United States in particular employment areas are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"

&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this mode of [[science]] argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in [[genetics]] and [[stem cell]] biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope. Because of the inherently uncertain [[return on investment]], blue-sky projects are politically and commercially unpopular and tend to lose funding to more reliably profitable or practical research.&lt;ref name="times 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article568223.ece|title=Politics clouds blue-sky science|work=The Times|date=September 19, 2005  | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Mark | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for blue skies research has varied over time, ultimately becoming subject to the political process, in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundation.org.uk/|title=To what extent should UK funding for science and innovation be focussed?|work=Foundation for Science and Technology  |accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India. [[Vannevar Bush]]'s 1945 report, ''[https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm Science: The Endless Frontier]'', made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 launch of [[Sputnik]] prompted the United States [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]] to sponsor blue skies research into the 1960s.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the [[Netherlands]], and by the 1990s in [[Germany]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"/&gt;

In 1980, [[British Petroleum]] (known as BP after 2000) established a blue skies research initiative called the Venture Research Unit, headed by particle physicist [[Donald Braben]]. Braben controversially challenged [[peer review]] as the mechanism for establishing funding, emphasizing the selection of researchers whose proposals "could radically change the way we think about something important."&lt;ref name=" review 2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Mark Walport]], director of the [[Wellcome Trust]] and former Professor of Medicine at [[Imperial College, London]] warned that excessive emphasis on agenda-driven research could jeopardise serendipitous advances in science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government is right to recognise the importance of science and technology, but I think it is a mistake to try to [[wikt:ringfence|ring-fence]] funds. There is a serious danger that we will spend money on projects that are less good. It is absolutely key that funding is used to support the best scientists with the best ideas.&lt;ref name="times 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When UK [[research council]]s introduced a requirement that grant application include a 2-page statement on the economic impact of the proposed work, 20 scientists, including 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel laureate]] [[Harold Kroto]], wrote a public letter to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' condemning the requirement and calling for peer reviewers to ignore the additional documentation.&lt;ref name="sciencemag blog"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grants and conferences==

[[The Royal Society]] grants up to 1 million [[pounds sterling]] annually in ''Theo Murphy Blue Skies awards'' to fund "research which is considered to be original and exciting but lacks a sufficient evidence base in the literature to be supported by traditional grant schemes."&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK-based [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) operates a program called the IDEAS Factory, intended to promote "blue sky, curiosity-led research."&lt;ref name="nottingham"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) holds a "Blue Sky Forum" every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|title=Blue Sky II 2006|work=Statistics Canada|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116125256/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjects ==

Owing to its radical nature, blue sky science may challenge accepted [[Paradigm#Scientific paradigm|scientific paradigms]] and introduce entirely new fields of study.&lt;ref name="linden 2008"/&gt; It has been the inspiration for numerous works of [[science fiction]]. It has sometimes been concerned with topics such as unexplained phenomena and the impact of future technologies upon society, asking questions such as "How would a spacecraft traverse a [[black hole]] and where would it arrive upon leaving it?" and "Will the universe end, or will it just expand ever outwards for eternity?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">The '''British Society for Social Responsibility in Science (BSSRS)''' was a radical science movement most active in the 1970s. It was formed in 1968 in opposition to university research on chemical and biological weapons, and supported by 83 distinguished scientists, including [[William Lawrence Bragg|William Bragg]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Nobel laureate [[Maurice Wilkins]] was the founding President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Society for Social Responsibility in Science |url=https://www.artscatalyst.org/artist/british-society-social-responsibility-science |website=Arts Catalyst |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main aims of the BSSRS was to raise awareness of the social responsibilities of scientists, the political aspect of science and technology, and to create an informed public.
 
==Details==
Among groups that were particularly active in BSSRS were members of
* Scientists against the Bomb
* The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND)
*[[Radical Statistics]]
*the [[Open University]]
* the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE)

BSSRS's inaugural meeting, sponsored by 64 Fellows, was held at the [[Royal Society]], and attended by more
than 300, mostly UK, scientists and engineers. Professor [[Maurice Wilkins]]
was the founding President (1969–91).&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]] 9 August 1975, pp 329&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups first targets was the [[British Science Association]]. At a meeting of the BSA in Durham in 1970, they raised political issues under a banner of "Science is not neutral". They continued their stance against the BSA, claiming it served a "propagandist function".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beneath the white coat: the radical science movement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/18/beneath-white-coat-radical-science-movement |website=Guardian Newspaper |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSSRS published a newssheet (1969–72), continued by Science for People, (1972/3), and also had local societies and organized public meetings, as well as publishing longer research monographs.

'''''Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science''''' is a 1979 book by astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]]. Its chapters were originally articles published between 1974 and 1979 in various magazines, including ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Physics Today]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Scientific American]]''.  In the introduction, Sagan wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science|first=Carl|last=Sagan|origyear=1979|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]]|page=xiii|isbn=9780307800992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYpP6zmD9G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22broca's%20brain%22&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|As long as there have been human beings, we have posed the deep and fundamental questions...If we don't destroy ourselves, most of us will be around for the answers...  By far the most exciting, satisfying and exhilarating time to be alive is the time in which we pass from ignorance to knowledge on these fundamental issues.|p. xiii}}

==Title==
The title essay is named in honor of the French [[physician]], [[anatomist]] and [[anthropologist]], [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880). He is best known for his discovery that different functions are assigned to different parts of the brain. He believed that by studying the brains of cadavers and correlating the known experiences of the former owners of the organs, human behavior could eventually be discovered and understood. To that end, he saved hundreds of human brains in jars of [[formalin]]; among the collection is his own neural organ. When Sagan finds it in [[Musée de l'Homme]], he poses questions that challenge some core ideas of human existence such as "How much of that man known as Paul Broca can still be found in this jar?"—a question that evokes both [[Religion|religious]] and [[Science|scientific]] argument.

==Contents==

A major part of the book is devoted to debunking "paradoxers" who either live at the edge of science or are outright [[charlatan]]s. An example of this is the controversy surrounding [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ideas presented in the book ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. Another large part of the book discusses naming conventions for the members of our solar system and their physical features. Sagan also discusses [[Science fiction]] at some length. Here, he mentions [[Robert A. Heinlein]] as being one of his favorite science fiction authors in his childhood. [[Near death experience]]s and their cultural ambiguity is another topic of the essays. Sagan also criticizes ideas developed in [[Robert K. G. Temple]]'s book ''[[The Sirius Mystery]]'', published three years earlier in 1975.

In the final section of the book, "Ultimate Questions." Sagan writes:
{{quote|...My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, our curiosity and intelligence were provided by such a god...on the other hand if such a god does not exist then our curiosity and intelligence are the essential tools for survival. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is essential for the welfare of the human species.}}

A '''computational scientist''' is a person skilled in [[scientific computing]]. This person is usually a [[scientist]], an [[engineer]], or an applied mathematician who applies [[high-performance computing|high-performance computers]] in different ways to advance the state-of-the-art in their respective applied disciplines; [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[social sciences]] and so forth. Thus scientific computing has increasingly influenced many areas such as economics, biology, law and medicine to name a few.

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |year=2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit |title=Tools for Excellent Papers: 2014 ASPA Student Summit |publisher=[[Texas State University]] |location=[[Washington D.C.]]}} Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint depicts the connection between football and conceptual frameworks in the context of a large graduate student paper. The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Whetsell |first2=Travis |year=2017 |chapter=Public Administration Methodology: A Pragmatic Perspective |editor-last1=Raadshelders |editor-first1=Jos |editor-last2=Stillman |editor-first2=Richard |title=Foundations of Public Administration |pages=75–92 |publisher=Melvin and Leigh |isbn=978-0-9973-0842-6 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311511761_Public_Administration_Methodology_A_Pragmatic_Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and line up with a research purpose in the following ways:
* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]].

'''''Cosmic Jackpot''''', also published under the title '''''The Goldilocks Enigma: Why is the Universe Just Right for Life?''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9hxsTybfLWsC Google Books: The Goldilocks Enigma]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2007 non-fiction book by physicist and cosmologist [[Paul Davies]], describing the idea of a [[fine-tuned Universe]].

==The Enigma==
{{main article|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In ''Cosmic Jackpot'', Davies argues that certain universal [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] are precisely adjusted to make life in the Universe possible: that we have, in a sense, won a "cosmic [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]]," and that conditions are "just right" for life, as in [[The Story of the Three Bears]]. As Davies writes elsewhere, "There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the universe is in several respects 'fine-tuned' for life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Davies]], "How bio-friendly is the universe?" ''International Journal of Astrobiology, vol. 2, no. 2 (2003): 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

After explaining this enigma, Davies discusses possible solutions, such as the [[anthropic principle]], the idea of a [[multiverse]] which contains many different universes (including our "just right" one), and the idea of [[intelligent design]].

==The Multiverse==
{{main article|Multiverse}}
Davies also discusses a number of other ideas connected with the "[[multiverse]]." Much like a pencil falling to the ground from its tip in a trade off of symmetry for stability, Davies writes that the Big Bang could have established a complex but stable universe (or multiverse) from [[symmetry breaking]] as the heat radiation in "space" lowered abruptly past the [[Curie Point]].

'''Cryo-Electron Microscopy''' ('''Cryo-EM''') is an [[electron microscopy]] (EM) technique applied on samples cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures and embedded in an environment of vitreous water. An aqueous sample solution is applied to a grid-mesh and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. While development of the technique began in the 1970s, recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng Y, Grigorieff N, Penczek PA, Walz T | title = A primer to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 3 | pages = 438–449 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25910204 | pmc = 4409659 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[NMR spectroscopy]] for macromolecular structure determination without the need for crystallization.

In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to [[Jacques Dubochet]], [[Joachim Frank]], and [[Richard Henderson (biologist)|Richard Henderson]] "for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History of Cryogenic Electron Microscopy ==
In the 1960s, scientist were faced with the issue of structure determination methods using electron microscopy damaging the specimen due to high energy electron beams, so cryogenic electron microscopy was considered to overcome this issue as it was expected that low temperatures would reduce beam damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubochet J, Knapek E | title = Ups and downs in early electron cryo-microscopy | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = e2005550 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29672565 | pmc = 5929567 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | url = https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Erwin Knapek and Jacques Dubochet published commenting on beam damage at cryogenic temperatures sharing observations that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thin crystals mounted on carbon film were found to be from 30 to 300 times more beam-resistant at 4 K than at room temperature... Most of our results can be explained by assuming that cryoprotection in the region of 4 K is strongly dependent on the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knapek E, Dubochet J | title = Beam damage to organic material is considerably reduced in cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–61 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 7441748 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(80)90382-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, these results were not reproducible and amendments were published in the Nature international journal of science just 2 years later informing that the beam resistance was less significant than initially anticipated. The protection gained at 4 K was closer to “tenfold for standard samples of L-valine,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/299386c0.pdf|title=Cryo-transmission microscopy Fading hopes|last=Newmark|first=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=30 September 1982|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; than what was previously stated.

In 2017, three scientists, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a technique that would image biomolecules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressey D, Callaway E | title = Cryo-electron microscopy wins chemistry Nobel | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | issue = 7675 | pages = 167 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29022937 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.22738 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/cryo-electron-microscopy-wins-chemistry-nobel-1.22738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chemists realized that electron diffraction can be used to readily determine the structures of small molecules that form needle-like crystals, structures that would otherwise need to be determined from X-ray crystallography, by growing larger crystals of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gruene T, Wennmacher JT, Zaubitzer C, Holstein JJ, Heidler J, Fecteau-Lefebvre A, De Carlo S, Müller E, Goldie KN, Regeni I, Li T, Santiso-Quinones G, Steinfeld G, Handschin S, van Genderen E, van Bokhoven JA, Clever GH, Pantelic R | title = Rapid structure determination of microcrystalline molecular compounds using electron diffraction | journal = Angewandte Chemie | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30325568 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201811318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">A '''data janitor''' is a person who works to take [[big data]] and condense it into useful amounts of information. Also known as a "data wrangler," a data janitor sifts through data for companies in the [[information technology]] industry. A multitude of [[startup company|start-ups]] rely on large amounts of data, so a data janitor works to help these businesses with this basic, but difficult process of interpreting data.

While it is a commonly held belief that data janitor work is fully automated, many data scientists are employed primarily as data janitors. The Information technology industry has been increasingly turning towards new sources of data gathered on [[consumers]], so data janitors have become more commonplace in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data janitors work in a process that largely consists of four steps: selection and defining relationships, extraction and organization, loading, and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Big Data, Preparing Data is Most of the Work|url=http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/in-big-data-preparing-the-data-is-most-of-the-work|website=Data Science Central|publisher=Sullexis LLC|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data janitors identify sources of data before selecting which data is relevant and find the relationships between the data that will be useful to the company's projects. Next, they structure the data in an effort to extract the information and put it into a format that can be stored in a secure place for the business. Last, the data janitors work with other employees to create [[Presentation program|visual aids]] to present to managers and executives who will eventually benefit from the conclusions that can be made from them. In this way, the work of data janitors is integral to the functioning of businesses that rely on large amounts data to function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "A measure of the relative contributions of temperature and salinity in determining the density gradient in a seawater column" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">{{short description|A measure of the relative contributions of temperature and salinity in determining the density gradient in a seawater column}}
The '''density ratio''' of a column of [[seawater]] is a measure of the relative contributions of [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] in determining the [[density]] gradient.&lt;ref&gt;You, Yuzhu. "A global ocean climatological atlas of the Turner angle: implications for double-diffusion and water-mass structure." Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 49.11 (2002): 2075-2093.&lt;/ref&gt; At a density ratio of 1, temperature and salinity are said to be ''compensated'': their density signatures cancel, leaving a density gradient of zero.  The formula for the density ratio, R, is:

R = αθ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;/βS&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, where

* θ is the [[potential temperature]]
* S is the salinity
* z is the vertical coordinate (with subscript denoting [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] by z)
* ρ is the density
* α = −ρ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;∂ρ/∂θ is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] 
* β = ρ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;∂ρ/∂S is the haline contraction coefficient

When a water column is "doubly stable"--both temperature and salinity contribute to the stable density gradient--the density ratio is negative (a doubly unstable water column would also have a negative density ratio, but does not commonly occur).  A statically stable water column with a density ratio between 0 and 1 (cool fresh overlying warm salty) can support [[diffusive convection]], and a statically stable water column with a density ratio larger than 1 can support [[salt fingering]].

Density ratio may also be used to describe thermohaline variability over a non-vertical spatial interval, such as across a [[front (oceanography)|front]] in the [[mixed layer]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick, Daniel L., and Raffaele Ferrari. "Compensation of horizontal temperature and salinity gradients in the ocean mixed layer." Science 283.5401 (1999): 526-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the signs of both the numerator and denominator are reversed, the density ratio remains unchanged. A related quantity which avoids this ambiguity as well as the infinite values possible when the denominator vanishes is the Turner angle, Tu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Turner_angle American Meteorological Society Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

(1953). "The Eisenbud-Pederson-Krag-Fodor-Ellis Controversy". In ''Psychoanalysis and the Occult''. Oxford, England: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific evidence that dream telepathy is a real phenomenon. [[Parapsychology|Parapsychological]] experiments into dream telepathy have not produced replicable results.&lt;ref name ="Wiseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansel1989&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited''. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-152. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The notion and speculation of communication via dreaming was first mooted in psychoanalysis by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=Eshel&gt;Eshel, Ofra (December 2006). "Where are you, my beloved?: On absence, loss, and the enigma of telepathic dreams". ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 87 (6): 1603–1627.&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a model to express his ideas about telepathic dreaming.&lt;ref name=ullmanweb/&gt;  His 1922 paper ''Dreams and Telepathy'' is reproduced in the book ''Psychoanalysis and the Occult'' (1953) and was intended to be a lecture to the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society, although he never delivered it.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt; Freud considered that a connection between telepathy and dreams could be neither proven nor disproven.  He was distinctly suspicious of the whole idea, noting that he himself had never had a telepathic dream. (His two dreams that were potentially telepathic, where he dreamed of the deaths of a son and of a sister-in-law, which did not occur, he labeled as "purely subjective anticipations".) His ideas were not widely accepted at the time, but he continued to publicly express his interest and findings about telepathic dreaming. He also observed that he had not encountered any evidence of dream telepathy in his patients.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieden, Ken (1990). ''Freud's dream of interpretation''. SUNY series in modern Jewish literature and culture. SUNY Press. pp. 102-103. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0124-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud claims neutrality about the phenomenon itself, states that the sleep milieu has special likely properties for it if it does exist, and discounts all of the cases presented to him on standard psychoanalytic grounds (e.g. neurosis, transference, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. Collected Papers, V. IV pp 408-435 International Psychoanalytic Library No. 7, Ed 1, Basic Books 1959 ''"Have I given you the impression that I am secretly inclined to support the reality of telepathy in the occult sense? If so, I should very much regret that it is so difficult to avoid giving such an impression. In reality, however, I was anxious to be strictly impartial. I have every reason to be so, for I have no opinion; I know nothing about it."'' p. 435. Here Freud explicitly refers to the conflation of telepathy as such with clairvoyance and other occult elements&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s [[Jule Eisenbud]], Geraldine Pederson-Krag and [[Nandor Fodor]] described alleged cases of dream telepathy. [[Albert Ellis]] regarded their conclusions to have been based upon flimsy evidence, and that they could be better explained by bias, [[coincidence]] and unconscious cues than by dream telepathy. He also accused them of an emotional involvement in the notion, resulting in their observations and judgement being clouded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Ellis|Ellis, Albert]]. (1947). ''Telepathy and Psychoanalysis: A Critique of Recent Findings''. Psychiatric Quarterly 21: 607-659.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Ellis|Ellis, Albert]]. (1949). ''Re-analysis of an alleged telepathic dream''. Psychiatric Quarterly: 23: 116-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist L. Börje Löfgren also criticised dream telepathy experiments of Eisenbud. He stated that coincidence was a more likely explanation and the "assumption of paranormal forces to explain them is unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;Löfgren, L. B. (1968). ''Recent Publications on Parapsychology''. ''[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]]'' 16: 146-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
[[File:Montague Ullman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Montague Ullman]] was notable for conducting dream telepathy experiments. His results were never replicated.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2014). ''Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep''. Macmillan. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-1-4472-4840-8}} Wiseman writes regarding Krippner and Ullman's experiments "Over the years, many researchers have failed to replicate their remarkable findings and, as a result, the work is seen as curious but not proof of the paranormal."&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There have been many experiments done to test the validity of dream telepathy and its effectiveness, but with significant issues of blinding. Many test subjects find ways to communicate with others to make it look like telepathic communication. Attempts to cut off communication between the agent, sender, and receiver of information failed because subjects found ways to get around blindfolds no matter how intricate and covering they were.&lt;ref&gt;McBroom, Patricia. (1967). ''Dreams, Art and Mental Telepathy''. Science News 92: 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In studies at the [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] led by [[Stanley Krippner]] and [[Montague Ullman]], patients were monitored and awakened after a period of REM then separated to study the claimed ability to communicate telepathically. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy.&lt;ref name=ullmanweb /&gt;

The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by [[C. E. M. Hansel]]. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed; however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M.]] ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level.&lt;ref&gt;Belvedere, E., Foulkes, D. (1971). ''Telepathy and Dreams: A Failure to Replicate''. Perceptual and Motor Skills 33: 783–789.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.&lt;ref name=Hansel1989/&gt;

In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, S. J; Roe, C. A. (2003). ''A Review of Dream ESP Studies Conducted Since the Maimonides Dream ESP Programme''. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 10: 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[James Alcock]] noted that their review was based on "extreme messiness" of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and "lack of replication is rampant."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock|Alcock, James]]. (2003). ''Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi''. Journal of Consciousness Studies 10: 29-50. "In their article, Sherwood and Roe examine attempts to replicate the well-known Maimonides dream studies that began in the 1960s. They provide a good review of these studies of dream telepathy and clairvoyance, but if one thing emerges for me from their review, it is the extreme messiness of the data adduced. Lack of replication is rampant. While one would normally expect that continuing scientific scrutiny of a phenomenon should lead to stronger effect sizes as one learns more about the subject matter and refines the methodology, this is apparently not the case with this research."&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist and noted skeptic [[Richard Wiseman]] took part in a dream telepathy experiment. It was conducted by [[Caroline Watt]] at a sleep laboratory in an attempt to replicate the results of Krippner and Ullman. The experiment was a complete failure. According to Wiseman "after monitoring about twenty volunteers for several nights on end, the study didn't discover any evidence in support of the supernatural."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2014). ''Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep''. Macmillan. pp. 200-201. {{ISBN|978-1-4472-4840-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">In science, an '''effective theory''' is a [[scientific theory]] which proposes to describe a certain set of [[Experiment|observations]],  but explicitly without the claim or implication that the mechanism employed in the theory has a direct counterpart in the actual causes of the observed phenomena to which the theory is fitted.
I.e. the theory proposes to model a certain ''effect'', without proposing to adequately model any of the ''causes'' which contribute to the effect.

Thus, an [[effective field theory]] is a theory which describes phenomena in [[solid-state physics]], notably the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconduction]], which treats vibrations of the solid-state lattice  as a "[[field (physics)|field]]" (i.e. without claiming that there is "[[reality|really]]" a field), with its own field quanta, called [[phonon]]s. Such "effective particles" derived from effective fields are also known as [[quasiparticle]]s.

In a certain sense, [[quantum field theory]], and any other currently known physical theory, could be described as "effective", as in being the "low energy limit" of an as-yet unknown "[[Theory of Everything]]".&lt;ref&gt;c.f. e.g. 	Ion-Olimpiu Stamatescu, Erhard Seiler, ''Approaches to fundamental physics: an assessment of current theoretical ideas'',  Lecture Notes in Physics, vol. 721,  Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-540-71115-5}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy and environmental engineering''' is a branch of [[engineering]] which seeks to efficiently use energy and to maintain the environment. Energy engineers require knowledge across many disciplines. Careers include work in the built environment, renewable and traditional energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htm |title=Energy and Environmental Engineering - BEng/BEng(Hons) at Edinburgh Napier University |publisher=Courses.napier.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090442/http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htm |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this area, solar radiation is important and must be understood. Solar radiation affects the Earth's weather and daylight available. This affects not only the Earth's environment but also the smaller internal environments which we create.&lt;ref&gt;Solar Radiation and Daylight Models, 2nd edition, T Muneer, Elsevier, Butterworth and Heinman, London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy engineering requires at least an understanding of [[mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[materials science|materials]], [[stoichiometry]], [[electrical machines]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturing processes]] and energy systems.

Environmental engineering can be branched into two main areas: internal environments and outdoor environments.

Internal environments may consist of housing or offices or other commercial properties. In this area, the environmental engineering sometimes stands for the designing of building services to condition the internal environment to a comfortable state or the removal of excess pollutants such as carbon dioxide or other harmful substances.&lt;ref&gt;Air Conditioning Engineering, Jones and Arnold, London 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

External environments may be water courses, [[air]], [[land]] or [[sea]]s, and may require new strategies for harnessing energy or the creation of treatment facilities for polluting technologies.

This broad degree area covers many areas but is mainly mechanically and electrically biased. It seeks to explore cleaner, more efficient ways of using [[fossil fuels]], while investigating and developing systems using renewable and sustainable resources, such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[wave power|wave]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U52151.htmvv ]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research funding''' is a term generally covering any funding for scientific [[research]], in the areas of both "hard" [[science]] and [[technology]] and [[social science]]. The term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds.

Most research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through [[research and development]] departments) and government (primarily carried out through universities and specialized government agencies; often known as ''research councils''). Some small amounts of scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations, especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as [[cancer]], [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to [[OECD]], more than 60% of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industries, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2015_sti_scoreboard-2015-en|title=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015: Innovation for growth and society |last= |first= |publisher=OECD |year=2015 |isbn=9789264239784 |location= |pages=156 |doi=10.1787/sti_scoreboard-2015-en |quote=|via=oecd-ilibrary.org|series=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively, in countries with less GDP, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly lower. The US government spends more than other countries on military R&amp;D, although the proportion has fallen from around 30% in the 1980s to under 20.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Government funding for medical research amounts to approximately 36%&lt;!-- OF WHAT?? --&gt; in the U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for ''basic'' scientific research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialization possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = R.A. | year = 2012 | title = Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735193312002199 | journal = International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer | volume = 39 | issue = 10| pages = 1467–1473 | doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of science policy}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the [[industrial revolution]], most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual [[inventor]]s using their own funds. A system of [[patent]]s was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. [[Charles Goodyear]]) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as [[corporation]]s developed, and discovered that continuous investment in [[research and development]] could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors - circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad - was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of [[Wilkinson Sword]] and [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] in the [[disposable razor]] market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==National funding by country==
{{Main|List of countries by research and development spending}}
Different countries spend vastly different amounts on research, in both absolute and relative terms. For instance, [[South Korea]] and [[Israel]] spend more than 4% of their GDP on research while many Arabic countries spend less than 1% (e.g. [[Saudi Arabia]] 0.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gross domestic spending on R&amp;D (indicator)|doi=10.1787/d8b068b4-en|url=https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
The US spent $456.1 billion for research and development (R&amp;D) in 2013, the most recent year for which such figures are available, according to the [[National Science Foundation]]. The private sector accounted for $322.5 billion, or 71%, of total national expenditures, with universities and colleges spending $64.7 billion, or 14%, in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|year=2016|title=Microbiology Policy Bulletin Board|url=http://www.asmscience.org/docserver/fulltext/microbe/11/4/microbe_11_4.pdf|journal=Microbe Magazine|volume=11|pages=145|via=ASM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] spent CHF 22 billion for R&amp;D in 2015 with an increase of 10.5% compared with 2012 when the last survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recherche et développement en Suisse 2015 (press release)|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/actualites/communiques-presse.assetdetail.2422944.html |accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relative terms, this represents 3.4% of the country's GDP. R&amp;D activities are carried out by nearly 125,000 individuals, mostly in the private sector (71%) and higher education institutions (27%).

==Process==
Often scientists apply for research funding which a granting agency may (or may not) approve to financially support.  These ''grants'' require a lengthy process as the granting agency can inquire about the researcher(s)'s background, the facilities used, the equipment needed, the time involved, and the overall potential of the scientific outcome.  The process of grant writing and grant proposing is a somewhat delicate process for both the grantor and the grantee:  the grantors want to choose the research that best fits their scientific principles, and the individual grantees want to apply for research in which they have the best chances but also in which they can build a body of work towards future scientific endeavors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] in the United Kingdom has devised an alternative method of fund-distribution: the sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] The wheels of such events are oiled with the promise of up to £1 million in funding, which is dished out at the end through a group peer-review process.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency.&lt;ref&gt;
Gonzales, Evelina Garza, "External Funding and Tenure at Texas State University-San Marcos" (2009). Texas State University. Applied Research Projects. Paper 315.  http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/315
&lt;/ref&gt;
"Research administration is all about service—service to our faculty, to our academic units, to the institution, and to our sponsors.  To be of service, we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations."&lt;ref&gt;
Robert A. Killoren, Jr., Associate Vice President for Research, Office of Sponsored Programs, Penn State U, Fall 2005.  From Lowry, Peggy (2006)  "Assessing the Sponsored Research Office". ''[http://www.aiseducation.com/RAG_product.html SPONSORED RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION: A Guide to Effective Strategies and Recommended Practices ]''
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, the [[National Council of University Research Administrators]] (NCURA) serves its members and advances the field of research administration through education and professional development programs, the sharing of knowledge and experience, and by fostering a professional, collegial, and respected community.

===Public funding===
{{Main article|Science policy}}
{{see also|Research council|United States national laboratories (disambiguation){{!}}United States national laboratories|Federally funded research and development centers|label 3 = List of federally-funded research and development centers (US)}}
Government-funded research can either be carried out by the government itself, or through [[Grant (money)|grants]] to researchers outside the government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The bodies providing public funding are often referred to as ''research councils''.

Critics{{Who|date=December 2014}} of [[basic research]] are concerned that research funding for the sake of knowledge itself does not contribute to a great return.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  However, scientific innovations often foreshadow or inspire further ideas unintentionally. For example, NASA's quest to put a man on the moon inspired them to develop better sound recording and reading technologies.  NASA's research was furthered by the music industry, who used it to develop audio cassettes.  Audio cassettes, being smaller and able to store more music, quickly dominated the music industry and increased the availability of music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

An additional distinction of government-sponsored research is that the government does not make a claim to the [[intellectual property]], whereas private research-funding bodies sometimes claim ownership of the intellectual property that they are paying to have developed. Consequently, government-sponsored research more often allows the individual discoverer to file intellectual property claims over their own work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====List of research councils====
Research councils are (usually public) bodies that provide research funding in the form of research grants or [[scholarship]]s.  These include [[arts council]]s and research councils for the funding of science.

Examples of companies that fund basic research include IBM (high temperature superconductivity was [[High-temperature superconductivity|discovered by IBM sponsored basic experimental research]] in 1986), L'Oreal (which created the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science|L'Oreal-Unesco prize for women scientists]] and finances internships), AXA (which launched a [http://www.axa-research.org/ Research Fund] in 2008 and finances Academic Institutions such as advanced fundamental mathematics French Foundation IHES).

A company may share resources with a [[materials science]] society to gain proprietary knowledge or trained workers.

===Hard money versus soft money===
In academic contexts, '''hard money''' may refer to funding received from a government or other entity at regular intervals, thus providing a steady inflow of financial resources to the beneficiary. The antonym, '''soft money''', refers to funding provided only through competitive [[research grant]]s and the writing of grant proposals.&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"&gt;[http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/30627 "What is a soft-money research position?"], Academia StackExchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard money is usually issued by the government for the advancement of certain projects or for the benefit of specific agencies. Community [[healthcare]], for instance, may be supported by the government by providing hard money. Since funds are disbursed regularly and continuously, the offices in charge of such projects are able to achieve their objectives more effectively than if they had been issued one-time grants.

Individual jobs at a research institute may be classified as "hard-money positions" or "soft-money positions";&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"/&gt; the former are expected to provide [[job security]] because their funding is secure in the long term, whereas individual "soft-money" positions may come and go with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded to the institution.

==Influence on research==
The source of funding may introduce conscious or unconscious biases into a researcher's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (COIs) is used by biomedical journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process. Conflict of interest disclosure, however, is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals which publish scientific research results.  When research is funded by the same agency that can be expected to gain from a favorable outcome there is a potential for biased results and research shows that results are indeed more favorable than would be expected from a more objective view of the evidence. A 2003 [[systematic review]] studied  the scope and impact of industry sponsorship in biomedical research.  The researchers found financial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions  widespread.  Results  showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions and concluded that "Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Relationship between Funding Source and Conclusion among Nutrition-Related Scientific Articles|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e5|work=[[PLOS Medicine]]|publisher=[[PLOS]]|author1=Lenard I Lesser |author2=Cara B Ebbeling |author3=Merrill Goozner |author4=David Wypij |author5=David S Ludwig |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040005|pmid=17214504|pmc=1764435|date=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British study found that a majority of the members on national and food policy committees receive funding from food companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food company sponsorship of nutrition research and professional activities: a conflict of interest?|volume=4|issue=5|pages=1015–1022|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=566532|work=[[Public Health Nutrition]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Marion Nestle|doi=10.1079/PHN2001253|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to cut costs, the pharmaceutical industry has turned to the use of private, nonacademic research groups (i.e., contract research organizations [CROs]) which can do the work for less money than academic investigators.  In 2001 CROs came under criticism when the editors of 12 major scientific journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication of any studies in which their product did poorly. They further criticized the trial methodology  stating that researchers are frequently restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 81460 | pmid=11584570 | volume=165 | issue=6 | title=Sponsorship, authorship and accountability |date=September 2001 | journal=CMAJ | pages=786–8| author1=Davidoff | first1=F | last2=Deangelis | first2=C.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], a worldwide group that aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions,  conducts [[systematic review]]s of [[randomized controlled trial]]s of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Eur J Clin Nutr|date=August 2005|volume=59|series=Suppl 1|issue=S1|pages=S147–S149|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602188|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n1s/full/1602188a.html|accessdate=31 January 2012|pmid=16052183|last1=Scholten|first1=R.

The systematic reviews are published in the [[Cochrane Library]]. A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests [COI] in underlying research studies used for medical [[meta-analyses]] reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that COIs in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.   The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author COI disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded "without acknowledgement of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies|work=The Cochrane Collaboration website|publisher=[[Cochrane Collaboration]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 researchers looked at the association between authors' published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of [[olestra]], a [[fat substitute]] manufactured by the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry.  They found that supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with P&amp;G and all authors disclosing an affiliation with P&amp;G were supportive.  The authors of the study concluded: "Because authors' published opinions were associated with their financial relationships, obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Authors' Financial Relationships With the Food and Beverage Industry and Their Published Positions on the Fat Substitute Olestra| pmc=1447808 | pmid=12660215|volume=93| issue=4 |year=2003|pages=664–9 | last1 = Levine | first1 = J | last2 = Gussow | first2 = JD | last3 = Hastings | first3 = D | last4 = Eccher | first4 = A | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.4.664 | journal=American Journal of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study in the journal Nature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15944677|year=2005|last1=Martinson|first1=BC|last2=Anderson|first2=MS|last3=De Vries|first3=R|title=Scientists behaving badly|volume=435|issue=7043|pages=737–8|doi=10.1038/435737a|journal=Nature|bibcode=2005Natur.435..737M}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 3247 US researchers who were all publicly funded (by the [[National Institutes of Health]]). Out of the scientists questioned, 15.5% admitted to altering design, methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source.

A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fang | first1 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Peer review and over-competitive research funding fostering mainstream opinion to monopoly | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 293–301 | doi=10.1007/s11192-010-0323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency of funding ==
Most funding agencies mandate efficient use of their funds, that is, they want to maximize outcome for their money spent. Outcome can be measured by [[Scientific literature|publication]] output, [[citation impact]], number of [[Patent|patents]], number of [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhDs]] awarded etc. Another question is how to allocate funds to different disciplines, institutions, or researchers. A recent study by Wayne Walsh found that “prestigious institutions had on average 65% higher grant application success rates and 50% larger award sizes, whereas less-prestigious institutions produced 65% more publications and had a 35% higher citation impact per dollar of funding.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/research-dollars-go-farther-at-less-prestigious-institutions--study-64529|title=Research Dollars Go Farther at Less-Prestigious Institutions: Study|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahls|first=Wayne P.|date=2018-07-13|title=High cost of bias: Diminishing marginal returns on NIH grant funding to institutions|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/367847|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=367847|doi=10.1101/367847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">'''Informal mathematics''', also called '''naïve mathematics''', has historically been the predominant form of [[mathematics]] at most times and in most cultures, and is the subject of modern [[ethnomathematics|ethno-cultural studies of mathematics]]. The philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] in his ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' aimed to sharpen the formulation of informal mathematics, by reconstructing its role in nineteenth century mathematical debates and concept formation, opposing the predominant assumptions of [[mathematical formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, ''Proofs and Refutations'' (1976), especially the Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informality may not discern between statements given by ''[[inductive reasoning]]'' (as in [[approximation]]s which are deemed "correct" merely because they are useful), and statements derived by ''[[deductive reasoning]]''.

==Terminology==

''Informal mathematics'' means any informal mathematical practices, as used in everyday life, or by aboriginal or ancient peoples, without historical or geographical limitation. Modern mathematics, exceptionally from that point of view, emphasizes formal and strict [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of all statements from given [[axiom]]s. This can usefully be called therefore ''formal mathematics''. Informal practices are usually understood intuitively and justified with examples—there are no axioms. This is of direct interest in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]: it casts light on the perceptions and agreements of other cultures.  It is also of interest in [[developmental psychology]] as it reflects a naïve understanding of the relationships between numbers and things. Another term used for informal mathematics is '''folk mathematics''', which is ambiguous; the [[mathematical folklore]] article is dedicated to the usage of that term among professional mathematicians.

The field of [[naïve physics]] is concerned with similar understandings of physics. People use mathematics and physics in everyday life, without really understanding (or caring) how mathematical and physical ideas were historically derived and justified.

==History==
There has long been a standard account of the development of [[geometry]] in [[ancient Egypt]], followed by [[Greek mathematics]] and the emergence of deductive logic. The modern sense of the term ''mathematics'', as meaning only those systems justified with reference to axioms, is however an [[anachronism]] if read back into history. Several ancient societies built impressive mathematical systems and carried out complex calculations based on proofless [[heuristic]]s and practical approaches. Mathematical facts were accepted on a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] basis. [[Empirical method]]s, as in science, provided the justification for a given technique. Commerce, [[engineering]], [[calendar]] creation and the prediction of [[eclipse]]s and [[stellar progression]] were practiced by ancient cultures on at least three continents. N.C. Ghosh included Informal Mathematics in the list of Folk Mathematics.

The '''Infrared Science Archive''' (IRSA) curates the science products of [[NASA]]'s infrared and submillimeter projects, such as the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE), the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] (IRAS), and the [[2MASS|Two Micron All-Sky Survey]] (2MASS). IRSA also serves data from infrared and submillimeter [[European Space Agency]] missions with [[NASA]] participation, including the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO), [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. {{As of|2014|06}}, IRSA provides access to more than 20 billion astronomical measurements, including all-sky coverage in 20 bands, spanning wavelengths from 1 micron to 10 millimeters. Approximately 10% of all refereed astronomical journal articles cite data sets curated by IRSA.&lt;ref&gt;http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

IRSA is part of the [[Infrared Processing and Analysis Center]] (IPAC) and is located on the campus of the [[California Institute of Technology]].

'''''Interrogating Ethnography''': Why Evidence Matters'' is a 2017 book by [[Steven Lubet]] of [[Northwestern University Law School]], critiquing methods used it the discipline of [[ethnography]].&lt;ref name="AliReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Syid|title=Interrogating Ethnography: Why Evidence Matters (book review)|journal=[[Contexts]]|date=Fall 2017|volume=16|issue=4|url=https://osf.io/wz6gy/|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Contexts]]'', Syid Ali of [[Long Island University]] called it "an essential critique of the most public-facing product sociology has to offer."&lt;ref name="AliReview"/&gt;

''Interrogating Ethnography'', which criticizes ethnographers for the practice of changing the name of the area they study, is part of the [[Replication crisis]].&lt;ref name="AliReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"/&gt;  But it is largely a critique of ethnography methodology when it relies on the narratives of interviewees with no attempt to verify assertions of fact.&lt;ref name="AliReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"/&gt;

Lubet began the project of writing this book after reading and publishing a notable critique of the use of evidence [[Alice Goffman]]'s controversial 2014 book ''On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City,"&lt;ref name="AliReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"/&gt;  That critique led him to read and attempt to verify "more than 50 ethnographic monographs and an equivalent number of articles. Focusing on sociologists’ studies of American cities... (and checking)  facts that could be documented — or not...  by consulting experts and pulling public records."&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"/&gt;

According to the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]], the book "has touched off a debate about what ethnographers might learn from legal scholars, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parry|first1=Marc|title=Law Professor’s New Book Puts Ethnography on Trial|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Law-Professor-s-New-Book/242068?cid=at&amp;elqTrackId=17f32405463e437ca96f686e0bc68fef&amp;elq=e37d7a9ac8f940c68e3fe554135ac513&amp;elqaid=17187&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=7456|accessdate=18 December 2017|publisher=chronicle of Higher Education|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The books reception by ethnographers has been mixed.&lt;ref name="ParryTrial"/&gt;

In the US {{as of|1998|lc=y}} the product was often sold on [[home shopping]] channels or by participants in [[multilevel marketing]],&lt;ref name="dope"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cecil |last= Adams |authorlink=Cecil Adams |title= Do laundry balls really work?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_007b.html |work= |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |location= |id= |page=1 |date=1997-07-25 |accessdate=2008-02-25 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic"&gt;{{citation |title= The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience |publisher= ABC-CLIO |editor= Michael Shermer, Pat Linse |chapter= Laundry Balls |author= Roahn H. Wynar |pages= 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not the case in all countries.

While many individuals report that these balls work, most test results show them to be similar to or less effective than washing in water without any detergent.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollings.mmu.ac.uk/~dtyler/ecochallenge/LAUNDRY_BALLS.htm |title=Laundry Balls |publisher=Faculty of Food, Clothing and Hospitality Management at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] |author=Dorothy Stein |date=1997-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=publico /&gt; Most of the effect can be attributed to the mechanical effect of the ball or to using hot water instead of cold water.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt;

The US  [[Federal Trade Commission]] has taken action against some of the manufacturers of these products because of their misleading claims.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1999/04/marketers-laundry-detergent-substitutes-charged-making-false-and Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitutes Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlements with FTC and Eleven States] and [http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1999/07/dallas-marketers-laundry-detergent-substitute-charged-making Dallas Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitute Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlement with FTC and Six States], [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer organizations from several countries have recommended against buying this type of product.&lt;!--there are several organizations listed in the body of the article, with sources--&gt;

==Types of laundry ball==
There are several shapes of laundry balls: laundry disks, globes, spheres or doughnuts.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Some of the balls carry components inside, like ceramic pieces, magnetic material or coloured liquid that is claimed to be "activated water".&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Manufacturers claim that these components have certain effects on washing efficacy, although studies don't show any difference between the different types of balls.&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Some balls can be refilled with pellets of special detergent, or other ingredients.&lt;ref name=pellets1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pellets2/&gt;

==Benefits claimed by manufacturers==
Laundry balls are marketed as cheaper, [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] friendly alternatives to ordinary washing powders or liquids. The manufacturers claim the following benefits, which are technically real:

* Lack of chemicals which may harm the environment&lt;ref name="skeptic" /&gt;
* Hypoallergenic and anti-irritation. 
* Reduced water usage (because less rinsing is required – this assumes the customer uses a different setting on their washing machine)
* Reduced use of energy by using cold water (see [[embodied energy]])&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;
* Can be re-used many times before refilling or replacing.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt; This can range from 60 to 2000 wash loads

But they also claim many benefits that laundry balls do not have, according to many studies:

* Removing stains as effectively as detergents&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;
* Removing germs and bacteria as effectively as detergents.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;
* Removing odors&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;	 
* Effective as bleacher&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;	 
* Effective as softener&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;
* Softening [[hard water]]&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt;
* Changing the [[pH]] of water&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt;
* Breaking molecule "clusters" in water, allowing easier penetration into the fabric&lt;ref name="miracle"/&gt;

However, the real effects are comparable to those of washing without any detergent&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu /&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson&gt;{{citation |title= Laundry: the home comforts book of caring for clothes and linens |author= Cheryl Mendelson |edition= illustrated |publisher= Simon and Schuster |year= 2005 |pages= 82, 83 |isbn= 9780743271455 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-gRK9HMQKoC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes worse.&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc daze"/&gt;

==Possible dangers==
The laundry ball could break open during washing, and the ceramic pieces inside it could damage the machinery of the washing machine.&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;

==Claimed mechanisms of action==
Manufacturers rarely agree on why their laundry balls work, hinting that these claims are just made up by each individual manufacturer.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Some claims are not backed by science, while others are an exaggeration of benefits.&lt;ref name="scientific american"/&gt; Balls that contain detergents may offer more cleaning power than water alone because their ingredients are comparable to normal washing powder, but in smaller quantities. It is claimed that conventional washing powder manufacturers recommend using more powder than is necessary, and that these powders contain unnecessary fillers or fragrances.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

The effect of the laundry balls may be explained by simple mechanical action and by the usage of hotter water. Some manufacturers claim that their products reduce energy consumption, but their pamphlets recommend using hot water.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; Hot water will clean some types of spots better than cold water,&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt; leading some people to conclude that the balls worked. The mechanical action of the laundry balls can help clean some types of spots,&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt; but a golf ball will achieve the same effect for much less money.&lt;ref name="scientific american"&gt;{{citation |title= Bunkum! Broad-mindedness is a virtue when investigating extraordinary claims, but often they turn out to be pure bunk (Skeptic column) |author= [[Michael Shermer]] |work= [[Scientific American]] |page= 36 |date= January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
Some manufacturers claim that the components inside their balls emit [[far infrared]] rays, which are claimed to reduce the surface tension of water and facilitate washing.&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; The claim of emitting infrared is not false, as almost all materials emit [[Thermal radiation|"far infrared waves"]] at [[room temperature]], in other words, [[heat]] radiation.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt; It is also true that [[Surface tension#Influence of temperature|heating reduces the surface tension of water]], but the effect of the radiation emitted by the balls is negligible compared to the radiation emitted by the internal walls of the washing machine or by the water, especially if the water is hot.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

===Magnetic properties===
{{Main|Magnetic water treatment}}
Magnetic water softeners claim that their magnetic fields can help remove [[limescale|scale]] from the washing machine and pipes, and prevent new limescale from adhering.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Some companies claim to remove hardness ions from hard water, or to precipitate the molecules in the water so they won't "stick" to the pipes, or to reduce the surface tension of water.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; The claims are dubious, the scientific basis is unclear, the working mechanism is vaguely defined and understudied, and high-quality studies report negative results.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; The reputation of these products is further damaged by the pseudoscientific explanations that promoters keep putting forward.&lt;ref name=magscams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/magscams.html |author=Stephen Lower |title=Magnetic water treatment pseudoscience |publisher=Chem1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to water structure===
Some magnetic products claim that they "change the molecular structure of water",&lt;ref name="ftc daze"&gt;{{citation |title= Wash Daze: Laundry Gadgets Won't Lighten the Load |author= FTC Consumer Alert |date= 1 April 1999 |url= http://www.bbb.org/us/article/ftc--wash-daze-laundry-gadgets-wont-lighten-the-load-4445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pseudoscientific claim with no real scientific basis.&lt;ref name="scientific american"/&gt; There is no such thing as "magnetized water".&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Water is not [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], so its water molecules do not align in the presence of a magnetic field.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Water is weakly [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] (so it is repelled by magnets), but only to an extent so small that it is undetectable to most instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Magnetized water: pseudoscientific snake oil |author=Stephen Lower |url= http://www.chem1.com/CQ/magwatscams.html |publisher=Chem1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special detergent===
Some balls are refillable with small pellets of detergent which are sold only by the manufacturer of the ball. Critics question whether the amount and type of detergent released by these balls is sufficient to generate significant cleaning effects.&lt;ref name=pellets1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/features/?id=1078&amp;PHPSESSID=2833b2dc91d17b76b4520775c06b78f0 |title=More on green washing... |publisher=grownupgreen |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2010-07-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623014122/http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/features/?id=1078&amp; |archivedate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pellets2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeremyjohnstone.com/blog/2008-05-11-ecoballs-are-they-for-real.html |title=EcoBalls&amp;nbsp;– Are they for real? &amp;#124; Ramblings of a Geek |publisher=Jeremy Johnstone |date=2008-05-11 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer protection==
In 1997, [[Amway]] offered a ceramic washing disk on its catalogue, but removed it after concluding that it had "no measurable impact on overall cleaning."&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;

In 1997 Trade-Net, sold a laundry ball product (the Blue Laundry Ball) in various US states. Trade-Net claimed that the blue liquid inside their balls was structured water "that emits a negative charge through the walls of the container into your laundry water." "This causes the water molecule cluster to disassociate, allowing much smaller individual water molecules to penetrate into the innermost part of the fabric." Dennis Barnum, a professor of inorganic chemistry at [[Portland State University]], said that the liquid was just water with a blue dye and couldn't possibly have the effect claimed by the manufacturer. Barnum also said that the claims were "gibberish" and used scientific terms in ways that sounded educated to the layman but didn't make any real sense. [[The Oregonian]] tested the balls, and found they washed marginally better than hot water with no detergent, and worse than using detergent.&lt;ref name="miracle"&gt;{{citation |title= 'Miracle' Clothes-Washing Device Investigated |journal= The Columbian |date= 1997-05-11 |author= AP | url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23377293.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After complaints, Trade-Net's claims were investigated by consumer protection departments in [[Utah]], Oregon and Florida, amongst others, and the company was prohibited from making certain claims, including that "such product cleans as well as conventional laundry detergent". Trade-Net offered a 'new' laundry ball product after this, but were forced to pay fines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/04/tradenet.shtm | title = Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitutes Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlements with FTC and Eleven States | date = April 22, 1999 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including $190,000 to Oregon's Department of Justice, $10,000 to Utah and then in April 1999, $155,000 to the states of New York, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma and the FTC. The company disappeared shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Sources:

The judge ruling against Trade-Net, issued in April 1999, said the manufacturers failed to substantiate their claims and hadn't informed consumers about reports showing that the claims were incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Laundry Balls Outlawed |journal= [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |author= [[Associated Press|AP]] |date= 1999-03-22 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56222067.html }} (require registration)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Government Says Laundry Ball Businesses Deceptive |journal= [[The Columbian]] |date= 1999-04-25 |author= AP |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23417426.html}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Consumers' Association]] published a report in the April 1998 issue of its magazine ''Choice''. It concluded that laundry balls were no better than cold water.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

The US [[Federal Trade Commission]] published in 1999 about laundry balls, rings and discs: "Tests show that these gadgets do little more than clean out your wallet. At best, they’re marginally better than washing clothes in hot water alone, and not as effective as washing them with laundry detergent. At worst, the products are completely useless."&lt;ref name="ftc daze"/&gt;

In 2000 the magazine ''Good Housekeeping'' tested several laundry balls sold in the US and concluded that "these gizmos do little more than clean out your wallet."&lt;ref name="housekeeping2000"/&gt;

In April 2009 the Italian consumer association [[Altroconsumo]] carried a small test and concluded that laundry balls didn't wash better than plain water.&lt;ref name=alco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altroconsumo.it/vita-privata-famiglia/nc/news/biowashball-senza-detersivo-e-si-vede |title=Biowashball: senza detersivo, e si vede - Altroconsumo |publisher=Altroconsumo.it |date= |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Spanish consumer organization OCU made a study of "ecobolas" (a type of laundry ball marketed in Spain). It compared the efficacy of the laundry ball, normal detergent, and no detergent at all. It concluded that laundry balls were no better than using just water, and it recommended that consumers simply use a minimum amount of detergent.&lt;ref name=ocu&gt;{{citation |journal= Compra Maestra |issue= 340 |publisher= OCU [[Organización de Consumidores y Usuarios]] |date=September 2009 |title= Ecobola: como lavar con agua |language= Spanish |url= http://www.ocu.org/equipamiento-del-hogar/ecobola-como-lavar-con-agua-s465574.htm |quote= [translation] In conclusion, the results of the Ecobola are far from those obtained with detergent. We can well attribute its "washing efficacy" to the mechanical action of the washing machine and to the temperature of the washing water... with which using this product is practically the same as washing only with water. (...) The advice of the OCU: if you want to spend less money and reduce residues, choose one of the detergents recommended in our last analysis and experiment until finding the minimal dosis that gives you good results. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Hong Kong Consumer Council published a report on the effect of using washing liquid, washing powder and washing balls. The former two were shown to be effective in removing stains, while the washing balls were not more effective than plain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.org.hk/website/ws_en/news/press_releases/p42104.html|title=Cleaning Power of Washing Balls No Better Than Plain Water&amp;nbsp;– Choice # 421 (November 15, 2011)|last=|first=|date=2011-11-15|publisher=Hong Kong Consumer Council|accessdate=2016-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128005202/http://www.consumer.org.hk/website/ws_en/news/press_releases/p42104.html|archivedate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations recommending against their use are [[Consumers Union]],&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; International Fabricare Institute (now called [[Drycleaning and Laundry Institute]]),&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; [[Maytag]],&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; [[Soap and Detergent Association]]&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; and Spanish [[Organización de Consumidores y Usuarios|OCU]].&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt;

In February 2011 the Spanish National Institute of Consume ([[Instituto Nacional del Consumo]] INC) ordered 14 manufacturers to cease their deceiving advertisement after testing the wash balls and concluding that they are as effective, or even ''less'' effective, than washing with water alone.&lt;ref name=publico&gt;[http://www.publico.es/359796/sanidad-frena-el-timo-de-la-ecobola Sanidad frena el timo de la 'ecobola'. El Instituto Nacional de Consumo requiere a 14 fabricantes que acaben con la publicidad engañosa de estos productos], [[Público (Spain)|''Público'']], Ainhoa Iriberri, 5 February 2011, Spanish. "The Instituto Nacional del Consumo (INC) has required the manufacturers of laundry balls (...) (also called ecoballs) to cease their deceiving publicity (...) The requirement has been issued after the making (...) of a study on 14 brands of ecoballs, made to find out the most obvious: if it's true that they are effective to wash clothes. The results of the work offer no doubts: the laundry balls do clean, yes, but the same or even less than water."&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 the Portuguese Consumer Rights Council requested a ban on the washing balls because none of the advantages advertised were proven in tests.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20120829184116/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/economia/interior.aspx?content_id%3D2741145 DECO exige retirada do mercado das "ecobolas"], [[Diário de Notícias (Portugal)|''Diário de Notícias'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian consumer advocacy group (Choice Australia) gave a 'Shonky Award' to Nanosmart Laundry Balls in October 2015, stating that they "don't work" and that they should be renamed "Nano-not-so-smart" after testing the balls against plain water and finding they had no effect and that their scientific claims were simply untrue. Choice Australia states that they will refer the product to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for investigation over Nanosmart's misleading claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2015/shonky-2015-nanosmart-laundry-balls.aspx|title=Shonkys 2015&amp;nbsp;– Nanosmart Cleaning Balls|date=2015-10-07|publisher=Choice Australia|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By making very vague claims, marketers can continue to sell laundry balls without running afoul of consumer protection laws that require veracity in advertisement.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

==Selling channels==
The product is often sold by participants in [[multilevel marketing]].&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt; They can also be found in ecological retail stores.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

During the initial marketing boom, balls were manufactured for other market niches, like washing cars.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

A '''mass formula''' is an [[equation]] or set of equations in [[physics]] which attempts to predict the [[mass]] or mass ratios of the [[subatomic particles]]. 
 
An important step in high energy physics was the discovery of the [[Gell-Mann–Okubo mass formula]] predicting relationships between masses of the members of [[Special_unitary_group#SU.283.29|SU(3)]] [[Quark model|multiplets]].

The development of an accurate mass formula is one of several fundamental aspects to developing a working [[theory of everything]], which is expected to overcome the incompatibilities between current [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics]] theories.

There are currently no universal mass formulae which are generally accepted as correct by the mainstream physics community, however several versions of potential mass formulae have been presented and are currently being explored by some (largely amateur) physics theorists.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26323">'''Mechanical explanations of gravitation''' (or '''kinetic theories of gravitation''') are attempts to explain the action of [[gravity]] by aid of basic [[classical mechanics|mechanical]] processes, such as [[pressure]] forces caused by [[Impulse (physics)|pushes]], without the use of any [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the [[aether theories|aether]]. However, such models are no longer regarded as viable theories within the mainstream scientific community and [[general relativity]] is now the standard model to describe gravitation without the use of actions at a distance. Modern "[[quantum gravity]]" hypotheses also attempt to describe gravity by more fundamental processes such as particle fields, but they are not based on classical mechanics.

== Screening ==
{{main|Le Sage's theory of gravitation}}

This theory is probably&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1876), Peck (1903), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known mechanical explanation, and was developed for the first time by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] in 1690, and re-invented, among others, by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (1748), [[Lord Kelvin]] (1872), and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), and criticized by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1875), and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908).

The theory posits that the [[force]] of gravity is the result of tiny [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s or [[wave]]s moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the [[universe]]. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed [[pressure]] but no net directional force. With a second object B present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, so-to-speak—that is, from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise, B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are "shadowing" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces.
[[Image:Pushing5.png|center|frame|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P5: Permeability, attenuation and mass proportionality&lt;/div&gt;]]

This shadow obeys the inverse square law, because the imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the "shadow" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter.

''Criticism'': This theory was declined primarily for [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons because a shadow only appears in this model if the particles or waves are at least partly absorbed, which should lead to an enormous heating of the bodies. Also drag, ''i.e.'' the resistance of the particle streams in the direction of motion, is a great problem too. This problem can be solved by assuming superluminal speeds, but this solution largely increases the thermal problems and contradicts [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré (1908), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1875, Atom), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vortex ==
[[Image:Descartes Aetherwirbel.jpg|thumb|250px|Aether vortices around celestial bodies]]
Because of his philosophical beliefs, [[René Descartes]] proposed in 1644 that no empty [[space]] can exist and that space must consequently be filled with [[matter]]. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with [[vortex|vortices]]. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to [[centrifugal force]], matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater [[inertia]]—so due to the pressure of the condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed into the center of the vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Descartes, R.  | author-link =René Descartes| date= 1824–1826 | title=Les principes de la philosophie (1644)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/document?O=N094260 | editor=Cousin, V. | journal= Oeuvres de Descartes | volume =3  | place = Paris | publisher=F.-G. Levrault}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, 1644; Zehe, 1980, pp. 65–70; Van Lunteren, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=zehe&gt;Zehe (1980), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the basic premises of Descartes, [[Christiaan Huygens]] between 1669 and 1690 designed a much more exact vortex model. This model was the first theory of gravitation which was worked out mathematically. He assumed that the aether particles are moving in every direction, but were thrown back at the outer borders of the vortex and this causes (as in the case of Descartes) a greater concentration of fine matter at the outer borders. So also in his model the fine matter presses the rough matter into the center of the vortex. Huygens also found out that the centrifugal force is equal to the force, which acts in the direction of the center of the vortex ([[centripetal force]]). He also posited that bodies must consist mostly of empty space so that the aether can penetrate the bodies easily, which is necessary for mass proportionality. He further concluded that the aether moves much faster than the falling bodies. At this time, Newton developed his theory of gravitation which is based on attraction, and although Huygens agreed with the mathematical formalism, he said the model was insufficient due to the lack of a mechanical explanation of the force law. Newton's discovery that gravity obeys the [[inverse square law]] surprised Huygens and he tried to take this into account by assuming that the speed of the aether is smaller in greater distance.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Huygens, C.  | author-link =Christiaan Huygens| date= 1944 | title=Discours de la Cause de la Pesanteur (1690)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77870g/f451.table |editors=Société Hollaise des Sciences | journal=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens | volume =21  | place = Den Haag | pages =443–488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lunteren&gt;Van Lunteren (2002), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Newton objected to the theory because [[drag (physics)|drag]] must lead to noticeable deviations of the orbits which were not observed.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{Citation  | author=Newton, I.  | author-link =Isaac Newton | date= 1846 | title=Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy (1687) | url=https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich | publisher=Daniel Adee| place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that [[moon]]s often move in different directions, against the direction of the vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is [[Begging the question|circular]], because this means that the aether obeys  [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]]. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref name=newton /&gt;

== Streams ==
In a 1675 letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], and later to [[Robert Boyle]], Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, letters quoted in detail in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science by Edwin Arthur Burtt, Double day Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as [[Bernoulli's principle]] published in Daniel Bernoulli's book ''Hydrodynamica'' in 1738.

However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton's comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00258 Newton, 1692, 4th letter to Bentley&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Newton is also well known for the phrase [[Hypotheses non fingo]], written in 1713:&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to the testimony of some of his friends, such as [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] or [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]], Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence.&lt;ref name=lunteren /&gt;

Similar to Newton, but mathematically in greater detail, [[Bernhard Riemann]] assumed in 1853 that the gravitational aether is an [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally to the masses within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into the direction of the central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Riemann, B. | author-link =Bernhard Riemann| date= 1876 | title=Neue mathematische Prinzipien der Naturphilosophie | editor=Dedekind, R. |editor2=Weber, W. | journal= Bernhard Riemanns Werke und gesammelter Nachlass | place = Leipzig | pages =528–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to solve the energy problem was made by [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky]] in 1888. Based on his aether stream model, which was similar to that of Riemann, he argued that the absorbed aether might be converted into new matter, leading to a mass increase of the celestial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Yarkovsky, I. O.| author-link =Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky  | title = Hypothese cinetique de la Gravitation universelle et connexion avec la formation des elements chimiques | place= Moscow | date =1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': As in the case of Le Sage's theory, the disappearance of energy without explanation violates the [[energy conservation law]]. Also some drag must arise, and no process which leads to a creation of matter is known.

== Static pressure ==

Newton updated the second edition of ''Optics'' (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first explanation (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the [[lift (force)|lift]], a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether.

Like Newton, [[Leonhard Euler]] presupposed in 1760 that the gravitational aether loses density in accordance with the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass proportionality, matter consists mostly of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Euler, L.  | author-link =Leonhard Euler| date= 1776 | title=Briefe an eine deutsche Prinzessin, Nr. 50, 30. August 1760  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaMAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA173,M1 | pages=173–176 | place=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Both Newton and Euler gave no reason why the density of that static aether should change. Furthermore, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] pointed out that in this "hydrostatic" model "''the state of stress... which we must suppose to exist in the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel could support''".&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;Maxwell (1875, Attraction), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves ==

[[Robert Hooke]] speculated in 1671 that gravitation is the result of all bodies emitting waves in all directions through the aether. Other bodies, which interact with these waves, move in the direction of the source of the waves. Hooke saw an analogy to the fact that small objects on a disturbed surface of water move to the center of the disturbance.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;Taylor (1876), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory was worked out mathematically by [[James Challis]] from 1859 to 1876. He calculated that the case of attraction occurs if the wavelength is large in comparison with the distance between the gravitating bodies. If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Challis, J. | author-link =James Challis| date= 1869 | title=Notes of the Principles of Pure and Applied Calculation  | url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprinciple00chalrich | place = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Maxwell objected that this theory requires a steady production of waves, which must be accompanied by an infinite consumption of energy.&lt;ref name="maxwell 2"&gt;Maxwell (1875), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;
Challis himself admitted, that he hadn't reached a definite result due to the complexity of the processes.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

== Pulsation ==

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1871) and [[Carl Anton Bjerknes]] (1871) assumed that all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy to the fact that, if the pulsation of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they will attract each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is ''not'' in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of [[electric charge]]s. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[Woldemar Voigt]].&lt;ref name=zenneck&gt;Zenneck (1903), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'' : To explain universal gravitation, one is forced to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances.&lt;ref name=zenneck /&gt; And Maxwell argued that this process must be accompanied by a permanent new production and destruction of aether.&lt;ref name=maxwell /&gt;

== Other historical speculations ==

In 1690, [[Pierre Varignon]] assumed that all bodies are exposed to pushes by aether particles from all directions, and that there is some sort of limitation at a certain distance from the Earth's surface which cannot be passed by the particles. He assumed that if a body is closer to the Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Varignon, P. | author-link =Pierre Varignon| date= 1690 | title=Nouvelles conjectures sur la Pesanteur  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74179x | place = Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] assumed that the effect of the aether is proportional to the complete surface of the elementary components of which matter consists (similar to Huygens and Fatio before him). He also assumed an enormous penetrability of the bodies. However, no clear description was given by him as to how exactly the aether interacts with matter so that the law of gravitation arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Lomonosow, M. | author-link =Mikhail Lomonosov| date= 1970 | title=On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight (1758)  | url=https://archive.org/details/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp | editor= Henry M. Leicester | journal= Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | place = Cambridge | publisher=Harvard University Press | pages =224–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, [[John Herapath]] tried to apply his co-developed model of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases on gravitation. He assumed that the aether is heated by the bodies and loses density so that other bodies are pushed to these regions of lower density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Herapath, J. | author-link =John Herapath| date= 1821 | title=On the Causes, Laws and Phenomena of Heat, Gases, Gravitation  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCsAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA273 | journal= [[Annals of Philosophy]]  | volume =9  | place = Paris | pages =273–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown by Taylor that the decreased density due to [[thermal expansion]] is compensated for by the increased speed of the heated particles; therefore, no attraction arises.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

==Recent theorizing==
These mechanical explanations for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although such ideas continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the twentieth century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited. However, some researchers outside the scientific mainstream still try to work out some consequences of those theories.

== Productions ==

=== Pilot Show ===

In 2002, Dr. Schadler and Dr. Garde  produced a seven-minute pilot show for the local [[planetarium]] called “Molecularium” for the [[Digistar II]] Planetarium system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=217 |title=RPI: News &amp; Events - What Really Matters: Rensselaer, Junior Museum, and NSF Open the "Molecularium" |publisher=News.rpi.edu |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It introduces children to the concepts of atoms and molecules from small molecules like [[H2O]] to larger molecules like [[polymers]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Molecularium1.jpg|thumb|right]] --&gt;

In early 2004, Schadler, Garde, and Siegel were awarded a U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] grant to make a new Molecularium show exclusively for the [[fulldome]] medum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=101824 |title=National Science Foundation (NSF) News - Presenting the Molecularium - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recruited the filmmaker and experience designer [[V. Owen Bush]] to bring the idea to life. Bush founded the production company Nanotoon Entertainment with writer/producer Kurt Przybilla to realize the new project. Bush and Przybilla proposed an adventure story of personified atoms flying a ship called the Molecularium through nanoscale materials including a snowflake, a penny, a stick of gum and the human body.

In February 2005, the team debuted "Molecularium - Riding Snowflakes" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/education/84/8417kids.html |title=Chemical &amp; Engineering News: Education - Kids And Cartoons |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/515452/ |title=ACS President Views Molecularium(tm) as Part of National Chemistry Week |publisher=Newswise.com |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 23-minute digital planetarium show at the [[Children's Museum of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/139164/molecule_movie_offers_new_twist_for_kids/ |title=Molecule Movie Offers New Twist for Kids - Science News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=925&amp;skinNameSticky=default |title=RPI: News &amp; Events - Rensselaer’s Molecularium  Show Premieres |publisher=News.rpi.edu |date=2005-02-04 |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527214643/http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=925&amp;skinNameSticky=default |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, "Molecularium - Riding Snowflakes" won the Domie at Domefest in Albuquerque New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domefest.org/domie-award-winners/ |title=Past Domie Winners |publisher=Domefest.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=scarr at April 7, 2006 11:03 AM |url=http://www.unm.edu/~market/cgi-bin/archives/001167.html |title=UNM Today: LodeStar turns inward to become 'Molecularium' |publisher=Unm.edu |date=2006-04-07 |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704011000/http://www.unm.edu/~market/cgi-bin/archives/001167.html |archive-date=2012-07-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Molecularium - Riding Snowflakes" has shown at [[Chabot Space and Science Center]] in Oakland Ca., the [[Newark Museum]] Planetarium in Newark, NJ, Dubai Children’s City, UAE, and [[Thinktank, Birmingham]], UK, among many other digital planetariums.

'''Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies named after M.V. Lomonosov''' (traditional abbreviation "MITHT") is one of the oldest universities in the country that offer training in a wide range of specialties in the field of [[chemical technology]].

Currently, there are more than 4,500 students in nine areas of undergraduate, 28 master's programs and 23 scientific specialties for training of candidates and doctors of science. In MITHT there are 8 dissertation councils for doctoral and PhD theses.

Research and teaching activities are performed by more than 400 professors and 158 scientists, including more than 120 doctors of science and professors. Located in Moscow at Vernadsky Avenue, Building 86 (new building complex) and Malaya Pirogovskaya, Building 1 (historic building).

== History ==

History of the University and its continuing operations as a higher education institution begins 1 July 1900 and covers several stages.

=== Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow Higher Women Courses (1900–1918) ===
1 July (14 July, [[New Style]]) 1900 was organized the [[Moscow Higher Women Courses]] (MHWC). Their structure originally consisted of two departments: History and Philosophy and [[Physics]] and Mathematics. On the last one were soon opened two offices: mathematical and natural, and after a few years two more – medical and chemical-pharmaceutical. The initiators and the first lecturers were outstanding scientists, academics subsequently [[Sergey Chaplygin|S. A. Chaplygin]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky|V. I. Vernadsky]], [[Nikolay Zelinsky|N. D. Zelinsky]] (the inventor of the [[gas mask]] (1916)), Professors V. F. Davidov, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, A. N. Reformatsky, A. A. Eichenwald, S. G. Krapivin. The first director of MHWC was Professor [[Vladimir Guerrier|V. I. Guerrier]].

In 1905 as a director was elected S. A. Chaplygin, the leading scientist in the field of [[Hydrodynamics|hydro]]- and [[aerodynamics]], the organizer of the construction of school buildings on the Malaya Pirogovskaya street (formerly Devichie Pole). He remained in that post until 1918.

By the beginning of [[World War I]] MHWC turned into the one of the largest higher education institutions in the country. The number of trainees reached 710, and during the existence of courses released 5760 professionals. In turning into a first-class university MHWC paramount importance had an exceptional organizational skill of S. A. Chaplygin, later shown to them with equal brilliance in creating [[TsAGI]].

=== Department of Chemistry of the 2nd Moscow State University (1918–30) ===
16 October 1918 MHWC were converted into second Moscow State University. The first rector of the 2nd Moscow State University was appointed [[academician]] [[Sergey Namyotkin|S. S. Nametkin]] who worked since 1913 as a head of the Department of [[Organic Chemistry]] of MHWC. As rector, he remained until 1924. As part of the 2nd Moscow State University became the chemical-pharmaceutical department, which in 1919 was transformed into the chemical and pharmaceutical department.  At this time, on the faculty worked well-known Professors A. M. Berkengeim, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, S. S. Nametkin, M. I. Prozin, A. N. Reformatsky, [[O. N. Tsuberbiller]]. In 1929, the faculty became a chemical faculty of the university type with specialties such as:
* Chemical – pharmaceutical chemistry;
* Basic chemistry;
* [[Aniline]] chemistry;
* Chemistry of [[Rare-earth element|rare elements]];
* Coke-benzene chemistry;
* Organic Synthesis.

Faculty graduates go to work in the factories, involve in the implementation of research projects that receive a wide scope. During 1922 – 1928 years it has been published about 300 papers and 11 monographs. The greatest successes are achieved in the fields of organic and [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] under the direction of heads of departments, academics S. S. Nametkin, B. M. Rodionov, Professor A. M. Berkengeim. Production of new drugs being introduced in the pharmaceutical factory belonging to faculty.

=== Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (1930–92) ===
18 April 1930 by order of the [[People's Commissariat]] second MSU was reorganized into three independent institutions: Medical (now [[Russian National Research Medical University|RSMU them. Pirogov]]) Pedagogical (now [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|MPSU]]), and Chemical Technology (now MITHT). Last transferred to the jurisdiction of the Vsehimprom [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy|VSNKh]] [[USSR]]. In addressing this issue directly involved [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].

10 May 1931 Chemical and Pharmaceutical Faculty became an independent and received a new name – the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (MITHT). Historically, the name of the Institute is due to the nature of objects that are studied by students: they were small capacity chemical and pharmaceutical technology, technology of [[platinum group]] metals and [[rare-earth elements]]. From this moment begins a new stage of development of the institution, which is quickly becoming one of the leading universities in the [[chemical industry]]. Front of it set the goal of training for high-tech industries of chemical technology. In MITHT the first time in the country began to train engineers on the technology of thin inorganic products, synthetic rubber, thin organic produce synthetic [[liquid fuel]]s, [[organometallic compounds]] and a number of other specialties.

In the process of restructuring of education at the institute have been preserved and developed the best traditions of MHWC and 2nd Moscow State University: a high level of theoretical training and a combination of academic and scientific work, helped by the fact that the teaching work at the institute and chairing of departments were performed by outstanding scientists and educators which created a school and research areas.

Special departments were prepared engineers for industries which were still being created in the first five years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as [[atophan]], [[benzocaine]], [[procaine]], [[bromural]], [[thiokol]], [[ichtyol]], [[validol]], [[antipyrine]], [[caffeine]], [[alkaloid]]s and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic [[Alexander Nesmeyanov|A. N. Nesmeyanov]] (later President of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]]) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as [[tungsten]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]], and [[rare-earth elements]]. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of [[uranium]] and [[radium]]. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting [[Superhard material|super-hard alloys]].

7 May 1940 for academic achievement and great progress in the preparation of chemists institute is named after the outstanding Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov]].

During the war, groups of departments in collaboration with industry and research institutes conduct intensive research on defense-related development and implementation of the executed work. Thus, under the supervision of Professor N. I. Gelperin was created the most powerful bomb in [[World War II]] – FAB-5000NG that terrified [[Hitlerites]]. Efforts of the Institute as a whole and individual professors and teachers were appreciated by the country. Professors B. A. Dogadkin, N. I. Krasnopevtsev, V. V. Lebedinskij, S. S. Medvedev, S. I. Sklyarenko and Ya. K. Sirkin were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] laureates, and associate professor K. A. Bolshakov won that title twice.

The post-war period was characterized by intensive work of the Institute staff in the aftermath of the war, the creation of the necessary conditions for teaching and research. Among the most important achievements of the postwar period MITHT need to include: 
* The total synthesis of a number of natural alkaloids – [[pilocarpine]], pilozinin, alkaloids of [[propane]] series ([[tropine]], [[cocaine]]), [[arecoline]], [[eserine]], [[emetine]], [[psyhotrine]], [[emataliine]], [[cinchonamine]], [[tubocurarine]] and other alkaloids of [[curare]] ([[magnolin]], [[magnolamine]], [[dauricine]]). For this work, Professor N. A. Preobragensky in 1952 was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of the first degree;
* The synthesis of physiologically active derivatives of [[piperidine]] ([[anesthetics]], [[analgesics]], and other drugs), technology development and industrial development of high-output [[painkiller]] "[[promedol]]";
* Academician A. N. Bashkirov for the first time in the world and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1959 has been implemented industrial technology for production of higher [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohols]] on the basis of a synthesis of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] (the so-called "oxosynthesis technology");
* Development of technology for the production of vitamins [[Retinol|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Ascorbic acid|C]] and [[Vitamin K|K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]];
* Create rubbers based on new types of caoutchouc, operating at high and low temperatures in harsh operating conditions.

The high scientific – technical research conducted at the institute, evidenced by the fact that MITHT became one of the first places among the universities and research institutes on the number of implemented inventions. Employees of the institute published 450–500 scientific papers and received 50–60 [[Patent|invention certificates]] a year. The Institute conducts research on economic agreements and contracts on cooperation with industry and research institutes, whose number exceeded 150.

MITHT, in fact, has turned into a complex of the university and research institutes. On 2500–3000 students, in addition to 400 professors and lecturers, employed more than 900 scientists. Two to one – that is the ratio of students, academic and teaching staff, which was reached in MITHT. Good specialist, engineer cannot be prepared without bringing him to participate in real, serious scientific research in the learning process.

11 February 1971 for his services to the training of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Education in MITHT always featured a deep fundamental training, which included, along with a full range of natural sciences study the big cycle engineering and technological disciplines. Special training was carried out by the so-called "thin" chemical technologies that are, as a rule, small capacity technology, implemented on the basis of the latest achievements of chemical science and technology. That is, in fact, the students received a university degree in combination with engineering training.

=== Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov (1992–2011) ===
In 1992, the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov has received a new, higher educational status – status of the Academy. With the name change has changed the status and range of activities of the institute along with old technology, new specialty Humanitarian – Management Profile: "Economics and Management (chemical industry)", "[[Environmental Protection]]", "[[Standardization]] and [[Certification]]". These specialties are subject to major technologies and solve their narrow-profile tasks.

Before the transition to a tiered structure the education of students was carried out in one direction, "Chemical Technology and [[Biotechnology]]", which consists of seven specialties. After the transition academy led training in seven areas of undergraduate, graduate five areas (including 26 master's programs) and 13 majors (including 25 majors) in full-time and part-correspondence courses, and conducted post-graduate education in 24 specialties and additional education in primary educational programs MITHT.

To implement in MITHT a tiered system of higher education were opened new training units. Along with main faculties teaching of students was performed at the Faculty of [[Natural Science]], Faculty of [[Humanities]], Faculty of Management, Economics and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of further education at the Institute of [[Distance Education]].

According to the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Federal Agency for Supervision in Education and Science]] in 2008 in MITHT worked one of the most highly qualified scientific and technical teaching staff of universities and academies of Russia: doctors and candidates of sciences accounted for about 80% of the teachers. At the academy a total enrollment of 4,500 undergraduate and graduate students, taught 119 professors, doctors, and 218 associate professors, candidates of sciences.

=== Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies (2011–present) ===
[[File:Panorama of MITHT.jpg|center|1200px|thumb|Panorama of MITHT main building on Vernadsky prospect in Moscow, Russia]]
In 2011, the Academy received a University status.

The successes of the University in education, research and [[innovation]], the recognition of the scientific and pedagogical schools, its international status and worldwide fame are undoubtedly merit in the first professors, assistant professors, lecturers, and they have created in the walls of the university unique creative scientific and educational environment. Friendly and supportive atmosphere of the business and human interaction with the students and teachers together form the necessary conditions for the development of the individual, focused, motivated professional growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11876">'''Nature writing''' is [[nonfiction]] or [[fiction]] [[prose]] or [[poetry]] about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes [[natural history]] essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lyon|first=Thomas Jefferson|publisher=Milkweed Editions|date=2001|title=This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing|ISBN=978-1571312563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.

Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of [[natural history]] that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the "[[parson-naturalist]]" [[Gilbert White]] (1720 – 1793),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1903|title=English Literature: From Milton to Johnson|chapter="Gilbert White"|location=London|publisher=William Heinemann|pages=375–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA375}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789).

[[William Bartram]] (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.

==Pioneers==
Gilbert White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. pp. 97-112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]: "Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt; White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'', as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]].

The tradition of [[Parson-naturalist|clerical naturalists]] predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).

William Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'', published in 1791. [[Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] (1785 – 1851), [[Charles Darwin]]( (1809 – 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1906|title=English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson|chapter=CHARLES DARWIN|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co|pages=298–302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Jefferies]] (1848 – 1887), [[Susan Fenimore Cooper]] (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803 – 1882) [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[M. Krishnan]], and [[Edward Abbey]] (although he rejected the term for himself).

Another important early work is ''[[A History of British Birds]]''  by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804.  The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield/|title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield - British Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Europe==
Some important contemporary figures in Britain include [[Richard Mabey]], [[Roger Deakin]], [[Mark Cocker]], and [[Oliver Rackham]]. Rackham's books included ''Ancient Woodland'' (1980) and ''The History of the Countryside'' (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include [[Birds Britannica]] (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and ''Crow Country'' (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book ''Waterlog'' was published.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/08/archive-environmentalist-roger-deakin-university?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Archives of environmentalist Roger Deakin given to university|date= 8 May 2010|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the short story ''[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]'' by [[John Cheever]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently made into [[The Swimmer (1968 film)|a film]] starring [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;/ref&gt; it describes his experiences of '[[Open water swimming|wild swimming]]' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates [[Freedom to roam|open access]] to the countryside and waterways.  Deakin's book ''Wildwood'' appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.

In 2017 the German book publishing company [[Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin]] started to grant the [[Deutscher Preis für Nature Writing|German Award for Nature Writing]], an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an [[artist in residency]] grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island [[Vilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-preis_fuer_nature_writing_2018.1492164.html |title= Preis für Nature Writing 2018: Sabine Scho und Christian Lehnert ausgezeichnet |date=2018-07-13 |website=boersenblatt.net |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Council]] in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishcouncil.de/uk-germany-2018/writers-nature-stipendium |title=Writers by Nature: Stipendium |date=2018 |website=britishcouncil.de |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Neutron embrittlement''', sometimes more broadly '''radiation embrittlement''', is the [[embrittlement]] of various materials due to the action of [[neutron]]s. This is primarily seen in [[nuclear reactor]]s, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of [[atoms]] that are hit by the neutrons, this same action also gives rise to [[neutron-induced swelling]] causes materials to grow in size, and the [[Wigner effect]] causes energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of [[energy]].

Neutron embrittlement mechanisms include:
* [[Hardening (metallurgy)|Hardening]] and [[Pinning points|dislocation pinning]] due to nanometer features created by irradiation
* Generation of lattice defects in [[Collision cascade|collision cascades]] via the high-energy recoil atoms produced in the process of [[neutron scattering]].
* Diffusion of major defects, which leads to higher amounts of solute diffusion, as well as formation of nanoscale defect-solute cluster complexes, solute clusters, and distinct phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0107/odette-0107.html|title=Embrittlement of Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessels|website=www.tms.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embrittlement in Nuclear Reactors ==
Neutron irradiation embrittlement limits the service life of [[Reactor pressure vessel|reactor-pressure vessels]] (RPV) in nuclear power plants due to the degradation of reactor materials. In order to perform at high efficiency and safely contain coolant water at temperatures around 290ºC and pressures of ~7 MPa (for [[Boiling water reactor|boiling water reactors]]) to 14 MPa (for [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water reactors]]), the RPV must be heavy-section steel. Due to regulations, RPV failure probabilities must be very low. To achieve sufficient safety, the design of the reactor assumes large cracks and extreme loading conditions. Under such conditions, a probable [[Failure cause|failure mode]] is rapid, catastrophic [[Fracture mechanics|fracture]] if the vessel steel is brittle. Tough RPV base metals that are typically used are A302B, A533B plates, or A508 forgings; these are quenched and tempered, low-alloy steels with primarily tempered bainitic microstructures. Over the past few decades, RPV embrittlement has been addressed by the use of tougher steels with lower trace impurity contents, the decrease of neutron flux that the vessel is subject to, and the elimination of beltline welds. However, embrittlement remains an issue for older reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Odette|first=G. R.|last2=Lucas|first2=G. E.|date=2001-07-01|title=Embrittlement of nuclear reactor pressure vessels|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|journal=JOM|language=en|volume=53|issue=7|pages=18–22|doi=10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|issn=1047-4838|bibcode=2001JOM....53g..18O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to embrittlement than boiling water reactors. This is due to PWRs sustaining more neutron impacts. To counteract this, many PWRs have a specific [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] design that reduces the number of neutrons hitting the vessel wall. Moreover, PWR designs must be especially mindful of embrittlement because of pressurized thermal shock, an accident scenario that occurs when cold water enters a pressurized reactor vessel, introducing large [[thermal stress]]. This thermal stress may cause fracture if the reactor vessel is sufficiently brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/prv.html|title=Backgrounder on Reactor Pressure Vessel Issues|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2016|website=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''''' is a 1977 book on evolution by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], in which the author explores the relationship between embryonic development ([[ontogeny]]) and [[Evolution|biological evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]). Unlike his many popular books of essays, it was a technical book, and over the following decades it was influential in stimulating research into [[heterochrony]], changes in the timing of embryonic development, which had been neglected since [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that [[Recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]] had been largely discredited.

==Context==

''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' is [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s first technical book. He wrote that [[Ernst Mayr]] had suggested in passing that he write a book on development. Gould stated he "only began it as a practice run to learn the style of lengthy exposition before embarking on my magnum opus about macroevolution."&lt;ref name="Gould1977"&gt;{{cite book | title= Ontogeny and Phylogeny | author= Gould, S.J.| year=1977 | publisher=Belknap Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-63940-9| pages=vii–viii}} Also {{ISBN|0-674-63941-3}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;  This later work was published in 2002 as ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.

==Contents==

The first half of the book explores [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[Recapitulation theory|biogenetic law]] (recapitulation)—the largely discredited idea that embryonic developmental stages replay the evolutionary transitions of adult forms of an organism's past descendants—and how this idea influenced thinking in [[biology]], [[theology]], and [[psychology]].

The second half of the book details how modern concepts such as [[heterochrony]] (changes in developmental timing) and [[neoteny]] (the retardation of developmental expression or growth rates) influence [[macroevolution]] (major evolutionary transitions).

==Reception==

===Contemporary===
[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|[[Ernst Haeckel]] supposed that embryonic development [[recapitulation theory|recapitulated]] an animal's phylogeny, and introduced heterochrony as an exception for individual organs. Modern biology agrees instead with [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s view that development itself varies, such as by changing the timing of different processes, to cause a branching phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The herpetologist [[David B. Wake]], in ''[[Paleobiology]]'', wrote that the topic was "at once so obviously important and so intrinsically difficult" that few people would tackle it. The parallelism that Haeckel noted between ontogeny and phylogeny was, Wake observed, a strong argument for evolution, but hardly anyone dared to discuss it. He called the book very good, and &lt;!--correctly--&gt;predicted that it would set the stage for "endless research", but found it also in a way unsatisfying, using "undigested theory from ecology to ''explain'' what is, as yet, unexplainable. Summing up, Wake calls the book "erudite, important, provocative, and controversial", but noted that it could have been much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/wake/1978_Paleobiology_ontphyl.pdf Shape, form, development, ecology, genetics, and evolution] – by [[David B. Wake]], ''[[Paleobiology]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The embryologist [[Søren Løvtrup]], in ''Systematic Zoology'', noted that the book had two objectives, unexceptionably to gain practice, and "more dubious[ly]", to show that "in spite of the collapse of Haeckel's biogenetic law, the subject of parallels between ontogenesis and phylogenesis is still of importance to biology".&lt;ref name=Løvtrup1978&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2412825.pdf Book review] – by [[Søren Løvtrup]], ''Systematic Zoology'', 1978, vol 27, issue 1, pp. 125–130&lt;/ref&gt; In Løvtrup's view, this was because Haeckel's law had been refuted except where evolution had by chance happened to add to the end of development. Gould had little new to report, as people knew half a century earlier that development could be modified at other stages; the book was "a great disappointment." Haeckel could "of course be of historical interest" but Gould had chosen not to research Haeckel's influence. Work on "wrong theories" represented, Løvtrup wrote, "a terrible waste of effort and time, and block[ed] further progress."&lt;ref name=Løvtrup1978/&gt;

[[File:Human development neoteny body and head proportions pedomorphy maturation aging growth.png|thumb|Gould's suggestion of [[neoteny]] in human development provoked a hostile response from some anthropologists.&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt;]]

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]], in ''American Anthropologist'', noted that 2 years earlier, [[E. O. Wilson]]'s ''[[Sociobiology (book)|Sociobiology]]'' had with "woeful ignorance" strayed into anthropology, and Wilson's "bright young colleague" Gould had now done the same thing, possibly making trouble for years to come. Gould was "a wonderful writer, literate, erudite, gracefully witty, and gifted with the ability to present difficult material in a straightforward and easily readable fashion."&lt;ref name=Brace1978&gt;[https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/aa.1978.80.4.02a00510 Book review] – by [[C. Loring Brace]], ''American Anthropologist'', December 1978. DOI 10.1525/aa.1978.80.4.02a00510&lt;/ref&gt; 
The bulk of the book was fine, though of no interest to anthropologists. But the tenth chapter, "Retardation and Neoteny in Human Evolution", would "mislead a great many people" who would be unable to make an informed judgement about its conclusions. Gould " tums out to be just as much of a teleologist and progressivist as the scholars of previous generations whom he appraises so effectively. He notes that we associate “cute” features with mammals of higher intelligence, features that show 'the common traits of babyhood: relatively large eyes, short face, smooth features, bulbous cranium. The presence of this complex in ad- vanced adult mammals argues for neoteny' (Gould p.&amp;nbsp;350)."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt; In Brace's view, "Gould's main thesis founders between the [[Scylla]] of mosaic evolution and the [[Charybdis]] of Darwinian theory."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt; Brace concluded that Gould had provided "nothing more useful than the vision that human form can be understood by regarding 'man' as an overgrown retarded child."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt;

&lt;!--1977--&gt;James Gorman, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the book was rich but not easy to read; it was primarily for biologists, with long and precise arguments in technical language; a simpler account of the same topic was to be found in Gould's essay "Ever Since Darwin". Gorman called the book scholarly, entertaining and informative, expressed "with clarity and wit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/home/gould-darwin.html The History of a Theory] – by James Gorman, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 November 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The zoologist [[A. J. Cain]], in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', called it "a superb analysis of the use of ontogenetic analogy, the controversies over ontogeny and phylogeny, and the classification of the different processes observable in comparing different ontogenies."&lt;ref name="Cain1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cain |first1=A. J. |title=Ontogenetic analogy |journal=Nature |date=27 April 1978 |volume=272 |issue=5656 |pages=758–759 | doi = 10.1038/272758a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a "massive book", excellently illustrated with often surprising examples, covering both the history and a functional interpretation of heterochrony. Cain found it refreshing to find someone who had a good word for Ernst Haeckel, and who did not "treat [[Charles Bonnet]] as a stupid monomaniac" but who brought out the relationship "between acquired characters and recapitulation in the work of the American neo-Lamarckians".&lt;ref name="Cain1978"/&gt;

===Retrospective===
[[File:Heterochrony.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|The book stimulated research into [[heterochrony]], a change in the timing or rate of any process in embryonic development.&lt;ref name=Barnes2014/&gt;]]

The evolutionary biologists Kenneth McNamara and Michael McKinney stated in 2005 that of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, "the one with the most impact is probably ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory would be an understatement. It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premise—that variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate."&lt;ref name="McNamara&amp;McKinney"&gt;{{cite book | title=Macroevolution: Diversity, Disparity, Contingency. Essays in Honor of Stephen Jay Gould | journal=Paleobiology | volume=31 | issue=2 | author=McNamara, K. J., &amp; McKinney, M.

M. Elizabeth Barnes, in ''The Embryo Project Encyclopedia'', looking back at the book in 2014, writes that it became widely cited in evolutionary and developmental biology, encouraging research on acceleration and retardation of development (forms of [[heterochrony]]), and investigation of paedomorphosis in human evolution. Barnes notes that "along with other work by Gould, such as '[[The Spandrels of San Marco|The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm]]' [the book] is often credited for influencing the rise of a biological approach called evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo, which worked to integrate evolutionary and developmental biology."&lt;ref name=Barnes2014&gt;[https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/ontogeny-and-phylogeny-1977-stephen-jay-gould Ontogeny and Phylogeny] – by M.

The ''Principia'' is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;J M Steele, University of Toronto, [http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html (review online from [[Canadian Association of Physicists]])] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401071521/http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html |date=1 April 2010 }} of N Guicciardini's "Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton’s Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736" (Cambridge UP, 1999), a book which also states (summary before title page) that the "Principia" "is considered one of the masterpieces in the history of science".&lt;/ref&gt;

The French mathematical physicist [[Alexis Clairaut]] assessed it in 1747: "The famous book of ''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'' marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics. The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton ... spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;(in French) Alexis Clairaut, "Du systeme du monde, dans les principes de la gravitation universelle", in "Histoires (&amp; Memoires) de l'Academie Royale des Sciences" for 1745 (published 1749), at p.329 (according to a note on p.329, Clairaut's paper was read at a session of November 1747).&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton's theories was not immediate, by the end of a century after publication in 1687, "no one could deny that" (out of the ''Principia'') "a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally."&lt;ref&gt;G E Smith, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/newton-principia/ "Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), E N Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In formulating his physical theories, Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of [[calculus]]. But the language of calculus as we know it was largely absent from the ''Principia''; Newton gave many of his proofs in a [[geometry|geometric]] form of [[infinitesimal calculus]], based on limits of ratios of vanishing small geometric quantities.&lt;ref name="geomcalc"/&gt; In a revised conclusion to the ''Principia'' (see ''[[#General Scholium|General Scholium]]''), Newton used his expression that became famous, ''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]'' ("I formulate no hypotheses"&lt;ref name="gschol-hnf"/&gt;).

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) author of the ''Principia'']]
In the preface of the ''Principia'', Newton wrote:&lt;ref&gt;From Motte's translation of 1729 (at 3rd page of Author's Preface); and see also [[J. W. Herivel]], ''The background to Newton's "Principia"'', Oxford University Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|[...] Rational Mechanics will be the sciences of motion resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motion, accurately proposed and demonstrated [...] And therefore we offer this work as mathematical principles of his philosophy. For all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this—from the phenomenas of motions to investigate the forces of Nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena [...]}}

The ''Principia'' deals primarily with massive bodies in motion, initially under a variety of conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed. It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles. It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces. Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites.

It shows:
*how astronomical observations prove the inverse square law of gravitation (to an accuracy that was high by the standards of Newton's time); 
*offers estimates of relative masses for the known giant planets and for the Earth and the Sun; 
*defines the very slow motion of the Sun relative to the solar-system barycenter; 
*shows how the theory of gravity can account for irregularities in the motion of the Moon; 
*identifies the oblateness of the figure of the Earth; 
*accounts approximately for marine tides including phenomena of spring and neap tides by the perturbing (and varying) gravitational attractions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's waters; 
*explains the [[Axial_precession#Polar_shift_and_equinoxes_shift|precession of the equinoxes]] as an effect of the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge; and 
*gives theoretical basis for numerous phenomena about comets and their elongated, near-parabolic orbits.

The opening sections of the ''Principia'' contain, in revised and extended form, nearly&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' article indicates the topics that reappear in the ''Principia.''&lt;/ref&gt; all of the content of Newton's 1684 tract ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]''.

The ''Principia'' begin with "Definitions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1|chapter=Definitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Axioms or Laws of Motion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=19|chapter=Axioms or Laws of Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues in three books:

===Book 1, ''De motu corporum''===
Book 1, subtitled ''De motu corporum'' (''On the motion of bodies'') concerns motion in the absence of any resisting medium.  It opens with a mathematical exposition of "the method of first and last ratios",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=41|chapter=Section I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus.&lt;ref name=geomcalc /&gt;

This is true for any fixed time interval. When the interval tends to zero, the force can be considered instantaneous. (Click image for a detailed description).]]
The second section establishes relationships between centripetal forces and the law of areas now known as Kepler's second law (Propositions 1–3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=57|chapter=Section II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates circular velocity and radius of path-curvature to radial force&lt;ref&gt;This relationship between circular curvature, speed and radial force, now often known as Huygens' formula, was independently found by Newton (in the 1660s) and by Huygens in the 1650s: the conclusion was published (without proof) by Huygens in 1673.This was given by Isaac Newton through his Inverse Square Law.&lt;/ref&gt; (Proposition 4), and relationships between centripetal forces varying as the inverse-square of the distance to the center and orbits of conic-section form (Propositions 5–10).

Propositions 11–31&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=79–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; establish properties of motion in paths of eccentric conic-section form including ellipses, and their relation with inverse-square central forces directed to a focus, and include [[Newton's theorem about ovals]] (lemma 28).

Propositions 43–45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=177|chapter=Section IX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178-IA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; are demonstration that in an eccentric orbit under centripetal force where the [[apsis|apse]] may move, a steady non-moving orientation of the line of apses is an indicator of an inverse-square law of force.

Book 1 contains some proofs with little connection to real-world dynamics. But there are also sections with far-reaching application to the solar system and universe:

Propositions 57–69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=218|chapter=Section XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the "motion of bodies drawn to one another by centripetal forces". This section is of primary interest for its application to the solar system, and includes Proposition 66&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=234|chapter=Section XI, Proposition LXVI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with its 22 corollaries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=239–256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA239|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; here Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions, a problem which later gained name and fame (among other reasons, for its great difficulty) as the [[three-body problem]].

Propositions 70–84&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=263|chapter=Section XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the attractive forces of spherical bodies. The section contains Newton's proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre. This fundamental result, called the [[Shell theorem]], enables the inverse square law of gravitation to be applied to the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation.

===Book 2===
Part of the contents originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book, which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance; thus &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-I|Section 1]]&lt;/span&gt; discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity, and &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-II|Section 2]]&lt;/span&gt; goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity. Book 2 also discusses (in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-V|Section 5]]&lt;/span&gt;) hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids. The effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-VI|Section 6]]&lt;/span&gt;, along with Newton's account of experiments that he carried out, to try to find out some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions. Newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties (material, weight, size). In Section 8, he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation(Proposition 48;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=176|chapter=Proposition 48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA176|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; this would become very important in acoustics). He assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|chapter=Scholium to proposition 50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA181|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less of Book 2 has stood the test of time than of Books 1 and 3, and it has been said that Book 2 was largely written on purpose to refute a theory of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] which had some wide acceptance before Newton's work (and for some time after). According to this Cartesian theory of vortices, planetary motions were produced by the whirling of fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space and carried the planets along with them.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J Aiton, ''The Cartesian vortex theory'', chapter 11 in ''Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics, Part A: Tycho Brahe to Newton'', eds. R Taton &amp; C Wilson, Cambridge (Cambridge University press) 1989; at pp. 207–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote at the end of Book 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|chapter=Scholium to proposition 53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA197|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; his conclusion that the hypothesis of vortices was completely at odds with the astronomical phenomena, and served not so much to explain as to confuse them.

===Book 3, ''De mundi systemate''===
Book 3, subtitled ''De mundi systemate'' (''On the system of the world''), is an exposition of many consequences of universal gravitation, especially its consequences for astronomy. It builds upon the propositions of the previous books, and applies them with further specificity than in Book 1 to the motions observed in the solar system. Here (introduced by Proposition 22,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA252|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in Propositions 25–35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA262|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are developed [[Lunar theory#Newton|several of the features and irregularities]] of the orbital motion of the Moon, especially the [[Variation (astronomy)|variation]].

In Book 3 Newton also made clear his heliocentric view of the solar system, modified in a somewhat modern way, since already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233]).&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=233|chapter=Proposition 12, Corollary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this centre "either is at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line".&lt;ref name=prop11&gt;{{cite book|page=232|chapter=Proposition 11 &amp; preceding Hypothesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton rejected the second alternative after adopting the position that "the centre of the system of the world is immoveable", which "is acknowledg'd by all, while some contend that the Earth, others, that the Sun is fix'd in that centre".&lt;ref name=prop11/&gt; Newton estimated the mass ratios Sun:Jupiter and Sun:Saturn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=228|chapter=Proposition 8, Corollary 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA228|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out that these put the centre of the Sun usually a little way off the common center of gravity, but only a little, the distance at most "would scarcely amount to one diameter of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=232–233|chapter=Proposition 12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}} Newton's position is seen to go beyond literal Copernican heliocentrism practically to the modern position in regard to the solar system barycenter (see ''[[Barycenter#Inside or outside the Sun.3F|Barycenter -- Inside or outside the Sun?]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on the ''Principia''===
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}
The sequence of definitions used in setting up dynamics in the ''Principia'' is recognisable in many textbooks today. Newton first set out the definition of mass

{{quotation|The quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude. A body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity. This quantity I designate by the name of body or of mass.}}

This was then used to define the "quantity of motion" (today called [[momentum]]), and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous Cartesian notion of ''intrinsic force''. This then set the stage for the introduction of forces through the change in momentum of a body. Curiously, for today's readers, the exposition looks dimensionally incorrect, since Newton does not introduce the dimension of time in rates of changes of quantities.

He defined space and time "not as they are well known to all". Instead, he defined "true" time and space as "absolute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; and explained:

{{quotation|Only I must observe, that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to perceptible objects. And it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common. [...] instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common affairs; but in philosophical discussions, we ought to step back from our senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only perceptible measures of them.}}

To some modern readers it can appear that some dynamical quantities recognised today were used in the ''Principia'' but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, [[John Locke|Locke]] asked [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] whether he could trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.

However, the concept of an attractive force acting at a distance received a cooler response. In his notes, Newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter. However, he retracted this sentence in the published version, where he stated that the motion of planets is consistent with an inverse square law, but refused to speculate on the origin of the law. Huygens and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] noted that the law was incompatible with the notion of the [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. From a Cartesian point of view, therefore, this was a faulty theory. Newton's defence has been adopted since by many famous physicists—he pointed out that the mathematical form of the theory had to be correct since it explained the data, and he refused to speculate further on the basic nature of gravity. The sheer number of phenomena that could be organised by the theory was so impressive that younger "philosophers" soon adopted the methods and language of the ''Principia''.

===Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy===
Perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding, Newton included at the beginning of Book 3 (in the second (1713) and third (1726) editions) a section entitled "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy." In the four rules, as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them. The four Rules of the 1726 edition run as follows (omitting some explanatory comments that follow each):

Rule 1: ''We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.''

Rule 2: ''Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.''

Rule 3: ''The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.''

Rule 4: ''In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, not withstanding any contrary hypothesis that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.''

This section of Rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of 'Phenomena', in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations, that Newton used as the basis for inferences later on, as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time.

Both the 'Rules' and the 'Phenomena' evolved from one edition of the ''Principia'' to the next. Rule 4 made its appearance in the third (1726) edition; Rules 1–3 were present as 'Rules' in the second (1713) edition, and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687, but there they had a different heading:  they were not given as 'Rules', but rather in the first (1687) edition the predecessors of the three later 'Rules', and of most of the later 'Phenomena', were all lumped together under a single heading 'Hypotheses' (in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later Rule 3).

From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings 'Rules' and 'Phenomena' to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements.

In the third (1726) edition of the ''Principia'', Newton explains each rule in an alternative way and/or gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming.  The first rule is explained as a philosophers' principle of economy.  The second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect, then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind:  for example respiration in humans and in animals, fires in the home and in the Sun, or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets.  An extensive explanation is given of the third rule, concerning the qualities of bodies, and Newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results, with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments, and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space.

Isaac Newton’s statement of the four rules revolutionised the investigation of phenomena. With these rules, Newton could in principle begin to address all of the world’s present unsolved mysteries.  He was able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]’s experimental method. The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists use it today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===General Scholium===
{{Main|General Scholium}}
The ''General Scholium'' is a concluding essay added to the second edition, 1713 (and amended in the third edition, 1726).&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA387 starting at page 387 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with the ''General Scholium'' at the end of Book 2, Section 6, which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air, water, and other fluids.

Here Newton used what became his famous expression '''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]''', "I formulate no hypotheses",&lt;ref name=gschol-hnf /&gt; in response to criticisms of the first edition of the ''Principia''. (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Fingo'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is sometimes nowadays translated 'feign' rather than the traditional 'frame'.) Newton's gravitational attraction, an invisible [[Action at a distance (physics)|force able to act over vast distances]], had led to criticism that he had introduced "[[occult]] agencies" into science.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"&gt;Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{ISBN|0-940262-45-2}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction, as they did; but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena: such hypotheses "have no place in experimental philosophy", in contrast to the proper way in which "particular propositions are inferr'd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction".&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA392 at page 392 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions, of Descartes, pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets, which carry them "through all parts of the heavens indifferently".

Newton also gave theological argument. From the system of the world, he inferred the existence of a Lord God, along lines similar to what is sometimes called the [[Teleological argument|argument from intelligent or purposive design]]. It has been suggested that Newton gave "an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of God and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]",&lt;ref name="The General Scholium to Isaac Newton's ''Principia mathematica''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ducheyne | first =Steffen | authorlink = | title =The General Scholium: Some notes on Newton's published and unpublished endeavours | journal=Lias: Sources and Documents Relating to the Early Modern History of Ideas |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=223–274 | url =http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/GS.pdf  | accessdate =19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the General Scholium appears to say nothing specifically about these matters.

==Writing and publication==

===Halley and Newton's initial stimulus===
In January 1684, [[Edmond Halley]], [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]] had a conversation in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of planetary motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase of 1686 report by Halley, in H. W. Turnbull (ed.), 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol.2, cited above, pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley's visits to Newton in 1684 thus resulted from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, and they seem to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''. Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the [[Royal Society]] in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk).&lt;ref&gt;'Cook, 1998': A. Cook, ''Edmond Halley, Charting the Heavens and the Seas'', Oxford University Press 1998, at pp.147 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August.&lt;ref&gt;As dated e.g. by D. T. Whiteside, in ''The Prehistory of the Principia from 1664 to 1686'', Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 45 (1991) 11–61.&lt;/ref&gt; When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago; but that he could not find the papers. (Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and [[Abraham De Moivre]] to whom Newton confided.) Halley then had to wait for Newton to 'find' the results, but in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject. This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (''Of the motion of bodies in an orbit''): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without title.

Newton's tract ''De motu corporum in gyrum'', which he sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are now known as the three laws of Kepler, assuming an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of ''De motu'' so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work.&lt;ref&gt;'Westfall, 1980': R S Westfall, ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'', Cambridge University Press 1980, at p.404.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's single-minded attention to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p. 406, also pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the ''Principia'': Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p.406, n.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.

The first of the three constituent books was sent to Halley for the printer in spring 1686, and the other two books somewhat later.  The complete work, published by Halley at his own financial risk,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at pp. 153–156.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in July 1687.  Newton had also communicated ''De motu'' to Flamsteed, and during the period of composition he exchanged a few letters with Flamsteed about observational data on the planets, eventually acknowledging Flamsteed's contributions in the published version of the ''Principia'' of 1687.

===Preliminary version===
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] own first edition copy of his ''Principia'', with handwritten corrections for the second edition.]]
The process of writing that first edition of the ''Principia'' went through several stages and drafts:  some parts of the preliminary materials still survive, while others are lost except for fragments and cross-references in other documents.&lt;ref&gt;The fundamental study of Newton's progress in writing the ''Principia'' is in I. Bernard Cohen's ''Introduction to Newton's 'Principia' '', (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1971), at part 2: "The writing and first publication of the 'Principia' ", pp.47–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving materials show that Newton (up to some time in 1685) conceived his book as a two-volume work. The first volume was to be titled ''De motu corporum, Liber primus'', with contents that later appeared in extended form as Book 1 of the ''Principia''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A fair-copy draft of Newton's planned second volume ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' survives, its completion dated to about the summer of 1685.  It covers the application of the results of ''Liber primus'' to the Earth, the Moon, the tides, the solar system, and the universe; in this respect it has much the same purpose as the final Book 3 of the ''Principia'', but it is written much less formally and is more easily read.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Manchester John Rylands Library Isaac Newton 16-10-2009 13-54-26.JPG|thumb|left|Titlepage and frontispiece of the third edition, London, 1726 ([[John Rylands Library]])]]
It is not known just why Newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' of 1685, but he largely started afresh in a new, tighter, and less accessible mathematical style, eventually to produce Book 3 of the ''Principia'' as we know it. Newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had (first) composed this book "in a popular method, that it might be read by many", but to "prevent the disputes" by readers who could not "lay aside the[ir] prejudices", he had "reduced" it "into the form of propositions (in the mathematical way) which should be read by those only, who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=200|chapter=Introduction to Book 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA200|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by Newton in the meantime, especially about the theory of the motions of comets, and some of the perturbations of the motions of the Moon.

The result was numbered Book 3 of the ''Principia'' rather than Book 2, because in the meantime, drafts of ''Liber primus'' had expanded and Newton had divided it into two books. The new and final Book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

But the ''Liber secundus'' of 1685 can still be read today. Even after it was superseded by Book 3 of the ''Principia'', it survived complete, in more than one manuscript. After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs). It appeared under the English title ''A Treatise of the System of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1|title=A Treatise of the System of the World|author1=Newton|first1=Isaac|date=1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the ''Principia''. Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title ''De Mundi Systemate'', amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the ''Principia'', making it look superficially as if it had been written by Newton after the ''Principia'', rather than before.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, ''Introduction'' to Newton's ''A Treatise of the System of the World'' (facsimile of second English edition of 1731), London (Dawsons of Pall Mall) 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''System of the World'' was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a 'corrected' reprint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02xbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP7|title=The System of the World: Demonstrated in an Easy and Popular Manner.

===Halley's role as publisher===
The text of the first of the three books of the ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]] at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. [[Samuel Pepys]], as President, gave his [[imprimatur]] on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a ''[[De Historia piscium|History of Fishes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Westfall (1980), ''Never at Rest'', p. 453, {{ISBN|0-521-27435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cost of publication was borne by [[Edmund Halley]] (who was also then acting as publisher of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society''): the book appeared in summer 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |title=Museum of London exhibit including facsimile of title page from John Flamsteed's copy of 1687 edition of Newton's '&amp;#39;Principia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Museumoflondon.org.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331192529/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |archivedate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) was the first person to formulate a comprehensive [[Heliocentricism|heliocentric]] (or [[Sun]]-centered) model of the universe]]
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] had moved the Earth away from the center of the universe with the [[heliocentric]] theory for which he presented evidence in his book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres'') published in 1543. The structure was completed when [[Johannes Kepler]] wrote the book ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A new astronomy'') in 1609, setting out the evidence that planets move in [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits with the sun at one [[Focus (geometry)|focus]], and that planets do not move with constant speed along this orbit. Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. To these two laws he added a third a decade later, in his book ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonies of the world''). This law sets out a proportionality between the third power of the characteristic distance of a planet from the sun and the square of the length of its year.

[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|Italian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a champion of the Copernican model of the universe and an enormously influential figure in the history of kinematics and classical mechanics]]The foundation of modern dynamics was set out in Galileo's book ''[[Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo]]'' (''Dialogue on the two main world systems'') where the notion of inertia was implicit and used. In addition, Galileo's experiments with inclined planes had yielded precise mathematical relations between elapsed time and acceleration, velocity or distance for uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of bodies.

Descartes' book of 1644 ''[[Principia philosophiae]]'' (''Principles of philosophy'') stated that bodies can act on each other only through contact: a principle that induced people, among them himself, to hypothesize a universal medium as the carrier of interactions such as light and gravity—the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Newton was criticized for apparently introducing forces that acted at distance without any medium.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"/&gt; Not until the development of [[particle theory]] was Descartes' notion vindicated when it was possible to describe all interactions, like the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental interaction]]s, using mediating [[gauge boson]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics|title=Particle Physics and Astrophysics Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gravity through hypothesized [[gravitons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Rovelli|first1=Carlo|title=Notes for a brief history of quantum gravity|eprint=gr-qc/0006061|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was mistaken in his treatment of circular motion, this effort was more fruitful in the short term when it led others to identify circular motion as a problem raised by the principle of inertia. [[Christiaan Huygens]] solved this problem in the 1650s and published it much later in 1673 in his book ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum]]''.

===Newton's role===
Newton had studied these books, or, in some cases, secondary sources based on them, and taken notes entitled ''[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae]]'' (''Questions about philosophy'') during his days as an undergraduate. During this period (1664–1666) he created the basis of calculus, and performed the first experiments in the optics of colour. At this time, his proof that white light was a combination of primary colours (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colours and received an overwhelmingly favourable response, and occasioned bitter disputes with [[Robert Hooke]] and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book ''[[Opticks]]'' by the 1670s in response. Work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters, including two to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] (succeeding [[Isaac Barrow]]) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

===Newton's early work on motion===
In the 1660s Newton studied the motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called [[centrifugal force]]) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Bruce Brackenridge, "The key to Newton's dynamics: the Kepler problem and the Principia", (University of California Press, 1995), especially at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovOTK7X_mMkC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pages 20–21].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.&lt;ref name="dtw1970"/&gt;

===Controversy with Hooke===
[[File:13 Portrait of Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|Artist's impression of English polymath [[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703).]]
Hooke published [[Robert Hooke#Gravitation|his ideas about gravitation]] in the 1660s and again in 1674. He argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' of 1665, in a 1666 Royal Society lecture ''On gravity'', and again in 1674, when he published his ideas about the ''System of the World'' in somewhat developed form, as an addition to ''An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations''.&lt;ref name="attempt"/&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body, along with a principle of linear inertia. Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233–274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e., "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke began an exchange of letters with Newton, of which the full text is now published.&lt;ref name="167986letters"/&gt;  Hooke told Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence,&lt;ref&gt;'Correspondence' vol.2 already cited, at p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; and wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others;  and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered "a fansy of my own" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.&lt;ref&gt;Several commentators have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the following facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping "a heavy body suspended in the Air" (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at page 301, 'Correspondence' vol.2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter "supposing no resistance", see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at page 259); and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote "where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in wch it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C". Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pages 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also available online: see Curtis Wilson, chapter 13 in "Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton", (Cambridge UP 1989), at page 241 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 Newton's 1679 diagram] with spiral, and extract of his letter; also at page 242 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 Hooke's 1679 diagram] including two paths, closed curve and spiral. Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral "is true in a resisting medium such as our air is", see 'Correspondence', vol.2 cited above, at page 433, document #286.&lt;/ref&gt; A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;See page 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson (1989) at page 244.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1686, when the first book of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]], Hooke claimed that Newton had obtained from him the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center". At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1660s," the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;ref&gt;See "Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'", Ofer Gal, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 9].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid "at great distances from the center".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

The background described above shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke. On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the ''Principia'', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it ...".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;)   Newton's reawakening interest in astronomy received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680/1681, on which he corresponded with [[John Flamsteed]].&lt;ref&gt;R S Westfall, 'Never at Rest', 1980, at pages 391–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; "The example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), page 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", [and] "L'exemple de Hook" [serves] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later editions==
Two later editions were published by Newton:

===Second edition, 1713===
Newton had been urged to make a new edition of the ''Principia'' since the early 1690s, partly because copies of the first edition had already become very rare and expensive within a few years after 1687.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University Press 1967, at pp.519, n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with Flamsteed in November 1694:&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions; two of these copies still survive:&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen, Introduction to the Principia, Cambridge 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not completed the revisions by 1708, and of two would-be editors, Newton had almost severed connections with one, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], and the other, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] seems not to have met with Newton's approval and was also terminally ill, dying later in 1708. Nevertheless, reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard S. Westfall]]. ''Never at Rest'': A Biography of Isaac Newton. Cambridge U. Press. 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-23143-4}}, at p.699.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Bentley]], master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], persuaded Newton to allow him to undertake a second edition, and in June 1708 Bentley wrote to Newton with a specimen print of the first sheet, at the same time expressing the (unfulfilled) hope that Newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at pp.518–20.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed [[Roger Cotes]], Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit). The correspondence of 1709–1713 shows Cotes reporting to two masters, Bentley and Newton, and managing (and often correcting) a large and important set of revisions to which Newton sometimes could not give his full attention.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.5, Cambridge University press 1975. Bentley's letter to Newton of October 1709 (at pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8) describes Cotes' perhaps unenviable position in relation to his master Bentley: "You need not be so shy of giving Mr. Cotes too much trouble: he has more esteem for you, and obligations to you, than to think that trouble too grievous: but however he does it at my Orders, to whom he owes more than that."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the weight of Cotes' efforts, but impeded by priority disputes between Newton and Leibniz,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.712–716.&lt;/ref&gt; and by troubles at the Mint,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.751–760.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes was able to announce publication to Newton on 30 June 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.750.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley sent Newton only six presentation copies; Cotes was unpaid; Newton omitted any acknowledgement to Cotes.

Among those who gave Newton corrections for the Second Edition were: [[Firmin Abauzit]], Roger Cotes and David Gregory. However, Newton omitted acknowledgements to some because of the priority disputes. [[John Flamsteed]], the Astronomer Royal, suffered this especially.

The Second Edition was the basis of the first edition to be printed abroad, which appeared in Amsterdam in 1714.

===Third edition, 1726===
The third edition was published 25 March 1726, under the stewardship of ''[[Henry Pemberton]], M.D., a man of the greatest skill in these matters...''; Pemberton later said that this recognition was worth more to him than the two hundred guinea award from Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.802&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annotated and other editions===
In 1739–42, two French priests, Pères Thomas LeSeur and [[François Jacquier]] (of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minim]] order, but sometimes erroneously identified as Jesuits), produced with the assistance of [[Jean-Louis Calandrini|J.-L. Calandrini]] an extensively annotated version of the ''Principia'' in the 3rd edition of 1726. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''Jesuit edition'': it was much used, and reprinted more than once in Scotland during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Facsimile"/&gt;

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] also made a translation of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to have been done in French and hers remains the standard French translation to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See "Translating Newton's 'Principia': The Marquise du Châtelet's Revisions and Additions for a French Audience." Author(s): Judith P. Zinsser Source: ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (May 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English translations===
Two full English translations of Newton's ''Principia'' have appeared, both based on Newton's 3rd edition of 1726.

The first, from 1729, by Andrew Motte,&lt;ref name="Motte"/&gt; was described by Newton scholar [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (in 1968) as "still of enormous value in conveying to us the sense of Newton's words in their own time, and it is generally faithful to the original: clear, and well written".&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen (1968), "Introduction" (at page i) to (facsimile) reprint of 1729 English translation of Newton's "Principia" (London (1968), Dawsons of Pall Mall).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1729 version was the basis for several republications, often incorporating revisions, among them a widely used modernised English version of 1934, which appeared under the editorial name of Florian Cajori (though completed and published only some years after his death). Cohen pointed out ways in which the 18th-century terminology and punctuation of the 1729 translation might be confusing to modern readers, but he also made severe criticisms of the 1934 modernised English version, and showed that the revisions had been made without regard to the original, also demonstrating gross errors "that provided the final impetus to our decision to produce a wholly new translation".&lt;ref&gt;See pages 29–37 in [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (1999), "A Guide to Newton's Principia", published as an introduction to "Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation" by I Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, University of California Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second full English translation, into modern English, is the work that resulted from this decision by collaborating translators I. Bernard Cohen, Anne Whitman, and Julia Budenz; it was published in 1999 with a guide by way of introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation'' by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, preceded by "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I. Bernard Cohen, University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08816-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08817-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Donahue has published a translation of the work's central argument, published in 1996, along with expansion of included proofs and ample commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue, ''Newton's Principia: The Central Argument: Translation, Notes, and Expanded Proofs'' (Green Lion Press; 3rd edition, 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was developed as a textbook for classes at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Densmore and Donahue, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homages===
In 2014, British [[astronaut]] [[Tim Peake]] named his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]] ''Principia'' after the book, in "honour of Britain's greatest scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28329097|title=Tim Peake mission name pays tribute to Isaac Newton|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Peake's ''Principia'' launched on December 15, 2015 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-19M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/06/09/roscosmos-announces-new-soyuzprogress-launch-dates/?linkId=14819770|title=Roscosmos Announces New Soyuz/Progress Launch Dates|date=9 June 2015|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''potentiality and actuality'''&lt;ref&gt;''dynamis&amp;ndash;energeia'', translated into Latin as ''potentia&amp;ndash;actualitas'' (earlier also ''possibilitas&amp;ndash;efficacia''). Giorgio Agamben, ''Opus Dei: An Archaeology of Duty'' (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yVYTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46  p. 46].&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of closely connected principles which [[Aristotle]] used to analyze [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Four causes|causality]], [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]], and [[physiology]] in his ''[[Aristotelian physics|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[De Anima]]'', which is about the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].&lt;ref name="Sachs2005"/&gt;

The concept of potentiality, in this context, generally refers to any "possibility" that a thing can be said to have. Aristotle did not consider all possibilities the same, and emphasized the importance of those that become real of their own accord when conditions are right and nothing stops them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999|p=lvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a possibility becomes real in the fullest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These concepts, in modified forms, remained very important into the [[middle ages]], influencing the development of [[medieval theology]] in several ways. Going further into modern times, while the understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], and according to some interpretations [[deity]], implied by the dichotomy lost importance, the terminology has found new uses, developing indirectly from the old. This is most obvious in words like "energy" and "dynamic"--words first used in modern physics by the German scientist and philosopher, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].   Another example is the highly controversial biological concept of an "[[Potentiality and actuality#Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology|entelechy]]".

==Potentiality==
'''Potentiality''' and '''potency''' are translations of the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''dunamis'' ([[wikt:δύναμις|δύναμις]]) as it is used by Aristotle as a concept contrasting with actuality. Its [[Latin]] translation is "''[[wikt:potentia|potentia]]''", root of the English word potential, and used by some scholars instead of the Greek or English variants.

''Dunamis'' is an ordinary Greek word for possibility or capability. Depending on context, it could be translated "potency", "potential", "capacity", "ability", "power", "capability", "strength", "possibility", "force" and is the root of modern [[English language|English]] words "dynamic", "dynamite", and "dynamo".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dunamis&amp;la=greek&amp;prior= Perseus dictionary references] for ''dunamis''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern]] philosophy, English authors like [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] used the English word "power" as their translation of Latin ''potentia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Locke|1689|loc=chpt. XXI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his philosophy, Aristotle distinguished two meanings of the word ''dunamis''. According to his understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] there was both a weak sense of potential, meaning simply that something "might chance to happen or not to happen", and a stronger sense, to indicate how something could be done ''well''. For example, "sometimes we say that those who can merely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they intended, cannot speak or walk". This stronger sense is mainly said of the potentials of living things, although it is also sometimes used for things like musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019a 1019a] - [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019b 1019b]. The translations used are those of Tredennick on the [[Perseus project]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his works, Aristotle clearly distinguishes things that are stable or persistent, with their own strong natural tendency to a specific type of change, from things that appear to occur by chance. He treats these as having a different and more real existence. "[[Nature (philosophy)|Natures]] which persist" are said by him to be one of the causes of all things, while natures that do not persist, "might often be slandered as not being at all by one who fixes his thinking sternly upon it as upon a criminal". The potencies which persist in a particular material are one way of describing "the nature itself" of that material, an innate source of motion and rest within that material. In terms of Aristotle's theory of [[four causes]], a material's non-accidental potential, is the material cause of the things that can come to be from that material, and one part of how we can understand the [[substance theory|substance]] (''[[ousia]]'', sometimes translated as "thinghood") of any separate thing. (As emphasized by Aristotle, this requires his distinction between [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]] causes and natural causes.)&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192a18. Translation from {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, when we refer to the nature of a thing, we are referring to the form, shape or look of a thing, which was already present as a potential, an innate tendency to change, in that material before it achieved that form, but things show what they are more fully, as a real thing, when they are "fully at work".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 193b. ({{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=51}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actuality==
'''Actuality''' is often used to translate both ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29nerge%2Fw&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29nerga/zomai energeia]'' ([[wikt:ενέργεια|ενέργεια]]) and ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29ntele%2Fxeia&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29ntele/w#lexicon entelecheia]'' ([[wikt:ἐντελέχεια|ἐντελέχεια]]) (sometimes rendered in English as ''"[[wikt:entelechy|entelechy]]"''). "Actuality" comes from Latin ''{{linktext|actualitas}}'' and is a traditional translation, but its normal meaning in Latin is "anything which is currently happening".

The two words ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' were coined by Aristotle, and he stated that their meanings were intended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1047a Metaphysics 1047a30], in the {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}} translation: "the phrase being-at-work, which is designed to converge in meaning with being-at-work-staying-complete". [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1047a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051 Greek is]: ἐλήλυθε δ᾽ ἡ '''ἐνέργεια''' τοὔνομα, ἡ πρὸς τὴν '''ἐντελέχειαν''' συντιθεμένη&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, most commentators and translators consider the two words to be interchangeable.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both refer to something being in its own type of action or at work, as all things are when they are real in the fullest sense, and not just potentially real. For example, "to be a rock is to strain to be at the center of the universe, and thus to be in motion unless constrained otherwise".&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;

===Energeia===
''Energeia'' is a word based upon ἔργον (''ergon''), meaning "work".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1050a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052 Metaphysics 1050a21-23]. In Tredinnick's translation: "For the activity is the end, and the actuality (''energeia'') is the activity (''ergon''); hence the term "actuality" is derived from "activity," and tends to have the meaning of "complete reality (''entelecheia'')." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] τὸ γὰρ ἔργον τέλος, ἡ δὲ ἐνέργεια τὸ ἔργον, διὸ καὶ τοὔνομα ἐνέργεια λέγεται κατὰ τὸ ἔργον καὶ συντείνει πρὸς τὴν ἐντελέχειαν.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the source of the modern word "[[energy]]" but the term has evolved so much over the course of the [[history of science]] that  reference to the modern term is not very helpful in understanding the original as used by Aristotle. It is difficult to translate his use of ''energeia'' into English with consistency. Joe Sachs renders it with the phrase "being–at–work" and says that "we might construct the word is-at-work-ness from Anglo-Saxon roots to translate ''energeia'' into English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says the word can be made clear by looking at examples rather than trying to find a definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a Metaphysics 1048a30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of ''energeiai'' in Aristotle's works are [[pleasure]] and [[happiness]] ([[eudaimonia]]). Pleasure is an ''energeia'' of the human body and mind whereas happiness is more simply the ''energeia'' of a human being a human.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book X. Chapters 1–5: The theory of Pleasure|Book X. Chapters 1–5]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kinesis'', translated as [[Motion (physics)|movement]], [[motion (physics)|motion]], or in some contexts change, is also explained by Aristotle as a particular type of ''energeia''. See below.

===Entelechy or entelechia===
Entelechy, in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''entelécheia'', was coined by Aristotle and transliterated in [[Latin]] as ''{{linktext|entelechia}}''. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristotle invents the word by combining ''entelēs'' (ἐντελής, "complete, full-grown") with ''echein'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[hexis]]'', to be a certain way by the continuing effort of holding on in that condition), while at the same time punning on ''endelecheia'' (ἐνδελέχεια, "persistence") by inserting "[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]" (τέλος, "completion"). This is a three-ring circus of a word, at the heart of everything in Aristotle's thinking, including the definition of motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sachs therefore proposed a complex neologism of his own, "being-at-work-staying-the-same".&lt;ref name=Sachs1995/&gt; Another translation in recent years is "being-at-an-end" (which Sachs has also used).&lt;ref name=Sachs2005&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Entelecheia'', as can be seen by its derivation, is a kind of completeness, whereas "the end and completion of any genuine being is its being-at-work" (''energeia''). The ''entelecheia'' is a continuous being-at-work (''energeia'') when something is doing its complete "work". For this reason, the meanings of the two words converge, and they both depend upon the idea that every thing's "thinghood" is a kind of work, or in other words a specific way of being in motion. All things that exist now, and not just potentially, are beings-at-work, and all of them have a tendency towards being-at-work in a particular way that would be their proper and "complete" way.&lt;ref name=Sachs1995&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs explains the convergence of ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' as follows, and uses the word actuality to describe the overlap between them:&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as ''energeia'' extends to ''entelecheia'' because it is the activity which makes a thing what it is, ''entelecheia'' extends to ''energeia'' because it is the end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motion==

Aristotle discusses motion (''kinēsis'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' quite differently from [[modern science]]. Aristotle's definition of motion is closely connected to his actuality-potentiality distinction. Taken literally, Aristotle defines motion as the actuality (''entelecheia'') of a "potentiality as such".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10-11, 201a27-29, 201b4-5. ''Metaphysics'' Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; What Aristotle meant however is the subject of several different interpretations. A major difficulty comes from the fact that the terms actuality and potentiality, linked in this definition, are normally understood within Aristotle as opposed to each other. On the other hand, the "as such" is important and is explained at length by Aristotle, giving examples of "potentiality as such". For example, the motion of building is the ''energeia'' of the ''dunamis'' of the building materials ''as building materials'' as opposed to anything else they might become, and this potential in the unbuilt materials is referred to by Aristotle as "the buildable". So the motion of building is the actualization of "the buildable" and not the actualization of a house as such, nor the actualization of any other possibility which the building materials might have had.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Book XI, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1066a 1066a].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential 1969 paper Aryeh Kosman divided up previous attempts to explain Aristotle's definition into two types, criticised them, and then gave his own third interpretation. While this has not become a consensus, it has been described as having become "orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09tRfDqEo4MC&amp;pg=PA8|title=Oxford Physics in the Thirteenth Century (ca. 1250-1270): Motion, Infinity, Place &amp; Time| first=Cecilia |year=2000|publisher=Brill|last=Trifogli|page=8|isbn=9004116575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar more recent publications are the basis of the following summary.

===1. The "process" interpretation===
{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|1969}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Coope|2009}} associate this approach with [[W.D. Ross]]. {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} points out that it was also the interpretation of [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].

This interpretation is, to use the words of Ross that "it is the passage to actuality that is ''kinesis''” as opposed to any potentiality being an actuality.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', text with commentary, London, 1936, p. 359, quoted by {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument of Ross for this interpretation requires him to assert that Aristotle actually used his own word ''entelecheia'' wrongly, or inconsistently, only within his definition, making it mean "actualization", which is in conflict with Aristotle's normal use of words. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} this explanation also can not account for the "as such" in Aristotle's definition.

===2. The "product" interpretation===
{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} associates this interpretation with [[St Thomas of Aquinas]] and explains that by this explanation "the apparent contradiction between potentiality and actuality in Aristotle’s definition of motion" is resolved "by arguing that in every motion actuality and potentiality are mixed or blended". Motion is therefore "the actuality of any potentiality insofar as it is still a potentiality". Or in other words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Thomistic blend of actuality and potentiality has the characteristic that, to the extent that it is actual it is not potential and to the extent that it is potential it is not actual; the hotter the water is, the less is it potentially hot, and the cooler it is, the less is it actually, the more potentially, hot.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the first interpretation however, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} objects that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One implication of this interpretation is that whatever happens to be the case right now is an ''entelechia'', as though something that is intrinsically unstable as the instantaneous position of an arrow in flight deserved to be described by the word that everywhere else Aristotle reserves for complex organized states that persist, that hold out against internal and external causes that try to destroy them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more recent paper on this subject, Kosman associates the view of Aquinas with those of his own critics, David Charles, Jonathan Beere, and Robert Heineman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|2013}}, chapter 2, footnote 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. The interpretation of Kosman, Coope, Sachs and others===

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}, amongst other authors (such as Aryeh Kosman and Ursula Coope), proposes that the solution to problems interpreting Aristotle's definition must be found in the distinction Aristotle makes between two different types of potentiality, with only one of those corresponding to the "potentiality as such" appearing in the definition of motion. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The man with sight, but with his eyes closed, differs from the blind man, although neither is seeing. The first man has the capacity to see, which the second man lacks. There are then potentialities as well as actualities in the world. But when the first man opens his eyes, has he lost the capacity to see? Obviously not; while he is seeing, his capacity to see is no longer merely a potentiality, but is a potentiality which has been put to work. The potentiality to see exists sometimes as active or at-work, and sometimes as inactive or latent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming to motion, Sachs gives the example of a man walking across the room and says that...
*"Once he has reached the other side of the room, his potentiality to be there has been actualized in Ross’ sense of the term". This is a type of ''energeia''. However it is not a motion, and not relevant to the definition of motion.
*''While'' a man is walking his potentiality to be on the other side of the room is actual ''just as a potentiality'', or in other words the potential ''as such'' is an actuality. "The actuality of the potentiality to be on the other side of the room, as just that potentiality, is neither more nor less than the walking across the room."

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|pp=78–79}}, in his commentary of Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' book III gives the following results from his understanding of Aristotle's definition of motion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The genus of which motion is a species is being-at-work-staying-itself (''entelecheia''), of which the only other species is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-itself of a potency (''dunamis''), as material, is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-the-same of a potency as a potency is motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The importance of actuality in Aristotle's philosophy==
The actuality-potentiality distinction in Aristotle is a key element linked to everything in his physics and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carrara 7.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A [[marble]] block in [[Carrara]]. Could there be a particular sculpture already existing in it as a potentiality? Aristotle wrote approvingly of such ways of talking, and felt it reflected a type of causation in nature which is often ignored in scientific discussion.]]
Aristotle describes potentiality and actuality, or potency and action, as one of several distinctions between things that exist or do not exist. In a sense, a thing that exists potentially does not exist, but the potential does exist. And this type of distinction is expressed for several different types of being within Aristotle's categories of being. For example, from Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1017a 1017a]:&lt;ref&gt;Tredennick's translation, with links to his footnote cross references, using the [[Perseus project|Perseus]] online resources: "For we say that both that which sees potentially and that which sees actually is "a seeing thing." And in the same way we call "understanding" both that which can use the understanding, and that which does ; and we call "tranquil" both that in which tranquillity is already present, and that which is potentially tranquil. Similarly too in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in the stone, (Cf. Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%203.1002a&amp;lang=original Met. 3.5.6.]'') and the half of the line in the whole; and we call "corn" what is not yet ripe. But when a thing is potentially existent and when not, must be defined elsewhere." Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%209.1051a&amp;lang=original Metaphysics 9.9.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*We speak of an entity being a "seeing" thing whether it is currently seeing or just able to see.
*We speak of someone having understanding, whether they are using that understanding or not.
*We speak of corn existing in a field even when it is not yet ripe.
*People sometimes speak of a figure being already present in a rock which could be sculpted to represent that figure.

Within the works of Aristotle the terms ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'', often translated as actuality, differ from what is merely actual because they specifically presuppose that all things have a proper kind of activity or work which, if achieved, would be their proper end. Greek for end in this sense is [[telos (philosophy)|telos]], a component word in ''entelecheia'' (a work that is the proper end of a thing) and also [[teleology]]. This is an aspect of Aristotle's [[Four causes|theory of four causes]] and specifically of formal cause (''eidos'', which Aristotle says is ''energeia''&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b 1050b]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b Greek:] ὥστε φανερὸν ὅτι ἡ οὐσία καὶ τὸ εἶδος ἐνέργειά ἐστιν.&lt;/ref&gt;) and final cause (''telos'').

In essence this means that Aristotle did not see things as matter in motion only, but also proposed that all things have their own aims or ends. In other words, for Aristotle (unlike modern science) there is a distinction between things with a natural cause in the strongest sense, and things that truly happen by accident. He also distinguishes non-rational from rational potentialities (e.g. the capacity to heat and the capacity to play the flute, respectively), pointing out that the latter require desire or deliberate choice for their actualization.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a 1048a]. The Greek words are ''orexis'' for desire and ''proairesis'' for deliberate choice.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this style of reasoning, Aristotle is often referred to as having a [[teleology]], and sometimes as having a [[theory of forms]].

While actuality is linked by Aristotle to his concept of a [[formal cause]], potentiality (or potency) on the other hand, is linked by Aristotle to his concepts of [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic matter]] and [[material cause]]. Aristotle wrote for example that "matter exists potentially, because it may attain to the form; but when it exists actually, it is then in the form".&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a 1050a15]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] ἔτι ἡ ὕλη ἔστι δυνάμει ὅτι ἔλθοι ἂν εἰς τὸ εἶδος: ὅταν δέ γε ἐνεργείᾳ ᾖ, τότε ἐν τῷ εἴδει ἐστίν&lt;/ref&gt;

==The active intellect==
{{Main article|Active Intellect}}
The active intellect was a concept Aristotle described that requires an understanding of the actuality-potentiality dichotomy. Aristotle described this in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' (book 3, ch. 5, 430a10-25) and covered similar ground in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (book 12, ch.7-10). The following is from the ''De Anima'', translated by Joe Sachs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some parenthetic notes about the Greek. The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself:&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;-
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in '''potency''' all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''[[nous]]''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors '''that are in potency be at work as''' colors [''to phōs poiei ta '''dunamei''' onta chrōmata '''energeiai''' chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a '''[[being-at-work]]''', for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its '''being-at-work''', is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in '''potency''' comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been referred to as one of "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{harvtxt|Davidson|1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle wrote at more length on a similar subject and is often understood to have equated the active intellect with being the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]]. Nevertheless, as Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains [[wikt:moot|moot]] to this day. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-Aristotelian usage==

===New meanings of ''energeia'' or energy===

Already in Aristotle's own works, the concept of a distinction between ''energeia'' and ''dunamis'' was used in many ways, for example to describe the way striking metaphors work,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Rh.+1411b&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060 1411b]&lt;/ref&gt; or human happiness. [[Polybius]] about 150 BC, in his work the ''Histories'' uses Aristotle's word ''energeia'' in both an Aristotelian way and also to describe the "clarity and vividness" of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] in 60-30 BC used the term in a very similar way to Polybius. However Diodorus uses the term to denote qualities unique to individuals. Using the term in ways that could translated as "vigor" or "[[energy]]" (in a more modern sense); for society, "practice" or "custom"; for a thing, "operation" or "working"; like vigor in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoplatonism===
[[Plotinus]] was a late classical pagan philosopher and theologian whose [[monotheism|monotheistic]] re-workings of Plato and Aristotle were influential amongst early Christian theologians. In his ''[[Enneads]]'' he sought to reconcile ideas of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] together with a form of [[monotheism]], that used three fundamental metaphysical principles, which were conceived of in terms consistent with Aristotle's energeia/dunamis dichotomy, and one interpretation of his concept of the Active Intellect (discussed above):-
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]". This is the ''dunamis'' or possibility of existence.
*The Intellect, or Intelligence, or, to use the Greek term, ''[[Nous]]'', which is described as God, or a ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] or, to use the Greek term, ''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''. The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence".
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[Unmoved Mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essence-energies debate in medieval Christian theology===
{{details|Essence-Energies distinction}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity, St [[Gregory Palamas]] wrote about the "energies" (actualities; singular ''energeia'' in Greek, or ''actus'' in Latin) of God in contrast to God's "[[essence]]" (''ousia''). These are two distinct types of existence, with God's energy being the type of existence which people can perceive, while the essence of God is outside of normal existence or non-existence or human understanding, in that it is not caused or created by anything else.

Palamas gave this explanation as part of his defense of the Eastern Orthodox [[asceticism|ascetic]] practice of [[hesychasm]]. Palamism became a standard part of Orthodox dogma after 1351.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=Gregory Palamas: An Historical Overview |url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas:_An_Historical_Overview |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014640/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas%3A_An_Historical_Overview |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the position of Western Medieval (or Catholic) Christianity, can be found for example in the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]], who relied on Aristotle's concept of entelechy, when he defined God as ''actus purus'', [[pure act]], actuality unmixed with potentiality. The existence of a truly distinct essence of God which is not actuality, is not generally accepted in Catholic Theology.

===Influence on modal logic===

The notion of possibility was greatly analyzed by medieval and modern philosophers. Aristotle's logical work in this area is considered by some to be an anticipation of [[Modal logic#Development of modal logic|modal logic]] and its treatment of potentiality and time. Indeed, many philosophical interpretations of possibility are related to a famous passage on Aristotle's ''[[On Interpretation]]'', concerning the truth of the statement: "There will be a sea battle tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/AristotleOrganon/AristotleOrganoncollectedWorks#page/n57/mode/1up/search/sea-fight copy] of W.D. Ross's translation scanned on Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contemporary philosophy]] regards possibility, as studied by [[Modal logic#Metaphysical possibility|modal metaphysics]], to be an aspect of [[modal logic]]. Modal logic as a named subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]].

===Influence on modern physics===

Aristotle's metaphysics, his account of nature and causality, was for the most part rejected by the [[early modern]] philosophers. [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[Novum Organon]]'' in one explanation of the case for rejecting the concept of a formal cause or "nature" for each type of thing, argued for example that philosophers must still look for formal causes but only in the sense of "simple natures" such as [[colour]], and [[weight]], which exist in many gradations and modes in very different types of individual bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Book II, aphorism V&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]] then, the traditional Aristotelian terms, "''potentia et actus''", are discussed, but he equates them simply to "cause and effect".&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Corpore]]'' chapter X (in [https://archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog#page/n261/mode/1up Latin]; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=power&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%20X&amp;f=false English]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], the source of the modern adaptations of Aristotle's concepts of potentiality and actuality.]]

There was an adaptation of at least one aspect of Aristotle's potentiality and actuality distinction, which has become part of modern physics, although as per Bacon's approach it is a generalized form of energy, not one connected to specific forms for specific things. The definition of [[energy]] in modern [[physics]] as the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of [[mass]] and the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of [[velocity]], was derived by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], as a correction of [[Descartes]], based upon [[Galileo]]'s investigation of falling bodies. He preferred to refer to it as an ''entelecheia'' or "living force" (Latin ''vis viva''), but what he defined is today called "kinetic energy", and was seen by Leibniz as a modification of Aristotle's ''energeia'', and his concept of the potential for movement which is in things. Instead of each type of physical thing having its own specific tendency to a way of moving or changing, as in Aristotle, Leibniz said that instead, force, power, or motion itself could be transferred between things of different types, in such a way that there is a general [[Conservation of energy|conservation of this energy]]. In other words, Leibniz's modern version of entelechy or energy obeys its own laws of nature, whereas different types of things do not have their own separate laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Klein|1985}}, and {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}: "[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who criticized [[Descartes]]’ physics and invented a science of dynamics, explicitly acknowledged his debt to Aristotle (see, e.g., ''Specimen Dynamicum''), whose doctrine of ''entelecheia'' he regarded himself as restoring in a modified form. From Leibniz we derive our current notions of [[potential]] and [[kinetic energy]], whose very names, pointing to the actuality which is potential and the actuality which is motion, preserve the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] resolutions of the two paradoxes in Aristotle’s definition of motion."&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Leibniz|1890|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;...the entelechy of Aristotle, which has made so much noise, is nothing else but force or activity ; that is, a state from which action naturally flows if nothing hinders it. But matter, primary and pure, taken without the souls or lives which are united to it, is purely passive ; properly speaking also it is not a substance, but something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz's study of the "entelechy" now known as energy was a part of what he called his new science of "dynamics", based on the Greek word ''dunamis'' and his understanding that he was making a modern version of Aristotle's old dichotomy. He also referred to it as the "new science of power and action", (Latin "''potentia et effectu''" and "''potentia et actione''"). And it is from him that the modern distinction between [[statics]] and dynamics in physics stems. The emphasis on ''dunamis'' in the name of this new science comes from the importance of his discovery of [[potential energy]] which is not active, but which conserves energy nevertheless. "As 'a science of power and action', dynamics arises when Leibniz proposes an adequate architectonic of laws for constrained, as well as unconstrained, motions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Duchesneau|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, like Aristotle, this law of nature concerning entelechies was also understood as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical law]], important not only for [[physics]], but also for understanding [[life]] and the [[soul]]. A soul, or spirit, according to Leibniz, can be understood as a type of entelechy (or living [[Monadology|monad]]) which has distinct [[perception]]s and memory.

===Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology===

As discussed above, terms derived from ''dunamis'' and ''energeia'' have become parts of modern scientific vocabulary with a very different meaning from Aristotle's. The original meanings are not used by modern philosophers unless they are commenting on classical or medieval philosophy. In contrast, ''entelecheia'', in the form of "entelechy" is a word used much less in technical senses in recent times.

As mentioned above, the concept had occupied a central position in the metaphysics of Leibniz, and is closely related to his [[Monadology|monad]] in the sense that each sentient entity contains its own entire universe within it. But Leibniz' use of this concept influenced more than just the development of the vocabulary of modern physics. Leibniz was also one of the main inspirations for the important movement in philosophy known as [[German Idealism]], and within this movement and schools influenced by it entelechy may denote a force propelling one to [[self-fulfillment]].

In the biological [[vitalism]] of [[Hans Driesch]], living things develop by ''entelechy'', a common purposive and organising field. Leading vitalists like Driesch argued that many of the basic problems of biology cannot be solved by a philosophy in which the organism is simply considered a machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mayr|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalism and its concepts like entelechy have since been discarded as without value for scientific practice by the overwhelming majority of professional biologists. 

However, in philosophy aspects and applications of the concept of entelechy have been explored by scientifically interested philosophers and philosophically inclined scientists alike. One example was the American critic and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] (1897–1993) whose concept of the "[[terministic screens]]" illustrates his thought on the subject. Most prominent was perhaps the German quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He looked to the notions of potentiality and actuality in order to better understand the relationship of quantum theory to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2106/20160390?Type=ALERT See Jaeger]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''probe tip''' in scanning microscopy literally is a very sharp piece of metal or non-metal, like a sewing needle with a point at one end with nano or sub-nanometer order of dimension. It can interact with up to one molecule or atom of a given surface of a sample that can reveal authentic properties of the surface such as morphology, topography, mapping and electrical properties of a single atom or molecule on the surface of the sample.

The proliferation of the thrust in probe-based tools began after the invention of [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) and [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) (collectively called [[Scanning probe microscopy]]-SPM) by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at the IBM Zurich research laboratory in 1982.&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Binnig |first=G. |last2=Rohrer |first2=H. |last3=Gerber |first3=Ch. |last4=Weibel |first4=E. |date=1982-07-05 |title=Surface Studies by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=57–61 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10033323&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930 |pmid=10033323 |title=Atomic Force Microscope |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=930–933 |year=1986 |last1=Binnig |first1=G |last2=Quate |first2=C.

The significant number of applications for the topographic surface characterization of the materials and biological specimen in various fields of science made researchers and scientists that it is imperative for reproducible mass production of probe tip with sharp apex.

Probe tip size and shape in [[microscopy]] are important parameters providing direct connection between resolution and imaging quality. Resolution and imaging mechanism may depend on geometry (length, width, shape, aspect ratio, and tip apex radius) and composition (material properties) of tip and surface being probed.

Here, we describe fabrication, characterization and application of sharp tips. A wide range of tip fabrication techniques including cutting, grinding, pulling, beam deposition, ion milling, controlled crashing, field emission, field evaporation, fracture and electrochemical etching/polishing are discussed. Both limitations and advantages are also provided for various tip fabrication method. We also describe history and development, working principles, characterization and applications with recent advancement of sharp tips.

The discovery of a sharp probe tip has always been of significant interest among the researchers considering its importance in the material, life and biological sciences for mapping the surface structure and material properties at molecular or atomic dimension. The history of tip can be tracked long back in nineteenth century during the invention of [[Phonautograph]] in 1859. Phonautograph is the predecessor of modern [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. It was invented by Scott and Koenig. It consisted of a parchment diaphragm with an attached stylus (sort of a pen-holder), along with a Hog’s hair, which was used to trace a wavy line on a lamp-blacked surface [Musical mirror by Bryceson, Richard, Jan. 1929-Dec.1930]. In the later development gramophone came out where along with other replacements, the Hog’s hair was replaced by a needle to reproduce sound [Musical mirror by Bryceson, Richard, Jan. 1929-Dec.1930]. In 1940, a pantograph was built utilizing a shielded probe and adjustable tip. A [[stylus]] was free to slide vertically to be in contact with the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1769778 |title=A Scanning Device for Plotting Equipotential Lines |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=12 |pages=37 |year=1941 |last1=Simpson |first1=John A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, a tip was employed in probe circuit to measure peak voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1049/ji-1.1948.0064 |title=The measurement of peak voltage at a frequency of 600 Mc/s by means of a modified probe circuit |journal=Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers - Part I: General |volume=95 |issue=87 |pages=133–134 |year=1948 |last1=Bowdler |first1=G.W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabrication of electrochemically etched sharp tungsten, copper, nickel and molybdenum tip was reported by Muller in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Müller |first=Erwin W. |date=1937-09-01 |title=Elektronenmikroskopische Beobachtungen von Feldkathoden |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |language=de |volume=106 |issue=9–10 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1007/BF01339895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution for sharp tips occurred in producing a good and various kind of tip with different shape, size, aspect ratio composed of tungsten wire, silicon, diamond, [[Carbon nanotube]] etc. occurred with Si-based circuit technologies. This allowed tips for numerous applications in the broad spectrum of nanotechnological fields. Following STM&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982"/&gt; invention came [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM)&lt;ref name=pmid10033323/&gt; by [[Gerd Binnig]], Calvin F. Quate, and Christoph Gerber in 1986. In their instrument they used diamond broken piece as tip sticking it to a hand-cut gold foil [[cantilever]]. Focused ion and electron beam technique for the fabrication of strong, stable, reproducible Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pyramidal tip with 1.0 μm length and 0.1 μm diameter was reported by Russell in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1992-07-01 |title=Microfabrication of AFM tips using focused ion and electron beam techniques |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=42-44 |pages=1526–1532 |doi=10.1016/0304-3991(92)90477-2 |last1=Ximen |first1=Hongyu |last2=Russell |first2=Phillip E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground breaking advancement came through the introduction of microfabrication methods for the fabrication of precised conical or pyramidal silicon and silicon nitride tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1116/1.576520 |title=Microfabrication of cantilever styli for the atomic force microscope |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=3386–3396 |year=1990 |last1=Albrecht |first1=T.

Multifunctional hydrogel nano-probe technique uncovered new scope initiating a completely new concept to the fabrication of tip and their extended ease of applicability to inorganic and biological samples in both air and liquid.

== Tunneling current and force measurement principle ==
The tip itself does not have any working principle for imaging, but depending on the instrumentation, mode of application, and the nature of the sample under investigation, the probe tip may follow different principle to image the surface of the sample. For example, when a tip is integrated with STM, it measures the tunneling current that arises from the interaction between the sample and the tip.&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tersoff &amp; Hamann 1983"/&gt; In AFM, short-ranged force deflection during the raster scan by tip across the surface is measured.&lt;ref name=pmid10033323/&gt; A conductive tip is essential for the STM instrumentation whereas AFM can use conductive&lt;ref name=pmid18654521/&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.117179 |title=Imaging the local electrical properties of metal surfaces by atomic force microscopy with conducting probes |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=69 |issue=13 |pages=1975–1977 |year=1996 |last1=Houzé |first1=F |last2=Meyer |first2=R |last3=Schneegans |first3=O |last4=Boyer |first4=L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-conductive&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=Uwe |last2=Schwarz |first2=Alexander |last3=Wiesendanger |first3=Roland |date=2007-03 |title=Magnetic exchange force microscopy with atomic resolution |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7135 |pages=522–5 |doi=10.1038/nature05617 |pmid=17392782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; prob tip.

=== Conductive probe tip ===
Somewhat, the name implies STM utilizes tunneling charge transfer principle from tip to surface or vice versa thereby recording the current response. This concept originates from particle in a box concept, that is, if potential energy for a particle is small, electron may be found outside of potential well which is a classically forbidden region. This phenomenon is called tunneling.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589494.003.0001 |chapter=Introduction |title=Principles of Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy ''Second'' Edition |pages=1–22 |year=2011 |last1=Wolf |first1=E. L |isbn=9780199589494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expression derived from Schrodinger equation for transmission charge transfer probability is as follow:

&lt;math&gt;T=16\epsilon(1-\epsilon)^{-2k}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{E}{V} = \text{Kinetic energy/potential energy}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{h}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]]

=== Non-conductive probe tip ===
Non-conductive nano-scale tips are widely used for AFM measurements. For non-conducting tip, surface forces acting on the tip/cantilever, are responsible for deflection or attraction of tip.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00651-5 |title=In situ observation of streptavidin-biotin binding on an immunoassay well surface using an atomic force microscope |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=390 |issue=2 |pages=161–164 |year=1996 |last1=Allen |first1=S |last2=Davies |first2=J |last3=Dawkes |first3=A.C |last4=Davies |first4=M.C |last5=Edwards |first5=J.C |last6=Parker |first6=M.C |last7=Roberts |first7=C.J |last8=Sefton |first8=J |last9=Tendler |first9=S.J.B |last10=Williams |first10=P.M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attractive or repulsive forces are used for surface topology, chemical specifications, magnetic and electronic properties.

Grinding a metal wire/rod into a sharp tip was also a method used.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These mechanical procedures usually leave rugged surface with many tiny asperities protruding from the apex which lead to atomic resolution on flat surface. However, irregular shape and large macroscopic radius of curvature result in poor reproducibility and decreased stability especially for probing rough surfaces. Another main disadvantage of making probe by this method is it yields many mini tips which lead to many different signals yielding error in imaging.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Gobind |first=Basnet, |title=Fabrication of Tungsten Tips Suitable for Scanning Probe Microscopy by Electrochemical Etching Methods |date=2013 |publisher=University of Arkansas, Fayetteville |url=http://scholarworks.uark.edu/etd/865/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting, grinding and pulling procedures can only be adapted for metallic tips like W, Ag, Pt, Ir, Pt-Ir and gold. Non-metallic tips cannot be fabricated by these methods.

On other hand a sophisticated mechanical method for tip fabrication is based on hydro-gel method.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This method is based on bottom-up strategy to make probe tips by molecular self-assembly process. First, cantilever is formed in mold by curing pre-polymer solution then it is brought into contact with mold of tip which contains pre-polymer solution. The polymer is cured with ultraviolet light which helps firmly attachment of cantilever with probe. This fabrication method is shown in Fig. 2.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Physio-chemical procedures ===
Physiochemical procedures are fabrication methods of choice these days which yield extremely sharp and symmetric tips with more reproducibility compared to mechanical fabrication-based tips. Among physicochemical method, the electrochemical etching method&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is one of the most popular method. Etching is two or more steps procedure. The “zone electropolishing” is the second step which further sharpens the tip in a very controlled manner. Other physicochemical methods include chemical vapor deposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cheung |first=Chin Li |last2=Hafner |first2=Jason H. |last3=Lieber |first3=Charles M. |date=2000-04-11 |title=Carbon nanotube atomic force microscopy tips: Direct growth by chemical vapor deposition and application to high-resolution imaging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=97 |issue=8 |pages=3809–13 |doi=10.1073/pnas.050498597 |pmid=10737761|pmc=18098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; electron beam deposition onto pre-existing tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=J. |last2=Yuzvinsky |first2=T.

==== Fabrication through etching ====
Electrochemical etching is one of the easiest, inexpensive, most practical, reliable and most widely accepted metallic probe tip fabrication method with desired quality and reproducibility.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Three commonly used electrochemical etching for tungsten tip fabrication are: single lamella drop-off methods,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; double lamella drop-off method&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and submerged method.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1116/1.589029 |title=Preparation of sharp polycrystalline tungsten tips for scanning tunneling microscopy imaging |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures |volume=14 |pages=1 |year=1996 |last1=Zhang |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various cone shape tips can be fabricated by this method by minor changes in the experimental setup. An DC potential between tip and metallic electrode (usually W wire) immersed in solution (Figure 3 a-c). Electrochemical reactions at cathode and anode in basic solutions (2M KOH or 2M NaOH) are usually used.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The overall etching process involved is written here:

Anode;

&lt;chem&gt;W (s) + 8OH- -&gt; WO4 + 4H2O + 6e- (E= 1.05V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Cathode:

&lt;chem&gt;6H2O + 6e- -&gt; 3H2 + 6OH- (E=-2.48V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Overall:

&lt;chem&gt;W (s) + 2OH- -&gt; WO4^2- + 2H2O (l) + 6e- + 3H2 (g) (E= -1.43V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Here, all the potentials are reported vs. SHE.

[[File:Etching drop.png|thumb|Fig. 3: Schematics of fabrication method of probe tip through electrochemical etching method.]]

Schematics of fabrication method of probe tip through electrochemical etching method is shown in Fig. 3.

Experimental setup for Electrochemical etching is shown in Fig. 3a.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Chanwoo |last2=Kim |first2=Sung Tae |last3=Jeong |first3=Byeong Geun |last4=Yun |first4=Seok Joon |last5=Song |first5=Young Jae |last6=Lee |first6=Young Hee |last7=Park |first7=Doo Jae |last8=Jeong |first8=Mun Seok |date=2017-01-13 |title=Tip-Enhanced Raman Scattering Imaging of Two-Dimensional Tungsten Disulfide with Optimized Tip Fabrication Process |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |page=40810 |doi=10.1038/srep40810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different tips fabricated from etching method with different tip radius and angle is illustrated in Fig. 3(b-e).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In electrochemical etching process, W is etched at liquid, solid and air interface (due to surface tension), as shown in Fig. 3. Etching is called static if W wire is kept stationary. Once the tip is etched, lower part falls due to the lower tensile strength than the weight of lower part of wire. The irregular shape is produced by the shifting of meniscus. However, slow etching rate can produce regular tips which controlling current slowly through electrochemical cell. The dynamic etching involves slowly pulling up the wire from solution or sometimes it is moved up and down (oscillating wire) producing smooth tips.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Submerged method ====
In this method a metal wire is vertically etched reducing the diameter from 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm ~ 20&amp;nbsp;nm. Schematic diagram for probe tip fabrication with submerged electrochemical etching method is illustrated in Fig 4. These tips can be used for high quality STM images.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
[[File:Submerged Method.png|thumb|Fig. 4: Schematic diagram for probe tip fabrication with submerged electrochemical etching method (W wire)]]

==== Lamella method ====
In double lamella method the lower part of metal is etched away, and upper part of tip was not etched further.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further etching of the upper part of wire is prevented by covering it with a polymer coating. This method is usually limited to laboratory fabrication.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Double lamella method schematic is shown in Fig. 5.
[[File:Double-Lamella.png|thumb|Fig. 5: A typical double-lamella drop-off electrochemical etching set up]]

=== Single atom tip preparation ===
Transitions metals like Cu, Au and Ag adsorbs single molecules linearly on their surface due to weak van der Waals forces.&lt;ref name=pmid19713523/&gt; This linear projection of single molecule allows interaction of terminal atom of tip with atom of substrate resulting in Pauli repulsion for single molecule or atom mapping studies. Gases deposition on tip is carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) chamber at a low temperature (10K). Deposition of Xe, Kr, NO, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or CO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.4934273 |title=CO tip functionalization in subatomic resolution atomic force microscopy |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=107 |issue=16 |pages=163109 |year=2015 |last1=Kim |first1=Minjung |last2=Chelikowsky |first2=James R }}&lt;/ref&gt; on tip have been successfully prepared and used for imaging studies. However, these tips preparation rely on attachment of single atom or molecule on tip and resulting atomic structure of tip is not known exactly.&lt;ref name=pmid22984067/&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jun |last2=Chen |first2=Pengcheng |last3=Yuan |first3=Bingkai |last4=Ji |first4=Wei |last5=Cheng |first5=Zhihai |last6=Qiu |first6=Xiaohui |date=2013-11-01 |title=Real-Space Identification of Intermolecular Bonding with Atomic Force Microscopy |journal=Science |volume=342 |issue=6158 |pages=611–614 |doi=10.1126/science.1242603 |pmid=24072819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probability of attachment of simple molecule on metals surface is very tedious and required great skills. Therefore, this method is not ubiquitous and not many laws are able to perform these experiments.

=== Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) ===
Sharp tips used in SPM are fragile and prone to damage and wear and tear easily under high working load. Diamond is considered the best option to address this issue.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.118173 |title=Fabrication of small diamond tips for scanning probe microscopy application |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=435–437 |year=1997 |last1=Oesterschulze |first1=E |last2=Scholz |first2=W |last3=Mihalcea |first3=Ch |last4=Albert |first4=D |last5=Sobisch |first5=B |last6=Kulisch |first6=W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond tips for SPM application are fabricated by fracture of bulk diamond, grinding and polishing diamond.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; But, these methods result in considerable loss of diamond. Other strategy to prevent this loss is coating of Silicone tips with thin diamond film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1143265 |title=Diamond force microscope tips fabricated by chemical vapor deposition |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=4053–4055 |year=1992 |last1=Germann |first1=G. J |last2=McClelland |first2=G. M |last3=Mitsuda |first3=Y |last4=Buck |first4=M |last5=Seki |first5=H }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thin films are usually deposited by CVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pssa.2211540113 |title=On the Mechanisms of Bias Enhanced Nucleation of Diamond |journal=Physica Status Solidi A |volume=154 |pages=155–174 |year=1996 |last1=Kulisch |first1=W |last2=Ackermann |first2=L |last3=Sobisch |first3=B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In CVD, diamond is deposited directly on silicon or W cantilever. A schematic diagram for chemical vapor deposition set up is shown in Fig. 6. In this method, flow of methane and hydrogen gas is maintained in such a way that pressure inside chamber is maintained at 40Torr. CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are dissociated at elevated temperature of 2100&amp;nbsp;°C with the help of Ta filament. Nucleation sites are created on the tip of cantilever. Once CVD is complete, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; flow is stopped and chamber is cooled under flow of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Schematics of CVD set up for diamond tip fabrication for AFM application is in Fig. 6.

[[File:Chemical Vapor Deposition.png|thumb|Fig. 6: Schematics of CVD set up for diamond tip fabrication for AFM application]]

=== Reactive ion etching (RIE) fabrication ===
In RIE method, first a grove or structure is made on a substrate followed by deposition of a desired material in that template. Once tip is formed, templating structure is etched off leaving tip and cantilever. A schematic for diamond tip fabrication on silicon wafers through this method has been described in Fig. 7&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Calafiore |first=Giuseppe |last2=Koshelev |first2=Alexander |last3=Darlington |first3=Thomas P. |last4=Borys |first4=Nicholas J. |last5=Melli |first5=Mauro |last6=Polyakov |first6=Aleksandr |last7=Cantarella |first7=Giuseppe |last8=Allen |first8=Frances I. |last9=Lum |first9=Paul |date=2017-05-10 |title=Campanile Near-Field Probes Fabricated by Nanoimprint Lithography on the Facet of an Optical Fiber |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01871-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focused ion beam milling ===
Focused ion beam milling milling is a sharpening method for probe tips in SPM. In this method, first a blunt tip is fabricated by other methods, for example, pyramid mold can be used to fabricate pyramidal tip, CVD method or any other etching method. Then, this tip is sharpened by FIB milling as shown in Fig. 8. The focused ion beam diameter is controlled through a programmable aperture which directly correlates with tip diameter.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
[[File:Fig. 8 Schematics of FIB milling method for probe tip sharpening.png|thumb|Fig 8: Schematics of focused ion beam milling milling method for probe tip sharpening]]

=== Glue ===
This method is used to attach carbon nanotubes on cantilever or blunt tip. A strong adhesive (such as soft acrylic glue) is used to bind CNT with silicon cantilever. CNT are robust, stiff and increase durability of probe tip and can be used for both contact and tapping mode.&lt;ref name="Dai et al 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nguyen |first=Cattien V. |last2=Ye |first2=Qi |last3=Meyyappan |first3=M. |date=2005 |title=Carbon nanotube tips for scanning probe microscopy: fabrication and high aspect ratio nanometrology |journal=Measurement Science and Technology |volume=16 |issue=11 |page=2138 |doi=10.1088/0957-0233/16/11/003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleaning procedures ==
Electrochemically etched tips are usually covered with contaminant on surface which cannot be removed simply by rinsing in water, acetone or ethanol. Some oxides layers on metallic tips, especially on tungsten, need to be removed by post fabrication treatment.

=== Annealing ===
To clean W sharp tips, it is highly desirable to remove contaminant and oxide layer. In this method a tip is heated in UHV chamber at elevated temperature which desorb contaminated layer. Reaction detail is shown below.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(92)91036-B |title=Preparation of STM W tips and characterization by FEM, TEM and SEM |journal=Surface Science |volume=266 |pages=294–298 |year=1992 |last1=Méndez |first1=J |last2=Luna |first2=M |last3=Baró |first3=A.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + W → 3WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↑

WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W (sublimation at &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt;1075K)

As at elevated temperature, trioxides of W are converted to WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which sublimates around 1075K and cleaned metallic W surface left behind. Additional advantage provided by annealing is healing of crystallographic defects produced by fabrication and it also smoothens the tip surface.

=== HF chemical cleaning ===
In HF cleaning method, freshly prepared tip is dipped in 15% concentrated hydrofluoric acid which dissolves oxides of W for 10~30 s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Method of cleaning probe tips of cards and apparatus for implementing the method |date=1996-04-03 |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5814158A/en |accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ion milling ===
In this method, argon ions are directed to the tip surface to remove contaminant layer by sputtering. Tip is either rotated in a flux of argon ions at certain angle in a way that this beam hits on the apex. The bombardment of ions on the tip depletes the contaminants and also results in reduction of radius of tip.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Bombardment time needs to be finely tuned with respect to shape of tip. Sometimes, a short annealing is required after ion milling.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Self-sputtering ===
This method is very similar to ion milling but, in this procedure, UHV chamber is filled with neon at a pressure of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; mbar. When negative voltage is applied on the tip, strong electric field (produced by tip under negative potential) will ionize neon gas and these positively charged ions are accelerated back to tip and causing sputtering at the tip. The sputtering removes contaminants and some atoms from tip which, like ion milling reduces apex radius. By, changing the field strength, one can tune radius of tip to 20&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

== Coating ==
The surface of the Silicon based tips cannot be easily controlled because they usually carry silanol group. Si surface is hydrophilic and can be contaminated easily by environmental. Another disadvantage of Si tips is wear and tear of tip. It is important to coat Si tip to prevent tip deteriorations. The tip coating may also enhance image quality. Following types of coatings are employed for Si tips. First an adhesive layer is pasted (usually chromium layer on 5&amp;nbsp;nm thick titanium) and then gold is deposited by vapor deposition (40-100&amp;nbsp;nm or less). Sometimes, the coating layering reduces tunneling current detection capability of probe tips.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.07.070 |title=C-AFM-based thickness determination of thin and ultra-thin SiO 2 films by use of different conductive-coated probe tips |journal=Applied Surface Science |volume=253 |issue=7 |pages=3615–3626 |year=2007 |last1=Frammelsberger |first1=Werner |last2=Benstetter |first2=Guenther |last3=Kiely |first3=Janice |last4=Stamp |first4=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
The most important aspect of a probe tip is imaging the surfaces efficiently at nanometer. Some concerns involving credibility of the imaging or measurement of sample arises when the shape of tip is not determined accurately. For example, when an unknown tip is used to measure linewidth pattern or other high aspect ratio feature of a surface. There may remain some confusion for the determination of the contribution of tip and the sample in the acquired image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1651638 |title=Metrological large range scanning probe microscope |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=962–969 |year=2004 |last1=Dai |first1=Gaoliang |last2=Pohlenz |first2=Frank |last3=Danzebrink |first3=Hans-Ulrich |last4=Xu |first4=Min |last5=Hasche |first5=Klaus |last6=Wilkening |first6=Guenter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is important to fully and accurately characterize the tips. Probe tips can be characterized for their shape, size, sharpness, bluntness, aspect ratio, radius of curvature, geometry and composition using many advanced instrumental techniques.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1992-07-01 |title=Field emission current-voltage curves as a diagnostic for scanning tunneling microscope tips |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=42-44 |pages=1538–1541 |doi=10.1016/0304-3991(92)90479-4 |last1=Meyer |first1=J.A |last2=Stranick |first2=S.J |last3=Wang |first3=J.B |last4=Weiss |first4=P.S |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA251171&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.98070 |title=Ion milled tips for scanning tunneling microscopy |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=696–698 |year=1987 |last1=Biegelsen |first1=D.

In some cases, optical microscopy cannot provide exact measurements for small tips in nanoscale due to resolution limitation of the optical microscopy.

=== Electron field emission current measurement ===
In electron field emission current measurement method, a high voltage is applied between tip and another electrode followed by measuring field emission current employing Fowler-Nordheim curves &lt;math&gt;[\log_{10}(1/V^2) vs. (1/V)] &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.270.5239.1179 |title=A Carbon Nanotube Field-Emission Electron Source |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5239 |pages=1179–1180 |year=1995 |last1=De Heer |first1=W. A |last2=Ch Telain |first2=A |last3=Ugarte |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large fields-emission current measurements may indicate that the tip is sharp and low field-emission current indicates that the tip is blunt, molten or mechanically damaged. A minimum voltage is essential to facilitate the release of electrons from the surface of tip which in turn indirectly is used to obtain the tip curvature. The downside of this method to the several advantages is that the high electric field required for producing strong electric force that can melt the apex of the tip or might change crystallographic tip nature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy ===
The size and shape of the tip can be obtained by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1143970 |title=Calibration of atomic‐force microscope tips |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1868–1873 |year=1993 |last1=Hutter |first1=Jeffrey L |last2=Bechhoefer |first2=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, TEM images are helpful to detect any layer of insulating materials on the surface of the tip as well as to estimate the size of the layer. These oxides are formed gradually on the surface of tip the right after fabrication due to the oxidation of metallic tip by reacting with the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present in the surrounding atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; SEM has a resolution limitation of below 4&amp;nbsp;nm, TEM may be needed to observe even a single atom theoretically and practically. Tip grain down to 1-3&amp;nbsp;nm or thin polycrystalline oxides or carbon or graphite layers at the tip apex are routinely measured using TEM. The orientation of tip crystal i.e. the angle between the tip plane in the single-crystal and the tip normal can be estimated.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0950-7671/44/12/428 |title=Preparation of contamination-free tungsten specimens for the field-ion microscope |journal=Journal of Scientific Instruments |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=1044–1045 |year=1967 |last1=Fasth |first1=J E |last2=Loberg |first2=B |last3=Nordén |first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical microscopy ===
In the past, optical microscope has been only used to investigate if the tip is bent microscale imaging at many microscales. This is because the resolution limitation of an optical microscope is about 200&amp;nbsp;nm. Imaging software including ImageJ allows determination of the curvature, and aspect ratio of the tip. One drawback of this method is that it renders an image of tip which is a object due to the uncertainty in the nanoscale dimension. This problem can be resolved taking images of tip multiple times followed by putting them together into image by confocal microscope with some fluorescent material coating on the tip. Also, it is a time-consuming process considering the necessity of monitoring the wear or damage or degradation of tip by the collision with the surface during scanning the surface after each scan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1144891 |title=Preparation and characterization of tungsten tips for scanning tunneling microscopy |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1558–1560 |year=1994 |last1=Cricenti |first1=A |last2=Paparazzo |first2=E |last3=Scarselli |first3=M.

=== Scanning tunneling spectroscopy ===
The scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) is spectroscopic form of STM in which spectroscopic data based on curve is obtained to analyze the existence of any oxides or impurities on the tip by monitoring the linearity of the curve which represents metallic tunnel junction.&lt;ref name=Feenstra1994&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(94)90710-2 |title=Scanning tunneling spectroscopy |journal=Surface Science |volume=299-300 |pages=965–979 |year=1994 |last1=Feenstra |first1=Randall M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, cure is non-linear and hence, the tip has a gap like shape around zero bias voltage for oxidized or impure tip whereas the opposite is observed for sharp pure un-oxidized tip.&lt;ref name="Feenstra et al 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(87)90170-1 |title=Tunneling spectroscopy of the Si(111)2 × 1 surface |journal=Surface Science |volume=181 |pages=295–306 |year=1987 |last1=Feenstra |first1=R.M |last2=Stroscio |first2=Joseph A |last3=Fein |first3=A.P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ===
In Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), any oxides present on the tip surface is sputtered out during in-depth analysis with argon ion beam generated by differentially pumped ion pump followed by comparing the sputtering rate of the oxide with experimental sputtering yields.&lt;ref name=Chang1971&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(71)90210-X |title=Auger electron spectroscopy |journal=Surface Science |volume=25 |pages=53–79 |year=1971 |last1=Chang |first1=Chuan C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Auger measurements may estimate the nature of oxides because of the surface contamination and/or composition can be revealed and in some cases thickness of the oxide layer down to 1-3&amp;nbsp;nm can be estimated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also performs similar characterization for the chemical and surface composition by providing information on the binding energy of the surface elements.&lt;ref name=Feenstra1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chang1971/&gt;

Overall, the aforementioned characterization methods of tips can be categorized in three major classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dongmo |first=Samuel |last2=Villarrubia |first2=John S. |last3=Jones |first3=Samuel N. |last4=Renegar |first4=Thomas B. |last5=Postek |first5=Michael T. |last6=Song |first6=Jun-Feng |date=1998-03-01 |title=Tip Characterization for Scanned Probe Microscope Width Metrology |url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/tip-characterization-scanned-probe-microscope-width-metrology |journal=NIST }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

== Applications ==
Probes tips have a wide variety of applications in different fields of science and technology. One of the major areas where probe tips are used is for application in SPM i.e., STM&lt;ref name="Tersoff &amp; Hamann 1983"/&gt; and AFM.&lt;ref name=pmid10649994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Min-Feng |last2=Lourie |first2=Oleg |last3=Dyer |first3=Mark J. |last4=Moloni |first4=Katerina |last5=Kelly |first5=Thomas F. |last6=Ruoff |first6=Rodney S. |date=2000-01-28 |title=Strength and Breaking Mechanism of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Under Tensile Load |journal=Science |volume=287 |issue=5453 |pages=637–640 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.637 |pmid=10649994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, carbon nanotube tips in conjunction with AFM provides an excellent tool for surface characterization in the nanometer realm. CNT tips are also used in tapping-mode Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM), which is a technique where a tip taps a surface by a cantilever driven near resonant frequency of the cantilever. The CNT probe tips fabricated using CVD technique can be used for imaging of biological macromolecules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hafner |first=Jason H. |last2=Cheung |first2=Chin Li |last3=Lieber |first3=Charles M. |date=April 1999 |title=Growth of nanotubes for probe microscopy tips |journal=Nature |volume=398 |issue=6730 |pages=761–762 |doi=10.1038/19658 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2710478/chemistrycheung-17.pdf?sequence=1 |format=Full text }}&lt;/ref&gt; semiconductor&lt;ref name="Nguyen et al 2001"/&gt; and chemical structure.&lt;ref name=pmid19713523/&gt; For example, it is possible to obtain intermittent AFM contact image of IgM macromolecules with excellent resolution using single CNT tip.

[[File:Origin histograma raw data.png|thumb|right|200px|The two columns to the right of the left-most column in this computerized table are raw data.]]
'''Raw data''', also known as '''primary data''', is [[data]] (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. If a scientist sets up a computerized [[thermometer]] which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen is "raw data".  Raw data has not been subjected to processing, "cleaning" by researchers to remove [[outlier]]s, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining [[central tendency]] aspects such as the [[arithmetic mean|average]] or [[median]] result). As well, raw data has not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. It is also referred to as ''primary'' data. Raw data is a relative term (see [[data]]), because even once raw data has been "cleaned" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider this processed data to be "raw data" for another stage of research.  Raw data can be inputted to a [[computer program]] or used in manual procedures such as analyzing [[statistics]] from a [[statistical survey|survey]]. The term "raw data" can refer to the [[Binary number|binary]] data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as "low-level data").

== Generating data ==
Data has two ways of being created or generated. The first is what is called 'captured data',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=United States|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and speedometers serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaustive data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or thrown away.

==Examples==
In [[computing]], raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different areen ([[colloquial]]) formats; [[Code|uncoded]] or unformatted; or some entries might be "suspect" (e.g., [[outlier]]s), requiring [[confirmation]] or [[citation]]. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: "31st January 1999", "31/01/1999", "31/1/99", "31 Jan", or "today". Once captured, this raw data may be [[Data processing|processed]] stored as a normalized format, perhaps a [[Julian date]], to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called "sourcey" data or "eggy" data, the latter a reference to the data being "uncooked", that is, "unprocessed", like a raw [[egg]]) are the data input to processing. A distinction is  made between ''data'' and ''information'', to the effect that information is the ''end'' product of ''data'' processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as "cooked" data in a colloquial sense.{{dubious|date=September 2016}}  Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into "[[information]],"  extraction, organization, analysis and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information.

For example, a [[point-of-sale terminal]] (POS terminal, a computerized [[cash register]]) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a [[software program]] or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a [[calculator]], this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times.  Such ''information'' could then become ''data'' for further processing, for example as part of a predictive [[marketing]] campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a [[database]], which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.  [http://www.w3.org/2009/Talks/0204-ted-tbl/#(34) Inspired] by [http://blog.okfn.org/2007/11/07/give-us-the-data-raw-and-give-it-to-us-now/ a post] by [[Rufus Pollock]] of the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] his call to action is [http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html "Raw Data Now"], meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that "data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it." To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of [[open data]] argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their ''own'' analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the [[unemployment rate]], but a [[poverty]] advocacy group may be able to have its staff [[econometrics|econometricians]] do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">'''Researchsome''' belongs to the -omics set of words, which comprises [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabolomics]] and  related words dealing with scientific research, mostly in the biological sciences and related disciplines, like [[bioinformatics]].

== Origin of term ==
Devised partly as a joke, the term was coined by Ivan Erill, from [[UMBC]], and first used in an oral communication at the 15th Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles (France) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) [http://sites.univ-provence.fr/evol-cgr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=40 "15th EBM PROGRAM"] ''Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles'.' Retrieved December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Erill 2011 EBM Conference Researchsome.png|thumb|The original researchsome slide by Ivan Erill at the 2011 EBM meeting]] As opposed to other -omic words, which originate as [[portmanteau]] from incorrect application of either the -some suffix (derived from the Greek σῶμα (soma, body) as in [[chromosome]] or the -nome suffix (from the Greek νόμος (nomos, "custom" or "law") as in [[economics]]),&lt;ref name="pmid118166670"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yadav SP | title = The wholeness in suffix -omics, -omes, and the word om | journal = J Biomol Tech | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 277 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18166670 | doi = | url = | issn = | pmc=2392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9450566"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuska B | title = Beer, Bethesda, and biology: how "genomics" came into being | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 93 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9450566 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/90.2.93| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jong Bhak (2011) [http://omics.org/index.php/History_of_Omics "History of Omics"] ''The History of Omics: as a generic name for various omics and a standalone biology discipline.' Retrieved December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; researchsome is among the few newly minted words in the biosciences that derives properly from soma and should be read as "body of research". Obviously, the word has a [[double entendre]] interpretation as "some research".

== Application ==
As an entity, the researchsome is meant to be a graphical representation of the body of research conducted by a particular individual or organization. It depicts research fields and their interconnections, much in the same way that graphical renditions of [[interactome]]s outline molecules and their interactions. In its original application, the researchsome was designed to convey a rapid overview of a researcher's areas of expertise onto which the relevant fields for a given lecture or talk could be highlighted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5955">In [[science]], '''priority''' is the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory. Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the '''priority rule''', the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase "[[publish or perish]]", because there are no second prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strevens M|year=2003 |title= The Role of the Priority Rule in Science| journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=55–79| pmid= |pmc= |jstor=3655792}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of [[malaria|malaria transmission]], [[DNA]], [[HIV]], etc.); on the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition, thus, becoming detrimental to scientific progress.&lt;ref name=fang&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fang FC, Casadevall A|year=2012 |title= Reforming science: structural reforms | journal=Infect Immun|volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=897–901 |pmid= 22184420| pmc=3294664|doi= 10.1128/IAI.06184-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority disputes==
Priority becomes a difficult issue usually in the context of priority disputes, where the priority for a given theory, understanding, or discovery comes into question. In most cases historians of science disdain retrospective priority disputes as enterprises which generally lack understanding about the nature of scientific change and usually involve gross misreadings of the past to support the idea of a long-lost priority claim. Historian and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] once remarked that "debates about the priority of ideas are usually among the most misdirected in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1977). ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Feynman]] told [[Freeman Dyson]] that he avoided priority disputes by "Always giv[ing] the bastards more credit than they deserve." Dyson remarked that he also follows this rule, and that this practice is "remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends." &lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, 2011, "The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman, " New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in {{ISBN|9781590178546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The priority rule came into existence before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established. For example, the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the 17th century about priority in the invention of [[calculus]]. This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science.&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors= Fang FC, Casadevall A|title=Intense Competition among Scientists Has Gotten out of Hand|date=25 July 2012| url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand |work= Scientific American |publisher= Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Albert Einstein]], priority questions are often rooted in taking too seriously the myth of the "[[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|lone genius]]" which is often cultivated around such quasi-mythic figures (see [[Great Man theory]] and [[Whig history]]). In an attempt to laud such scientists as visionaries, the context in which they worked is often neglected by popularizers, making it appear as if they worked without assistance or without reference to other work, something which is rarely the case.

[[File:S83-35770.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Norman Thagard]] self-experimenting aboard the [[Space Shuttle]].  He conducted physiological experiments on personnel during the [[STS-7]] mission.]]
'''Self-experimentation''' refers to scientific experimentation in which the experimenter conducts the experiment on her- or himself. Often this means that the designer, operator, subject, analyst, and user or reporter of the experiment are all the same. [[Self-experimentation]] has a long and well-documented history in [[medicine]] which continues to the present. Some of these experiments have been very valuable and shed new and often unexpected insights into different areas of medicine.

There are many motivations for self-experiment. These include the wish to get results quickly and avoid the need for a formal organisational structure, to take the ethical stance of taking the same risk as volunteers, or just a desire to do good for humanity.  Other ethical issues include whether a researcher should self-experiment because another volunteer would not get the same benefit as the researcher will get, and the question of whether informed consent of a volunteer can truly be given by those outside a research program.

A number of distinguished scientists have indulged in self-experimentation, including at least five Nobel laureates; in several cases, the prize was awarded for findings the self-experimentation made possible. Many experiments were dangerous; various people exposed themselves to pathogenic, toxic or radioactive materials. Some self-experimenters, like [[Jesse William Lazear|Jesse Lazear]] and [[Daniel Alcides Carrión]], died in the course of their research. Notable examples of self-researchers occur in many fields; infectious disease ([[Jesse William Lazear|Jesse Lazear]]: [[yellow fever]], [[Max von Pettenkofer]]: [[cholera]]), vaccines (Daniel Zagury: [[AIDS]]), cancer ([[Nicholas Senn]], [[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert]]), blood ([[Karl Landsteiner]], William J. Harrington), and drugs ([[Albert Hofmann]], and too many others to list).  Research has not been limited to disease and drugs.  [[John Stapp]] tested the limits of human deceleration, [[Humphry Davy]] breathed [[nitrous oxide]], and [[Nicholas Senn]] pumped [[hydrogen]] into his gastrointestinal tract to test the utility of the method for diagnosing perforations.

==Definition==
There is no formal definition of what constitutes self-experimentation.  A strict definition might limit it to cases where there is a single-subject experiment and the experimenter performs the procedure on himself.  A looser definition might include cases where the experimenters put themselves amongst the volunteers for the experiment.  According to S. C. Gandevia of the [[University of New South Wales]], who was looking at the question from the perspective of ethics, it is only self-experiment if the would-be self-experimenter would be named as an author on any subsequent published paper.  That is, the person who would receive the academic credit for the experiment must also be the subject of it.&lt;ref name=Gandevia/&gt;{{rp|44}}

==Motivations==
[[File:Herta Oberheuser sentencing.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Herta Oberheuser]] being sentenced at Nuremberg]]
There are many reasons experimenters decide to self-test, but amongst the most fundamental is the ethical principle that the experimenter should not subject the participants in the experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves.  This idea was first codified in the [[Nuremberg Code]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/nurcode.html The Nuremberg Code], U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, accessed and archived, 20 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, which was a result of the [[Doctors' trial|trials of Nazi doctors]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments.  Several of these doctors were hanged.  Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part.  The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}}

Critics of self-experimenters point to other less savoury motivations such as simple self-aggrandisement.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}  Some scientists have resorted to self-experiment to avoid the "red tape" of seeking permission from the relevant [[ethics committee]] of their institution.  [[Werner Forssmann]] was so determined to proceed with his self-experiment that he continued with it even after permission had been denied.  He was twice dismissed for this activity, but the importance of his work was eventually recognised in a [[Nobel Prize]].  Some researchers, apparently, even believe that self-experimentation is not permitted.  However, this is not true, at least in the United States where the same rules apply regardless of who the subject of the experiment is.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xv, xx}}

Self-experimentation is also criticised for the risk of over-enthusiastic researchers, eager to prove a point, not accurately noting the results.  Against this it is argued by those supporting self-experiment that medically trained persons are in a better position to understand and record symptoms, and self-experiment is usually at the very early stage of a program before volunteers have been recruited.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

A wish to commit suicide is sometimes offered as a reason for self-experimentation.  However, Lawrence K. Altman, author of ''Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine'', while acknowledging that this may sometimes occur, after extensive research could find only one verified case of attempted suicide by self-experimentation.  This was Nobel Prize winner [[Élie Metchnikoff]], who, in 1881, suffering from depression, injected himself with [[relapsing fever]].  This was his second suicide attempt, but according to his wife, Olga, he chose this method of death so that it would be of benefit to medicine.  However, Metchnikoff survived and in 1892 also self-experimented with [[cholera]], but this is not thought to have been a suicide attempt.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|311–312}}

Perhaps the noblest motivation is the simple altruistic desire to do something of benefit to humanity regardless of the risks.  There most certainly are risks, as [[Jesse William Lazear|Jesse Lazear]] found to his cost when he died of [[yellow fever]] after deliberately infecting himself.  [[Max von Pettenkofer]], after ingesting cholera bacteria said:{{blockquote|Even if I had deceived myself and the experiment endangered my life, I would have looked Death quietly in the eye for mine would have been no foolish or cowardly suicide; I would have died in the service of science like a soldier on the field of honor.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|25}}|Max von Pettenkofer}}

According to Ian Kerridge, professor of bioethics at the [[University of Sydney]], the most common reason for undertaking self-experimentation is not so much anything noble, but rather "an insatiable scientific curiosity and a need to participate closely in their own research".&lt;ref name=Kerridge/&gt;

==Ethics==
As already mentioned, it is an ethical principle that the researcher should not inflict on volunteers anything that the researcher would not be willing to do to him- or herself, but the researcher is not always a suitable, or even possible, subject for the experiment.  For instance, the researcher may be the wrong gender if the research is into hormone treatment for women, or may be too old, or too young.  The ethical question for the researchers is would they agree to the experiment if they were in the same position as the volunteers?&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|311}}

Another issue that can lead researchers not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from taking part in the experiment.  It is an ethical principle that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting.  Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition.  If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally.  For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an [[AIDS]] vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xx}}  Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have.  Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xiv}}  An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave [[HIV]] [[antibody|antibodies]] in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show [[HIV antibody test|HIV positive when tested]] even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier.  This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with [[life insurance]].&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xix}}

The ethics of [[informed consent]] is relevant to self-experimentation.  Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure that is going to take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand.  The principle of informed consent was first enacted in the [[U.S. Army]]'s research into [[Yellow fever]] in [[Cuba]] in 1901.  However, there was no general or official guidance at this time.&lt;ref name=Gandevia&gt;S. C. Gandevia, "Self-experimentation, ethics, and efficacy", ''Monash Bioethics Review'' (Ethics Committee Supplement), vol. 23, no. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}}  That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|xvi,157}}  This was further developed in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] in 1964 by the [[World Medical Association]] which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines.&lt;ref name=Gandevia/&gt;{{rp|43–44}}
[[File:Rosalyn Yalow.jpg|thumb|Rosalyn Yalow at the Bronx [[VA Hospital]] in 1977]]
Some researchers believe that experimental research is too complex for the general public ever to be able to give proper informed consent.  One such researcher is Eugene G. Laforet, who believes that the researchers taking part in the experiment themselves is more valuable to the volunteers than a legal consent form.  Another is 1977 Nobel Prize winner [[Rosalyn S. Yalow]] who said "In our laboratory we always used ourselves because we are the only ones who can give truly informed consent."&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|313–314}}  On the other side of the coin, there is the possibility that members of a research team may be coerced into participating by peer pressure.&lt;ref name=Gandevia/&gt;{{rp|46}}

The question of who should be first to try the procedure in a new experiment is an ethical one.  However, according to Altman it is not a question that can successfully be legislated.  A law requiring self-test would force researchers to take risks that may sometimes be inappropriate.  A code forbidding it might inhibit valuable discoveries.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|314}}

Self-experimentation has a role in medical education.  Although no longer encouraged, in former times it was perfectly standard to expect medical students to try for themselves the drugs they were going to be prescribing.  [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], whose own self-experiments led him to the concept of what are now called [[hormone]]s, was a nineteenth century proponent of the practice:&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|314–315}}{{blockquote|I will suggest that you should study upon yourselves the effects of the most valuable remedies. I well believe that you will never know fully the action of certain remedies, if you have not ascertained, on your own person, what effects they produce on the brain, the eye, the ear, the nerves, the muscles, and the principal viscera.&lt;ref&gt;Louis-Cyril Celestin, ''Charles-Edouard Brown-Séquard: The Biography of a Tormented Genius'', p. 128, Springer, 2013 {{ISBN|3319030205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard}}

==Value==
Self-experimentation has value in rapidly obtaining the first results.  In some cases, such as with Forssmann's experiments done in defiance of official permission, results may be obtained that would never otherwise have come to light.  However, self-experiment lacks the statistical validity of a larger experiment.  It is not possible to generalise from an experiment on a single person.  For instance, a single successful blood transfusion does not indicate, as we now know from the work of [[Karl Landsteiner]], that all such transfusions between any two random people will also be successful.  Likewise, a single failure does not absolutely prove that a procedure is worthless.  Psychological issues such as [[confirmation bias]] and the [[placebo effect]] are unavoidable in a single-person self-experiment where it is not possible to put [[scientific control]]s in place.&lt;ref name=Kerridge/&gt;

Such concerns do not apply so much if the self-experimenter is just one of many volunteers (as long as the self-experimenter is not also responsible for recording the results) but his or her presence still has value.  As noted above, this can reassure the other participants.  It also acts as a check on the experimenter when considering whether the experiment is ethical or dangerous.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|314}}&lt;ref name=Kerridge/&gt;{{rp|206}}

==Notable examples==

===Anaesthesia===
[[Lidocaine]], the first [[amino]] [[amide]]–type local anaesthetic, was first synthesized under the name ''xylocaine'' by Swedish chemist [[Nils Löfgren]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="lofgren_1948"&gt;{{cite book | author = Löfgren N|title=Studies on local anaesthetics: Xylocaine: a new synthetic drug |type=Inaugural dissertation |publisher=Ivar Heggstroms |location=Stockholm, Sweden |year=1948 |oclc=646046738}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Löfgren N, Lundqvist B | year = 1946 | title = Studies on local anaesthetics II | journal = Svensk Kemisk Tidskrift | volume = 58 | pages = 206–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wildsmith JAW  |year=2011 | title = Lidocaine: A more complex story than 'simple' chemistry suggests | journal = The Proceedings of the History of Anaesthesia Society | url = http://www.histansoc.org.uk/uploads/9/5/5/2/9552670/vol_43.pdf | volume = 43 | pages = 9–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anaesthesia experiments on himself.&lt;ref name="lofgren_1948" /&gt;

===Asthma===
[[Roger Altounyan]] developed the use of [[sodium cromoglycate]] as a remedy for [[asthma]], based on [[khella]], a traditional Middle Eastern remedy, with experiments on himself.

=== Blood ===

==== ABO blood group system ====
[[File:Karlas Landsteiner 1930.jpg|thumb|Karl Landsteiner in his laboratory]]
Dr. [[Karl Landsteiner]]'s discovery of the [[ABO blood group system]] in 1900 was based on an analysis of blood samples from six members of his laboratory staff, including himself.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|34–37}}

====Thrombocytopenia====
In the [[Harrington–Hollingsworth experiment]] in 1950, William J. Harrington performed an exchange blood transfusion between himself and a thrombocytopenic patient, discovering the immune basis of [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] and providing evidence for the existence of [[autoimmunity]].

===Cancer===
In 1901, [[Nicholas Senn]] investigated whether cancer was contagious.  He surgically inserted under his skin a piece of cancerous [[lymph node]] from a patient with cancer of the lip.  After two weeks, the transplant started to fade and Senn concluded that cancer is not contagious.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|287}}&lt;ref name="Fiks"&gt;Arsen P. Fiks, Paul A. Buelow, ''Self-experimenters: Sources for Study'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 {{ISBN|0313323488}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203}}

Much earlier, in 1808, [[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert]] injected himself with a discharge from [[breast cancer]].  The site of injection became inflamed, but did not develop cancer.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|286–287}}&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

[[Gerhard Domagk]], in 1949, injected himself with sterilised extract of human cancer in an attempt to prove that [[immunisation]] against cancer was possible.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|287–288}}

=== Infectious diseases and vaccines ===

==== AIDS vaccine ====
Daniel Zagury, in 1986, was the first to test his proposed AIDS vaccine.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zagury, Régine Léonard, Michéle Fouchard, Brigitte Réveil, Jacky Bernard, Daniéle Ittelé, Albert Cattan, Lurhuma Zirimwabagabo, Mbayo Kalumbu, Wane Justin, Jean-Jacques Salaun &amp; Bernard Goussard, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6110/abs/326249a0.html "Immunization against AIDS in humans"], ''Nature'', vol. 326, pp. 249–250, 25 March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zagury, Jacky Bernard, Remi Cheynier, Isabelle Desportes, Regine Leonard, Michelle Fouchard, Brigitte Reveil, Daniele Ittele, Zirimwabagangabo Lurhuma, Kalumbu Mbayo, Justin Wane, Jean-Jacques Salaun, Bernard Goussard, Loic Dechazal, Arsene Burny, Peter Nara &amp; Robert C Gallo, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v332/n6166/abs/332728a0.html "A group specific anamnestic immune reaction against HIV-1 induced by a candidate vaccine against AIDS"], ''Nature'', vol. 332, pp. 728–731, 21 April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bartonellosis ====
[[Daniel Alcides Carrión]], in 1885, infected himself from the pus in the purple wart ([[verruga peruana]]) of a female patient.  Carrión developed an acute form of [[bartonellosis]] now known as [[Carrion's disease]] or Oroya fever.  This is a rare disease found only in Peru and certain other parts of South America.  He kept detailed notes of his condition and succeeded in showing through this self-experiment that the chronic and acute forms were the same disease.  He died from the disease after several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Ciro Maguiña, Eloy E. Ordaya, "Bartonellosis: Carrion's disease and other ''Bartonella'' infections", p. 564, in, Alan J. Magill, Edward T. Ryan, David R. Hill, Tom Solomon, ''Hunter's Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases'', Elsevier, 2013 {{ISBN|141604390X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A student who had assisted Carrion in carrying out this work was arrested and charged with murder, but later released.&lt;ref&gt;''Cutis'', vol. 48, iss. 4–6, p. 339, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cholera ====
[[File:Max von Pettenkofer bse.jpg|thumb|upright|Max von Pettenkofer]]
[[Max von Pettenkofer]], in October 1892, drank [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillon]] deliberately infected with a large dose of [[cholera]] bacteria.  Pettenkofer was attempting to disprove the theory of [[Robert Koch]] that the disease was caused by the bacteria ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' alone.  Pettenkofer also took [[bicarbonate of soda]] to counter a claim by Koch that stomach acid killed the bacteria.  Pettenkofer escaped with mild symptoms and claimed success, but the modern view is that he did indeed have cholera, luckily just a mild case, and possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|24–26}}

==== Dysentry ====
S.O. Levinson with H.J. Shaugnessy – and others between 1942 and 1947 – injected themselves with a vaccine against [[dysentry]].  The vaccine had previously been tested on mice, which had all died within minutes, and the effect on humans was completely unknown.  The experimenters survived but suffered strong side effects.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|139}}

==== Gastritis and peptic ulcers ====

===== ''Helicobacter pylori'' =====
In 1984 a Western Australian scientist, Dr [[Barry Marshall]], discovered the link between ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (at that time known as ''Campylobacter pylori'') and [[gastritis]]. This was based on a series of self-experiments that involved [[gastroscopy]] and [[biopsy]], ingestion of ''H. pylori'', regastroscopy and biopsy and subsequent treatment with [[tinidazole]]. His only option was self-experimentation: ethical measures forbade him from administering ''H. pylori'' to any other person. In 2005, Marshall and his long-time collaborator [[Robin Warren]] were awarded [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], "for their discovery of the bacterium ''Helicobacter pylori'' and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease".

Marshall's experiment debunked the long-held belief of the medical profession that [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] was the cause of gastritis.  This cleared the way for the development of [[antibiotic]] treatments for gastritis and [[peptic ulcer]]s and a new line of research into the likely role of ''H. pylori'' in [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;Lawrence K. Altman, ''Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine'', University of California Press, 1987 {{ISBN|0520212819}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x}}

===== ''Campylobacter jejuni'' =====
Marshall's investigation was preceded by David A. Robinson who, in 1980, ingested ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]],'' a bacterium found in cow's milk, to investigate whether gastritis could be caused by drinking milk infected with ''C. jejuni.''  Robinson became sick as a result.  Robinson needed to do a human experiment because the alternative, testing on cows, was not viable as infected cows frequently do not become ill.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{Rp|33}}

====''Staphylococcus''====
[[Gail Monroe Dack]] (1901–1976), a former president of the [[American Society for Microbiology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asm.org/index.php/71-membership/archives/837-general-meetings "List of ASM (formerly SAB) general meetings 1899–present"], American Society for Microbiology, accessed and archived, 18 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; gave himself [[food poisoning]] by eating cake tainted with ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|56–57}}

====Syphilis====
[[Constantin Levaditi]] (1874–1953) injected himself with [[spirochaete]] from rabbits suffering from [[syphilis]] but did not contract the disease himself.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|138–139}}

====Yellow fever====
[[File:Lazear Jesse William 1866-1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Jesse Lazear]]
In [[Cuba]], U.S. Army doctors from [[Walter Reed]]'s research team infected themselves with [[yellow fever]] including [[James Carroll (scientist)|
James Carroll]], [[Aristides Agramonte]], and, most notably, [[Jesse William Lazear|Jesse Lazear]], who died from yellow fever complications in 1900. These efforts ultimately resulted in proof of the [[mosquito]]-borne nature of yellow fever transmission and saved countless lives. [[Stubbins Ffirth]] had investigated the contagious nature of the disease at the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

There was an unsuccessful campaign to award a Nobel Prize to Reed's team.  Lazear, in any event, could not be awarded the prize because it is never given posthumously. However, a Nobel Prize was awarded to a later yellow fever researcher and self-experimenter, [[Max Theiler]] who, in 1951, developed the first yellow fever vaccine and was the first to try it.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|156–157}}

====Trachoma====
Anatolii Al'bertovich Shatkin, in 1961, injected [[trachoma]] virus into the [[conjunctival]] sac of his eye and rapidly developed trachoma.  He did not begin treatment of the condition for 26 days.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|205}}

====Schistosomiasis====

In July 1944, physician researcher Claude Barlow ingested over 200 [[Schistosomiasis|schistosome]] worms to carry back to the United States from Egypt to study whether domestic snails could become infected and introduce the disease into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farley |first1=John |title=Bilharzia: A History of Imperial Tropical Medicine |date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-40086-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to send infected snails, the intermediate host, by mail had been unsuccessful. He refused treatment, despite being desperately ill by December, so as not to lose the eggs for further study. He finally passed 4,630 eggs in his semen and 200 eggs in  his urine. The U.S. government decided not to use the eggs, so his self-sacrifice was to no avail. It was November 1945 before he finally cleared all the parasites, after treatment with [[tartar emetic]].

=== Diseases: non-infectious ===

==== Anaemia ====
[[William Bosworth Castle]], in 1926, ate minced raw beef every morning, regurgitated it an hour later, and then fed it to his patients suffering from [[pernicious anaemia]].&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|258–263}}  Castle was testing his theory that there was an [[intrinsic factor]] produced in a normal stomach that hugely increased the uptake of the extrinsic factor (now identified as [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]), lack of which leads to pernicious anaemia.  Beef is a good source of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, but patients did not respond with beef alone.  Castle reasoned they lacked production of intrinsic factor and he could provide it from his own stomach.  While Castle was not the recipient of this treatment, his story is included in ''Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine'' and is considered a self-experimenter by the author.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|258–263}}&lt;ref&gt;Marshall A. Lichtman, Jerry L. Spivak, ''Hematology: Landmark Papers of the Twentieth Century'', p. 564, Academic Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0124485103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. J.

====Hyperthyroidism====
[[Elliott Cutler]] (1888–1947) took sufficient [[thyroid extract]] to give himself [[hyperthyroidism]] and enable him to study the effect of the condition on [[kidney]] function.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

=== Drugs ===

====Cocaine====
In 1936, Edwin Katskee took a very large dose of [[cocaine]].  He attempted to write notes on his office wall, but these became increasingly illegible as the experiment proceeded.  Katskee was found dead the next morning.&lt;ref name=Boese/&gt;{{rp|313–325}}

==== Disulfiram ====
In 1945, during the [[German occupation of Denmark]], Erik Jacobsen and Jens Hald at the Danish drug company Medicinalco (which had a group of enthusiastic self-experimenters that called itself the "Death Batallion") were exploring the possible use of [[disulfiram]] to treat intestinal parasites, and in the course of testing it on themselves, accidentally discovered its effects when alcohol is ingested, which led several years later to the drug called Antabuse.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|98–105}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=From Disulfiram to Antabuse: The Invention of a Drug |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2008 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=82–88 |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p82-88.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hald |first1=Jens |last2=Jacobsen |first2=Erik |last3=Larsen |first3=Valdemar |title=The Sensitizing Effect of Tetraethylthiuramdisulphide (Antabuse) to Ethylalcohol. |journal=Acta Pharmacologica et Toxicologica |date=July 1948 |volume=4 |issue=3-4 |pages=285–296 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1948.tb03350.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furan====
[[Chauncey D. Leake]], in 1930, took [[furan]] as a possible substitute for [[aspirin]] but it just gave him a splitting headache and painful urination that lasted three days.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|137–138}}

====Grapefruit juice====
David G. Bailey, in 1989, was researching the effects of drinking alcohol while taking the then experimental drug [[felodipine]].  It was usual in this kind of research to [[Screwdriver (cocktail)|mix the alcohol with orange juice]] but Bailey did not like the taste of this drink so used [[grapefruit juice]] instead.  Bailey found that there was three times more felodipine in his, and fellow researchers', blood than had been reported by other scientists using orange juice.  It was later found that grapefruit juice suppresses an [[enzyme]] responsible for breaking down a large number of different drugs.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;{{rp|x-xi}}&lt;ref&gt;David G Bailey, J Malcolm, O Arnold, J David Spence, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1873672/ "Grapefruit juice–drug interactions"], ''British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology'', vol. 46, iss. 2, pp. 101–110, August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibuprofen====
As part of the team who developed [[ibuprofen]] in the 1960s, Stewart Adams initially tested it on a hangover.

====Psychoactive drugs====
{{See also|Psychonautics}}
[[Friedrich Sertürner]] isolated [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1804. Morphine was the first-ever [[alkaloid]] isolated from any plant. Sertürner wanted to prove his findings to his colleague with a public experiment on himself and three other friends.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/gallery/psychonauts/7 The high life of the self-experimenters] New Scientist 12 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] published his study "Du Hachisch et de l'aliénation mentale" in 1845. He self-experimented with [[hashish]] and observed its varying effects on other people. Moreau insisted that researchers should self-experiment to gain understanding of the [[altered states of consciousness]] produced by [[psychoactive substance]]s.

Psychopharmacologist [[Arthur Heffter]] isolated [[mescaline]] from the [[peyote]] cactus in 1897 and conducted experiments on its effects by comparing the effects of peyote and mescaline on himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.heffter.org/about-arthurheffter2.htm |title=Excerpt from Arthur Heffters 1897 laboratory notebook detailing the discovery that mescaline was the centrally active compound found in the peyote cactus |publisher=Heffter.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030120540/http://www.heffter.org/about-arthurheffter2.htm |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Hofmann]] [[History of LSD#Discovery|discovered the psychedelic properties of LSD]] in 1943 by accidentally absorbing it and later intentionally ingesting it to verify that the effects were caused by LSD. He was also the first to isolate [[psilocybin]] from [[psilocybin mushroom]]s and self-experimented with it to prove it to be the active principle of psilocybin mushroom's psychoactive effects.

Psychopharmacologist [[Alexander Shulgin]] synthesized and experimented with a wide array of new phenethylamine and tryptamine drugs, discovering a range of previously unknown psychoactive drug effects.

[[Timothy Leary]] took [[LSD]] and was a well-known proponent of the social use of the drug in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|138}}

=== Gases ===

====Hydrogen====
[[File:Nicholas Senn 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicholas Senn]]
Around 1886, [[Nicholas Senn]] pumped nearly six litres of [[hydrogen]] through his [[anus]].&lt;ref name=Pilcher/&gt;  Senn used a rubber balloon holding four [[US gallon]]s connected to a rubber tube inserted in the anus.  An assistant sealed the tube by squeezing the anus against it.  The hydrogen was inserted by squeezing the balloon while monitoring the pressure on a [[manometer]].  Senn had previously carried out this experiment on dogs to the point of rupturing the intestine.&lt;ref name=Pilcher&gt;James E. Pilcher, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430651/ "Senn on the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal perforation by the rectal insuffation of hydrogen"], ''Annals of Surgery'', vol. 8, iss. 3, pp. 190–204, September 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;  Senn was a pioneer of using this technique to determine if the bullet in gunshot wounds had penetrated the [[intestinal tract]].  In experiments on gunshot wounds to dogs, Senn verified that the gas escaping from the wound was hydrogen by setting light to it.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Senn, [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=436974 "Rectal insufflation of hydrogen gas: an infallible test in the diagnosis of visceral injury of the gastro-intestinal canal in penetrating wounds of the abdomen"], ''The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 10, no. 25, pp. 767–777, June 23, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports that Senn used helium in this experiment&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|203}} are almost certainly erroneous.  Helium was first detected on Earth in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Walter Stewart, ''Recent Advances in Physical and Inorganic Chemistry'', p. 201, BiblioBazaar, 2008 {{ISBN|0-554-80513-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not isolated until 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Clifford A. Hampel, ''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', Van Nostrand Reinhold, pp. 256–268, 1968 {{ISBN|0-442-15598-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and extractable reserves not found until 1903.&lt;ref&gt;John Emsley, ''Nature's Building Blocks'', pp. 175–179, Oxford University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-850341-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Synthetic gases====
[[Humphry Davy]] self-experimented with breathing of several different gases, most notably [[nitrous oxide]].

=== Genes ===
{{Further information|Gene therapy|Gene doping}}
Self-experimentation with [[gene therapy|gene therapies]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0218-119 FDA warns public of dangers of DIY gene therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29406512 FDA warns public of dangers of DIY gene therapy.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/02/19/video-biohacker-documents-diy-gene-therapy/ Video: Biohacker documents his own DIY gene therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="My body, my genes"&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407917322571 My body, my genes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm586343.htm Information About Self-Administration of Gene Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Every gene therapy has a unique risk of harm, including the risk associated with the [[gene delivery]] method (i.e., the particular [[viral vector]] or form of [[transfection]]) that is used and the risk associated with a specific genetic modification.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} Examples of potential risks for some gene therapies include tissue damage and an immune response to foreign DNA,&lt;ref name="My body, my genes"/&gt; among many others.

=== Pain ===
[[Thomas Lewis (cardiologist)|Thomas Lewis]] and [[Jonas Kellgren]] studied [[pain]] in the 1930s.  To do this, they injected [[hypertonic saline]] into various parts of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=Gandevia/&gt;{{rp|45}}

=== Physical experiments ===

====Hanging====
In the early 1900s [[Nicolae Minovici]], a professor of [[forensic science]] in [[Bucharest]], undertook a series of experiments into [[hanging]].  At first he put the noose around his neck while lying down and had an assistant put tension on the rope.  He then moved on to full suspension by the neck.  Finally, he attempted suspension with a slipping hangman's knot, but the pain was too great for him to continue.  He could not swallow for a month.  Minovici was determined to surpass a record set by Dr. Fleichmann of [[Erlangen]], who in 1832, self-asphyxiated for two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Fleichmann, tr. L. Paris, [http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/?cote=90141x1832x08&amp;p=416&amp;do=page "Des différents genres de mort"], ''Annales d'Hygiène Publique et de Médecine Légale'', series 1, vol. 8, pp. 412–437, 1832. {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Minovici could not get close to this and disbelieved Fleichmann.&lt;ref name=Boese&gt;Alex Boese, ''Electrified Sheep'', Pan Macmillan, 2011 {{ISBN|9781447212188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318–320}}

Minovici and Fleichmann are not the only ones to self-experiment with strangulation.  [[Graeme Hammond]], a doctor in New York, tried it in 1882.  [[Francis Bacon]] described an even earlier occasion in 1623 when the self-experimenter stepped off a stool with a rope around his neck, but was unable to regain his footing on the stool without assistance.&lt;ref name=Boese/&gt;{{rp|316–317}}

====Rapid acceleration====
[[File:Stapp hits the brakes, hard.gif|thumb|Stapp being brought to a sudden stop in the rocket sled]]
[[John Paul Stapp]], in 1954, sat in a rocket sled fired along rails in a series of steadily more violent tests.  Speeds reached 631&amp;nbsp;mph, almost the speed of sound.  This is a speed record for a manned rail vehicle that still stands today.  At the end of the track the sled hit a trough of water&lt;ref&gt;Sheryl L. Hutchison, ''Mentor Inbound: The Authorized Biography of Fred J. Ascani, Major General, Usaf Retired'', p. 101, AuthorHouse, 2009 {{ISBN|1438999739}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that brought it to a rapid stop in around 1.4 seconds.  In the most severe test, Stapp underwent an acceleration of 20 [[g-force|g]] as the rocket engine accelerated the vehicle up to speed and 46 g of deceleration (also a record) as the vehicle was brought to a stop.  Stapp suffered numerous injuries in these tests (previous animal tests had shown that limbs could be broken merely by being pulled into the air stream), and several concussions.  In the last test his eyes were bloodied as blood vessels burst in his eyes.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;James D. Livingston, ''Rising Force'', p. 184, Harvard University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|0674055357}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Bibel, ''Beyond the Black Box: The Forensics of Airplane Crashes'', JHU Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0801886317}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352–355}}

These tests were carried out for the [[US Air Force]] to determine the forces that pilots could be subjected to and to enable better restraining straps to be designed.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;

====Weight balance====
[[Santorio Santorio]] spent a large portion of 30 years living on a platform meticulously measuring his daily weight combined with that of his intake and [[excretion]] in an effort to test [[Galen|Galen's]] theory that respiration occurs through the skin as ''perspiratio insensibilis'' (insensible [[perspiration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-researchers-who-experimented-on-themselves.php|title=Top 10 Researchers who Experimented on Themselves|work=Toptenz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the 1614 publication ''[[De Statica Medicina]]'' ("On Medical Measurements").&lt;ref name="santorio"&gt;Eknoyan G.

=== Poisons ===

====Black widow spider venom====
[[Allan Blair]] of the [[University of Alabama]], in 1933, deliberately caused a [[black widow spider]] to bite him.  At the time there was some doubt that the reported symptoms of some victims were the result of a spider bite or some other cause.  Blair's experiment was intended to settle the matter.  Blair became seriously ill and was hospitalised for several days in great pain, but survived.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Grice, "Black widow", ''The Red Hourglass: Lives of the Predator'', Random House Publishing Group, 2009 {{ISBN|0307568148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrogen cyanide====
[[File:Sir Joseph Barcroft Wellcome L0012345.jpg|thumb|upright|Joseph Barcroft]]
[[Joseph Barcroft]], in 1917, tested [[hydrogen cyanide]] on himself as part of research into [[poison gas in World War I]].   He was shut in a chamber with a dog and exposed to the gas.  Barcroft continued with the experiment even after the dog went into [[tetanic convulsion]]s and appeared to die.  The experiment was continued for less than two minutes.  The next morning the dog was found to be alive and apparently fully recovered.  It is not known why dogs are more susceptible to the gas than humans.&lt;ref name=West&gt;John B.

====Snake venom====
Tim Friede created his own vaccine against snakebite using pure venom injections from all four species of mambas, and four cobra species to achieve high immunity. He also survived IgE shock six times with mamba injections. Others have also injected venom to create immunity to snake venom: [[Bill Haast]], Harold Mierkey, Ray Hunter, Joel La Rocque, Herschel Flowers, Martin Crimmins, and Charles Tanner.&lt;ref&gt;Kagen, S. and Muthiah, R.

====Tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride====
In 1921, Maurice Crowther Hall ingested [[carbon tetrachloride]] to test its safety with a view to its possible use as a treatment for [[hookworm]].  Hall reported mild side effects.  Carbon tetrachloride has since been found to cause [[acute liver failure]].&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Cameron, W. A. E. Karunaratne, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/path.1700420104/abstract "Carbon tetrachloride cirrhosis in relation to liver regeneration"], ''The Journal of Pathology'', vol. 42, iss. 1, pp. 1–21, January 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, Hall ingested [[tetrachloroethylene]] (once the most common [[dry cleaning]] fluid) for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|102}}

===Radioactive materials and isotopes===
Gary Earl Leinbach, in 1972, swallowed [[radioactive iodine]] and a knife in a tube for a [[biopsy]].  Leinbach was investigating a new way of diagnosing [[steatorrhea]].&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|138}}

Kenneth Gordon Scott, in 1949, inhaled aerosols of [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Fiks" /&gt;{{rp|203}}

=== Surgical and psychological procedures ===

====Cardiac catheterization====
[[File:Werner Forssmann nobel.jpg|thumb|upright|Werner Forssmann]]
Clinical application of [[cardiac catheterization]] began with [[Werner Forssmann]] in the 1930s, who inserted a catheter into the [[brachial vein]] of his own forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an [[X-ray]] picture of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fontenot C, O'Leary J | title = Dr. Werner Forssmann's self-experimentation. | journal = Am Surg | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 514–5 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8651541}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forssmann did this procedure without permission.  He obtained the assistance of a nurse by deceiving her that she was to be the subject of the experiment.  He tied down her arms while inserting the catheter into his own arm, only releasing her at the point it was too late to change, and he needed her assistance.&lt;ref name=Kerridge&gt;I. Kerridge, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1445-5994.2003.00337.x/abstract "Altruism or reckless curiosity? A brief history of self experimentation in medicine"], ''Internal Medical Journal'', vol. 24, iss. 2, pp. 43–48, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Forssmann was twice fired for carrying out these self-experiments, but shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1956 for this achievement.  Cardiac catheterization is now a routine procedure in heart surgery.&lt;ref name=Altman/&gt;{{rp|51}}

====Self-surgery====
{{main|Self-surgery}}
There have been several cases of surgeons operating on themselves, but most often it has been in the nature of an emergency rather than experiment.  Such a case was [[Leonid Rogozov]] who was obliged to remove his own [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] in 1961 while stranded in Antarctica in winter.&lt;ref&gt;L.I. Rogozov, [http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/rogozov-1964.pdf "Self-operation"], ''Soviet Antarctic Expedition Information Bulletin'', pp. 223–224, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the first surgeon to carry out this self-operation, [[Evan O'Neill Kane]] in 1921, did so with an element of experiment.  Although Kane's operation was necessary, it was not necessary to do it himself, so that in itself was experimental.  More than that, Kane wished to experience the operation under [[local anaesthetic]] before trying the procedure on his patients.  Kane advocated a reduction in the use of [[general anaesthetic]] by surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frederic|last=Damrau|work=Popular Science Monthly |date=February 1933|title= Safe pain killing drugs bring new era in surgery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 |pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70917F8395810738DDDAF0994DA405B818EF1D3 |work=New York Times |date=February 16, 1921|title=Pennsylvania surgeon operates on himself}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sensory deprivation====
[[John C. Lilly]] developed the first [[Isolation tank|sensory deprivation tanks]] and self-experimented them with the intention to study the origin of consciousness and its relation to the brain by creating an environment which isolates an individual from external stimulation.

====Temperature and pressure====
[[Joseph Barcroft]], in 1920, spent six days in a sealed glass chamber to investigate respiration at altitude.  The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen was initially 163 mmHg falling to 84 mmHg (equivalent to an altitude of 18,000&amp;nbsp;ft) as the experiment progressed.  Barcroft was attempting to disprove a theory of [[John Scott Haldane]] that the lungs actively secrete oxygen into the blood (rather than just through the process of passive [[diffusion]]) under conditions of low oxygen partial pressure.  Barcroft suffered from severe [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  At the end of experiment, part of Barcroft's left [[radial artery]] was removed for investigation.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;{{rp|274–279}}

In 1931, Barcroft subjected himself to freezing temperatures while naked.  Towards the end of the experiment he showed signs of the final stages of [[hypothermia]].  He was thought to be close to death and had to be rescued by colleagues.&lt;ref name=Boese/&gt;{{rp|321–322}}

====Neural implant====
[[Kevin Warwick]] had an array of 100 electrodes fired into the [[median nerve]] fibres of his left arm. With this in place, over a 3-month period, he conducted a number of experiments linking his nervous system with the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems", ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structuralism'''{{Cref|α}} (also known as '''scientific structuralism'''&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Bokulich, Peter Bokulich (eds.), ''Scientific Structuralism'', Springer, 2011, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; or as the '''structuralistic theory-concept''')&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Balzer, C. Ulises Moulines (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books/about/Structuralist_Theory_of_Science.html?id=nj2selIJ-isC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Structuralist Theory of Science: Focal Issues, New Results''], Walter de Gruyter, 1996, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; is an active research program in the [[philosophy of science]], which was first developed in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s by several [[analytic philosophers]].

==Overview==
Structuralism asserts that all aspects of reality are best understood in terms of empirical scientific constructs of entities and their relations, rather than in terms of concrete entities in themselves.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Structural Realism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the concept of matter should be interpreted not as an absolute property of nature in itself, but instead of how scientifically-grounded mathematical relations describe how the concept of matter interacts with other properties, whether that be in a broad sense such as the gravitational fields that mass produces or more empirically as how matter interacts with sense systems of the body to produce sensations such as weight.&lt;ref name="Kuhlmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhlmann|first=Meinard|title=What is Real?|journal=Scientific American|date=August 2013|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to comprise all important aspects of an empirical theory in one formal framework. The proponents of this meta-theoretic theory are [[Bas van Fraassen]], [[Frederick Suppe]], [[Patrick Suppes]], [[Ronald Giere]],&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Bokulich, Peter Bokulich (eds.), ''Scientific Structuralism'', Springer, p. 140 n. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; [[Joseph D. Sneed]], [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]], [[Carlos Ulises Moulines]], [[Wolfgang Balzer]], [[John Worrall (philosopher)|John Worrall]], [[Elie Georges Zahar]], [[Pablo Lorenzano]], [[Otávio Bueno]], [[Anjan Chakravartty]], [[Tian Yu Cao]], [[Steve French (philosopher)|Steven French]], and [[Michael Redhead]].

The term "structural realism" for the variation of [[scientific realism]] motivated by structuralist arguments, was coined by American philosopher {{Interlanguage link multi|Grover Maxwell|es}} in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, G. (1968), "Scientific Methodology and the Causal Theory of Perception", in: [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Alan Musgrave]] (eds.), ''Problems in the Philosophy of Science'', Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the British structural realist philosopher [[James Ladyman]] distinguished [[#Epistemic structural realism|epistemic]] and [[#Ontic structural realism|ontic]] forms of structural realism.&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, J., 1998. "What is structural realism?" ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', 29: 409–424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

==Variations==
===Epistemic structural realism&lt;!--'Epistemic structural realism', 'No-miracles argument' and 'No miracles argument' redirect here--&gt;===
The philosophical concept of (scientific) structuralism is related to that of '''[[epistemic]] structural realism''' ('''ESR''').&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; ESR, a position originally and independently held by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1902),&lt;ref&gt;Henri Poincaré, ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]''. New York: Dover, 1952 [1902].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Poincaré's structuralism was combined with [[neo-Kantian]] views about the nature of [[arithmetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] (1927),&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1927). ''The Analysis of Matter'', London: George Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Carnap]] (1928),&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap (1928). ''The Logical Structure of the World'', Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was resurrected by [[John Worrall (philosopher)|John Worrall]] (1989), who proposes that there is retention of structure across [[theory change]]. Worrall, for example, argued that [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel's equations]] imply that light has a structure and that [[Maxwell's equations]], which replaced Fresnel's, do also; both characterize light as vibrations. Fresnel postulated that the vibrations were in a mechanical medium called "[[Luminiferous aether|ether]]"; Maxwell postulated that the vibrations were of electric and magnetic fields.  The structure in both cases is the vibrations and it was retained when Maxwell's theories replaced Fresnel's.&lt;ref&gt;J. Worrall (1989). "Structural realism: The best of both worlds?" ''Dialectica'', 43: p. 119; [http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/Institute/Philosophie/Theoretische_Philosophie/Fahrbach/Wissenschaftlicher_Realismus/Worrall%201989%20Structural%20Realism%20.pdf available online].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because structure is retained, structural realism both (a) avoids [[pessimistic meta-induction]]{{Cref|β}} and (b) does not make the success of science seem miraculous, i.e., it puts forward a '''no-miracles argument'''.&lt;ref&gt;The term is due to [[Hilary Putnam]] (see Putnam, H., 1975. ''Mathematics, Matter and Method'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 73).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newman problem&lt;!--'Newman objection', 'Newman problem', 'Newman's objection', and 'Newman's problem' redirect here--&gt;====
The so-called '''Newman problem''' (also '''Newman's problem''', '''Newman objection''',  '''Newman's objection''') refers to the critical notice of Russell's ''The Analysis of Matter'' (1927) published by [[Max Newman]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. A. Newman, 1928. "Mr. Russell's causal theory of perception," ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', 37: 137–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Newman argued that the ESR claim that one can know only the abstract structure of the external world trivializes scientific knowledge. The basis of his argument is the realization that "[a]ny collection of things can be organized so as to have structure ''W'', provided there are the right
number of them", where ''W'' is an arbitrary structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Frigg]] and Ioannis Votsis (2011), "Everything you always wanted to know about structural realism but were afraid to ask," ''European Journal for Philosophy of Science'' '''1'''(2):227–276, esp. p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to the Newman problem&lt;!--'Ramsey-style epistemic structural realism' and 'Russellian epistemic structural realism' redirect here--&gt;====
John Worrall (2000) advocates a version of ESR augmented by the [[Ramsey sentence]] reconstruction of physical theories&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, J. (2000), "Miracles and Models: Saving Structural Realism?", paper given to the Annual Meeting of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, Sheffield, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (a Ramsey sentence aims at rendering propositions containing non-observable theoretical terms clear by substituting them with observable terms). John Worrall and Elie Georges Zahar (2001) claim that Newman's objection applies only if a distinction between observational and theoretical terms is not made.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, J. and Zahar, E. (2001), "Ramseyfication and Structural Realism", Appendix IV in E. Zahar, ''Poincare's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology'', Chicago and La Salle (IL): Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Ramsey-style epistemic structural realism''' is distinct from and incompatible with the original '''Russellian epistemic structural realism'''&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; (the difference between the two being that Ramsey-style ESR makes an [[epistemic commitment]] to Ramsey sentences, while Russellian ESR makes an epistemic commitment to abstract structures, that is, to (second-order) isomorphism classes of the observational structure of the world and not the (first-order) physical structure itself).&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 43 and 122.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ioannis Votsis]] (2004) claims that Russellian ESR is ''also'' impervious to the Newman objection: Newman falsely attributed the trivial claim "there exists ''a'' relation with a particular abstract structure" to ESR, while ESR makes the non-trivial claim that there is a ''unique'' physical relation that is causally linked with a ''unique'' observational relation and the two are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further criticism&lt;!--linked from 'Causal theory of reference'--&gt;====
The traditional scientific realist and notable critic of structural realism&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; [[Stathis Psillos]] (1999) remarks that "structural realism is best understood as issuing an epistemic constraint on what can be known and on what scientific theories can reveal."&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; He thinks that ESR faces a number of insurmountable objections.&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 68–9.&lt;/ref&gt; These include among others that ESR's only epistemic commitment is uninterpreted equations which are not by themselves enough to produce predictions&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the "structure versus nature" distinction that ESR appeals to cannot be sustained.&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Votsis (2004) replies that the structural realist "does subscribe to interpreted equations, but attempts to distinguish between interpretations that link the terms to observations from those that do not"&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, pp. 73–4.&lt;/ref&gt; and he can appeal to the Russellian view that "nature" just means the non-isomorphically specifiable part of entities.&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Psillos also defends [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis's]] [[descriptive-causal theory of reference]]&lt;!--source says 'causal-descriptive', but 'descriptive-causal' is the term preferred in Lewisian-inspired literature--&gt;&lt;ref name=Psillos279&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; (according to which the abandoned theoretical terms after a theory change are regarded as successfully referring "after all")&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Psillos279/&gt; and claims that it can adequately deal with referential continuity in conceptual transitions, during which theoretical terms are abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; thus rendering ESR redundant.

Votsis (2004) replies that a scientific realist needs not tie the approximate truth of a theory to referential success.&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, structural realism initially did not dictate any particular [[theory of reference]];&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. (2004), ''The Epistemological Status of Scientific Theories: An Investigation of the Structural Realist Account'', University of London, London School of Economics, PhD Thesis, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; however Votsis (2012) proposed a '''structuralist theory of reference''' according to which "scientific terms are able to refer to individual objects, i.e. in a term-by-term fashion, but that to fix this reference requires taking into account the relations these objects instantiate."&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Votsis, [http://www.votsis.org/PDF/Votsis_Abstract_Structuralist_Theory_of_Reference.pdf "A Structuralist Theory of Reference"], Invited talk presented at the Reference and Scientific Realism Symposium, [[Wuhan University]], August 17 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontic structural realism&lt;!--'Ontic structural realism' redirects here--&gt;===
While ESR claims that only the structure of reality is knowable, '''[[Ontology|ontic]] structural realism''' ('''OSR''') goes further to claim that ''structure is all there is''. In this view, reality has no "nature" underlying its observed structure. Rather, reality is fundamentally structural, though variants of OSR disagree on precisely which aspects of structure are primitive. OSR is strongly motivated by modern physics, particularly [[quantum field theory]], which undermines intuitive notions of identifiable objects with intrinsic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, James, [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/structural-realism/ "Structural Realism"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Some early quantum physicists held this view, including [[Hermann Weyl]] (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weyl, 1950 [1931]. ''The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics'' (translated by H. P. Robertson). New York: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Cassirer]] (1936),&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, 1956 [1936]. ''Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics'', New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Eddington]] (1939).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Eddington (1939), ''The Philosophy of Physical Science'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, OSR has been called "the most fashionable ontological framework for modern physics".&lt;ref name=sep_qft&gt;Kuhlmann, Meinard, [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/quantum-field-theory/ "Quantum Field Theory"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;!-- edition is 2015, but last substantive revision was 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] takes this concept even further with the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]], which proposes that, if our universe is only a particular structure, then it is no more real than any other structure.&lt;ref name=tegmark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|title=Our mathematical universe : my quest for the ultimate nature of reality|date=2014|isbn=9780307744258|edition=First edition.|chapter=10: Physical Reality and Mathematical Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berthold, Oswald. "Computational universes." Berlin: Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Institut fur Informatik (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of structure==
{{See also|Structure (mathematical logic)}}
In mathematical logic, a mathematical structure is a standard concept. A mathematical structure is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of abstract entities with relations between them. The natural numbers under arithmetic constitute a structure, with relations such as "is evenly divisible by" and "is greater than". Here the relation "is greater than" includes the element (3, 4), but not the element (4, 3). Points in space and the real numbers under Euclidean geometry are another structure, with relations such as "the distance between point P1 and point P2 is real number R1"; equivalently, the "distance" relation includes the element (P1, P2, R1). Other structures include the [[Riemann space]] of general relativity and the [[Hilbert space]] of quantum mechanics. The entities in a mathematical structure do not have any independent existence outside their participation in relations. Two descriptions of a structure are considered equivalent, and to be describing the same underlying structure, if there is a correspondence between the descriptions that preserves all relations.&lt;ref name=tegmark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esfeld, Michael. "Ontic structural realism and the interpretation of quantum mechanics." ''European Journal for Philosophy of Science'' '''3'''.1 (2013): 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proponents of structural realism formally or informally ascribe "properties" to the abstract objects; some argue that such properties, while they can perhaps be "shoehorned" into the formalism of relations, should instead be considered distinct from relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ainsworth|first1=Peter Mark|title=What is ontic structural realism?|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=January 2010|volume=41|issue=1|pages=50–57|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed structures==
In [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), traditional proposals for "the most basic known structures" divide into "particle interpretations" such as ascribing reality to the [[Fock space]] of particles, and "field interpretations" such as considering the quantum wavefunction to be identical to the underlying reality. Varying [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] provide one complication; another, perhaps minor, complication is that neither fields nor particles are completely localized in standard QFT. A third, less obvious, complication is that "unitarily inequivalent representations" are endemic in QFT; for example, the same patch of spacetime can be represented by a vacuum by an inertial observer, but as a thermal heat bath by an accelerating observer that perceives [[Unruh radiation]], raising the difficult question of whether the vacuum structure or heat bath structure is the real structure, or whether both of these inequivalent structures are separately real. Another example, which does not require the complications of curved spacetime, is that in ferromagnetism, symmetry-breaking analysis results in inequivalent Hilbert spaces. More broadly, QFT's infinite degrees of freedom lead to inequivalent representations in the general case.&lt;ref name=sep_qft /&gt;

In [[general relativity]], scholars often grant a "basic structure" status to the spacetime structure, sometimes via its [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]].&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;

{{For|the event sometimes called the Technological Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Axe]] made of iron, dating from Swedish [[Iron Age]], found at [[Gotland Island|Gotland]], [[Sweden]]: the iron—as a new material—initiated a dramatic revolution in technology, economy, society, warfare and politics.]]
A '''technological revolution''' is a period in which one or more [[technology|technologies]] is replaced by another technology in a short amount of time. It is an era of accelerated [[technological progress]] characterized by new [[innovation]]s whose rapid [[wikt:application|application]] and [[diffusion]] cause an abrupt change in society.

A technological revolution is made of interconnected [[technological change|technological changes]]. 

==Description by Joseph C. Galisim==
[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The [[Spinning Jenny]] and [[Spinning Mule]] (shown) greatly increased the productivity of thread manufacturing compared to the [[spinning wheel]]]]
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|240px|A [[Watt steam engine]]—the [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by [[coal]], propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F077948-0006, Jugend-Computerschule mit IBM-PC.jpg|thumb|[[IBM Personal Computer XT]] in 1988—the PC was an invention that dramatically changed not only professional life, but personal life as well.]]
A technological revolution increases [[productivity]] and [[efficiency]]. It may involve material or ideological changes caused by the introduction of a device or system. Some examples of its potential impact are business management, education, social interactions, finance and research methodology; it is not limited strictly to technical  aspects. Technological revolution rewrites the material conditions of human  existence and can reshape culture. It can play a role of a trigger of a chain of various and unpredictable changes:&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Maury(2008): ''The Technological Revolution, in The Newsletter of Foreign Policy Research Institute, Vol.13, No. 18.'' [http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1318.200807.klein.techrevolution.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What distinguishes a technological revolution  from a random collection of technology systems and justifies conceptualizing it as a revolution are two basic features:

1. The strong interconnectedness and interdependence of the participating systems in their technologies and markets.

2. The capacity to transform profoundly the rest of the economy (and eventually society).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequences of a technological revolution are not necessarily positive. For example, innovations, such as the use of [[coal]] as an [[Energy development|energy source]], can have negative environmental impact and cause [[technological unemployment]]. The concept of technological revolution is based on the idea that [[technological progress]] is not [[linear]] but [[undulatory]]. Technological revolution can be:

* Sectoral (more technological changes in one sector, e.g. [[Green Revolution]] and [[Commercial Revolution]])
* Universal (interconnected radical changes in more sectors, the universal technological revolution can be seen as a complex of several parallel sectoral technological revolutions, e.g. [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]])

The concept of universal technological revolutions is a key factor in the Neo-Schumpeterian theory of long economic waves/cycles&lt;ref&gt;for example: Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/and/scissors/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Carlota Perez]], [[Tessaleno Devezas]], [[Daniel Šmihula]] and others).

==History==
The most known example of technological revolution was the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, the [[Information revolution|scientific-technical revolution]] about 1950–1960, the [[Neolithic revolution]], the [[Digital revolution]] and so on. The notion of "technological revolution" is frequently overused, therefore it is not easy to define which technological revolutions having occurred during [[world history]] were really crucial and influenced not only one segment of human activity, but had a universal impact. One universal technological revolution should be composed from several sectoral technological revolutions (in science, industry, transport and the like).

We can identify several universal technological revolutions which occurred during the [[modern era]] in [[Western culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;based on: Šmihula, Daniel (2011): ''Long waves of technological innovations, Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69. [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1. Financial-agricultural revolution (1600–1740)
* 2. Industrial revolution (1780–1840)
* 3. Technical revolution or [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1870–1920)
* 4. Scientific-technical revolution (1940–1970) 
* 5. Information and telecommunications revolution (1975–present)

Attempts to find comparable periods of well defined technological revolutions in the [[pre-modern era]] are highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;for example: Drucker, Peter F. (1965):''The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons.'' [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/d_rucker5.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably one of the most systematic attempts to suggest a timeline of technological revolutions in pre-modern [[Europe]] was done by Daniel Šmihula:&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2011): [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20 ''Long waves of technological innovations''], Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69&lt;/ref&gt;   
* A. Indo-European  technological revolution (1900–1100 BC) 
* B. Celtic and Greek technological revolution (700–200 BC)
* C. Germano-Slavic technological revolution (300–700 AD)
* D. Medieval technological revolution (930–1200 AD)
* E. Renaissance technological revolution (1340–1470 AD)

==Potential future technological revolutions==
After 2000 there became popular the idea that a sequence of technological revolutions is not over and in the forthcoming future we will witness the dawn of a new universal technological revolution. The main innovations should develop in the fields of [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]], [[alternative energy|alternative fuel and energy systems]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]], [[genetic engineering]], new materials technologies and so on .&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Anton,  Richard Silberglitt, James Schneider (2001): [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1307.pdf ''The Global Technology Revolution - Bio/Nano/Materials Trends and Their Synergies with Information Technology by 2015.''], RAND, {{ISBN|0-8330-2949-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to "technological revolution" and "technical revolution"==
Sometimes the notion of "technological revolution" is used for the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the period about 1900, but in this case the designation "technical revolution" would be more proper. When the notion of [[technical revolution]] is used in more general meaning it is almost identical with technological revolution, but technological revolution requires material changes in used tools, machines, energy sources, production processes. Technical revolution can be restricted to changes in  management, organisation and so called non-material [[technologies]] (e.g. a progress in [[mathematics]] or [[accounting]]).

==List of intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions (sectoral or universal)==
[[File:PPF expansion.svg|thumb|right|Technological revolution can cause the [[production-possibility frontier]] to shift outward and initiate economic growth]]
* The [[Upper Paleolithic Revolution]]: the emergence of "high culture", new technologies and regionally distinct cultures (50,000–40,000 years ago).
* The [[Neolithic Revolution]] (perhaps 13,000 years ago), which formed the basis for human civilization to develop.
* The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]]: the set of inventions during the Renaissance period, roughly the 14th through the 16th century.
* The [[Commercial Revolution]]: a period of European economic expansion, [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] which lasted  from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century.
* The [[Price revolution|Price Revolution]]: a series of economic events from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, the price revolution refers most specifically to the high rate of inflation that characterized the period across [[Western Europe]].
* The [[Scientific Revolution]]: a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas around the 16th century.
* The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] (18th century), which spurred urbanisation and consequently helped launch the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* The [[Industrial Revolution]]: the major shift of technological, socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the late 18th century and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world.
* The [[Market Revolution]]: a drastic change in the manual labor system originating in the South of the [[United States]] (and soon moving to the North) and later spreading to the entire world (about 1800–1900).
* The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1871–1914).
* The [[Green Revolution]] (1945–1975): the use of industrial fertilizers and new crops greatly increased the world's agricultural output.
* The [[Digital Revolution]]: the sweeping changes brought about by [[computing]] and [[communication technology]], starting from circa 1950 with the creation of the first general-purpose [[electronic computer]]s.
* The [[Information revolution|Information Revolution]]: the massive economic, social and technological changes resulting from the Digital Revolution (after 1960?).

'''''The Department of Mad Scientists: How DARPA is Remaking Our World''''', from the Internet to Artificial Limbs is a book by [[Michael Belfiore (author)|Michael Belfiore]] about the history and origins of [[DARPA]]. Belfiore describes DARPA's creation as the agency ARPA in [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and some of its notable contributions to artificial limbs, the Internet, space exploration and robotic automobiles.

Belfiore also highlights some of the unique aspects of DARPA's internal structure such as term limits for project managers, willingness to fund ambitious research, and subcontracting of all research.

[[File:nakedape.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover]]
'''''The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal''''' (Hardback: {{ISBN|0-07-043174-4}}; Reprint: {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}) is a 1967 book by [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[ethology|ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] that looks at [[human]]s as a [[species]] and compares them to other animals. ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', a follow-up book by Morris that examined the behaviour of people in cities, was published in 1969.

==Summary==
''The Naked Ape'', which was serialised in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper and has been translated into 23 languages, depicts human behaviour as largely [[evolutionary psychology|evolved]] to meet the challenges of prehistoric life as a [[hunter]] (see [[nature versus nurture]]).  The book was so named because out of 193 species of [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s, only humans (''Homo sapiens sapiens'') are not covered in hair. Desmond Morris, the author, who had been the curator of [[mammal]]s at [[London Zoo]], said his book was intended to popularise and demystify science.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_3116000/3116329.stm BBC ON THIS DAY | 12 | 1967: The Naked Ape steps out]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris said that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' not only have the largest brains of all higher primates, but that [[sexual selection in human evolution]] has caused humans to have the highest ratio of penis size to body mass. Morris conjectured that human [[ear-lobes]] developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding. Morris further stated that the more rounded shape of human female [[breast]]s means they are mainly a sexual signalling device rather than simply for providing milk for infants.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; 

Morris framed many features of human behaviour in the context of [[evolution]] at a time when cultural explanations were more orthodox.  For example, Morris wrote that the intense human pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other men, and suggested the possibility that sparse body hair evolved because the "nakedness" helped intensify pair bonding by increasing tactile pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robert. The Moral Animal: Why We Are, the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology. Vintage. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other writers in the late 1960s and 1970s, Morris warned against the "[[population explosion]]"  and overcrowding that might cause terminal damage to heretofore relatively stable social structures that humans had evolved in the long course of their development.

==Film adaptations==
[[The Naked Ape (film)|A 1973 film]] directed by Donald Driver, very loosely based on the book, was made starring [[Johnny Crawford]] and [[Victoria Principal]]. In 2006, an independent film was made, based loosely on the book, written and directed by Daniel Mellitz, starring [[Josh Wise (actor)|Josh Wise]], [[Chelse Swain]], Sean Shanks, Amanda MacDonald, Tony LaThanh, [[Corbin Bernsen]]. Beyond their scripts being loosely based on his book, Morris was not involved in either movie in any way.

In February 1976, the book was removed from high school library shelves by the board of education of the [[Island Trees Union Free School District]] in New York.{{efn|''The Naked Ape'' was one of nine books in the school library that were determined to be "improper fare for school students" and removed from shelves.

'''''The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York''''' is a ''New York Times'' best-selling non-fiction book by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning science writer [[Deborah Blum]] that was released by [[Penguin Press]] in 2010.

==Synopsis==
In 1918, [[New York City]] appointed [[Charles Norris (medical examiner)|Charles Norris]], [[Bellevue Hospital]]'s chief pathologist, as its first scientifically trained [[medical examiner]]. The book, about Norris and [[Alexander Gettler]], the city's first toxicologist, describes the [[Jazz Age]]'s poisoning cases. Before the two began working in the medical examiner's office, Blum pointed out in her book, poisoners could get away with murder. The book covers the years from 1915 to 1936, which Blum described as a "coming-of-age" for [[forensic toxicology]]. "Under (Norris's) direction, the New York City medical examiner's office would become a department that set forensic standards for the rest of the country," Blum wrote.

While a guest on [[National Public Radio]]’s "Talk of the Nation/Science Friday" to discuss the book, Blum told host [[Ira Flatow]] that she wrote the book because, "I've always been interested in poison. I wanted to write about the mystery of how (poisons) kill us.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crime-and-justice-news.newslib.com/story/8214-102004/ |title=NPR transcript, "Science And Crime Mix In 'The Poisoner’s Handbook," May 30, 2010 |publisher=Crime-and-justice-news.newslib.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Reader's Digest]]'' named ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' one of its Top 10 best crime books, saying, "This is science writing at its finest that reads like a mystery novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/culture/best-true-crime-books/|title=Best True Crime Books to Add to Your List - Reader's Digest|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each chapter centers on a mysterious death by poison that Norris and Gettler investigate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/books/review/East-t.html |title=Murder by the Drop |publisher=NYTimes.com |date= February 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Not only is ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' as thrilling as any 'CSI' episode," wrote reviewer Art Taylor with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "but it also offers something even better: an education in how forensics really works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Art |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2010-02-21/news/36825093_1_cyanide-case-first-chief-medical-examiner-forensic-medicine |title=The science of murder - Washington Post |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes and Noble's editor's review said this: "The book is an unexpected yet appropriate open-sesame into a world that was planting seeds for the world -- with lethal toxins and cutting-edge tools -- that would later, darkly bloom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hales |first=Dianne R. |url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/The-Criminalist/The-Poisoner-s-Handbook/ba-p/2175 |title=The Poisoner's Handbook - The Barnes &amp; Noble Review |publisher=Bnreview.barnesandnoble.com |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Weldon from NPR Books said:  "Rigorously researched and thoroughly engaging, ''The Poisoner's Handbook'' is a compelling, comprehensive portrait of the time and place that transformed criminal investigation, and made it much more difficult for that most insidious of murderers to escape the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124472649|title='The Poisoner's Handbook': CSI's Jazz Age Roots|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In US [[academia]], a '''visiting scholar''', '''visiting researcher''', '''visiting fellow''', '''visiting lecturer''' or '''visiting professor''' is a scholar from an institution who visits a host university and is projected to teach, lecture, or perform research on a topic the visitor is valued for.&lt;ref&gt;CMU. [http://www.cmu.edu/mcs/handbook/nonsalary.html "MCS Non-Salaried Scholarly Appointments: Visiting scholar appointments"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824001210/http://www.cmu.edu/mcs/handbook/nonsalary.html |date=2007-08-24 }}. [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the position is not salaried because the scholar typically is salaried by their home institution (or partially salaried, as in some cases of [[sabbatical leave]] from US universities), while some visiting positions are salaried. 

Typically, a position as visiting scholar is for a couple of months or even a year,&lt;ref&gt;HLS. [http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/graduate/admissions/vrvs.php "Visiting Scholar and Researcher (VS/VR) Program"]. [[Harvard Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UT. [http://www.utexas.edu/research/resources/visiting-scholar-researcher-program "Visiting Scholar"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304063017/http://www.utexas.edu/research/resources/visiting-scholar-researcher-program |date=2015-03-04 }}. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt; though it can be extended. It is not unusual that host institutions provide accommodation for the visiting scholar. Typically, a visiting scholar is invited by the host institution. Being invited as a visiting scholar is often regarded as a significant accolade and recognition of the scholar's prominence in the field. Attracting prominent visiting scholars often allows the permanent faculty and graduate students to cooperate with prominent academics from other institutions, especially foreign ones.

In the UK, a visiting scholar or visiting academic usually has to pay a so-called '''bench fee''' to the university, which will give them access to a shared office space and other university facilities and resources (such as the library). Bench fee amounts vary across the UK universities. 

==Overview==
The purpose of a visiting scholars programs is generally to bring to the university or educational institution in question an exceptional senior scholar who can contribute to and enrich the community's intellectual and research endeavors and international projection. Hence, in addition to conducting their own research, visitors are often expected to actively participate in a number of productive institutional activities, such as:

* Deliver a formal lecture to the host institution
* Engage in formal or informal discussions with graduate or postgraduate research students 
* Undertake collaborative research with faculty or staff 
* Contribute to the university's teaching by presenting guest lectures or faculty seminars
* Present a paper as part of the university's seminar program
