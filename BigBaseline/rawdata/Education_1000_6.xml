      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37118">'''[[Academic freedom]] in the Middle East''' is a contested and debated issue, which has caught regional and international attention. In the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa (MENA)]] region, in general, the authoritarian regimes have all showed a certain degree of opposition to every sort of freedom, academic one not excluded, regardless of the type of regime basis they had. Freedom for academicians to inquiry, research, teach and communicate ideas or report facts without being threatened or persecuted or with the possibility of losing their position, being censored or repressed is threatened. What contributes to academic freedom violations is also that they are essential elements for the regimes to maintain their power and in addition to this issue, interstate and civil wars as well as internal disorders and external intervention can damage educational structures and institutions. Additionally, as far as the regime is concerned, a security or national threat can be a pretest for suffocate or suspend academic research and debate. Restrictions on academic freedom also regards the topics of research, which are under significant constraints, although these might be highly interesting and worth researching.

==Background==
There are many organizations that deal with monitoring violations of academic freedom and report academicians' voices, through publishing letters directed to public figures and also directed to the international community.

===Scholars at Risk===
[[Scholars at Risk]] is an international network based in the United States, specifically at the University of Chicago. The aim of this organization is to support scholars and defend academic freedom and human rights all over the world. One of the projects of this network is the Academic Freedom Monitor.

====Reported cases from Academic Freedom Monitor====
The online website Academic Freedom Monitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with reporting violations related to academic freedom. It is based on robust sources of information, which come from independent actors and are, then, verified. According to the Academic Freedom Monitor, which reports cases since 2010 until now, there are different categories of violation regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info|title=Home Page - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.academicfreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the Middle East and Northern Africa, the AFM registers cases in: Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Kuwait, Yemen, Iraq, Palestine (OPT), Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia.

==== Types of violations ====
Academic Freedom Monitor identifies different types of violations as following:
* Killings, violence or disappearances
* Wrongful imprisonment/detention
* Wrongful prosecution
* Restrictions on travel or movement
* Retaliatory discharge or loss of position/expulsion from study
* Other significant events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitoring.academicfreedom.info/monitoring|title=Monitoring - Academic freedom monitor|website=monitoring.AcademicFreedom.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee on Academic Freedom===
[[Middle East Studies Association of North America|The Middle East Studies Association (MESA)]] is an association which brings together scholars and informed people with an interested in the MENA region. This association is the promoter of the ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' and has the aim to promote cooperation, communication and boost the learning regarding the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/about/index.html|title=About MESA|website=MESANA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fields it is dealing with regards academic freedom. This association has created a Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF), which aims to remove any obstacle regarding the exchange of knowledge and any restrictions on academicians coming also from governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesana.org/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|website=MESANA.org|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
=== History ===
Academic freedom in Turkey has been through a series of changes and fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Summak, M Semih. “Academic Human Rights and Freedoms in Turkey.” ''The Educational Forum'' 62, no. 1 (1997): 32–39. doi:10.1080/00131729708982678.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often irregular, inadequate and closely tied to the politics in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weiker, Walter F. “Academic Freedom and Problems of Higher Education in Turkey.” ''Middle East Journal'' 16, no. 3 (1962): 279–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Balyer, Aydın. “Academic Freedom : Perceptions of Academics in Turkey Akademik Özgürlük : Türkiye ’ Deki Akademisyenlerin Algıları” 36, no. 162 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norris, Kristin E, Academic Freedom and University Autonomy: A comparative analysis of the Turkish higher education system. (2011). http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2486&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Education in Turkey#History|reform]] initiatives have been taken throughout Turkey's history which aim at restructuring governance of higher education and thus affecting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Doğan, Didem. “Academic Freedom from the Perspectives of Academics and Students: A Qualitative Study.” ''TeEği̇ti̇m VBi̇li̇m'' 41, no. 184 (2016): 25–32. doi:10.15390/EB.2016.6135.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reform initiative was in 1933, as Malche was invited by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] to restructure [[Istanbul University|Istanbul University (Istanbul Darülfünun)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Üvey, Doðan|author2=Gökçe, Ayse Nur|title="The Role of Prof. Dr. Albert Malche in 1933 university reform in turkey." |journal=Acta - Congressus Historiae Pharmaciae|date=2001|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F25595219FD4268916676FA70A746DE?doi=10.1.1.613.7020&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the reforms that made it to the law 2252 was according [[List of universities in Turkey|universities]] with more freedom. In 1946, the Law Number 4936 accorded universities with unprecedented rights, as academicians were seen as guardians of democracy second to the military.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
The [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|Democratic Party]] in 1953 passed laws that would undermine the universities' control over their budget, retirement of academicians and their employment rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those attacks on academic freedom were aimed at confining professors from being involved in partisan politics resulting in several cases of suspensions of academicians and denial of promotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup]] was seen as a promise for reversal of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–61)|DP]]'s encroachment over university autonomy, as it recruited academicians in government offices, selected to write the constitution and other vital roles. However, the 1960 coup junta surprisingly dismissed 147 academicians who were not in agreement with some members of the junta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
In 1973, higher education was restructured with the increased sovereignty of the Interuniversity Council (ÜAK), while at the same time universities were given complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== The Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ====
The current Higher Education Law was implemented in 1981 following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The law maintains that, “universities are judicial structures which are managed and supervised by the organs selected among them. University organs, academics and teaching assistants cannot be removed from their posts for no reason by authorities outside the university” (YÖK 2007).&lt;ref&gt;The Council of Higher Education. ''The Law on Higher Education 1981''. The Republic of Turkey: Official Gazette No: 17506, published in English by Ankara Üniversitesi Basimevi (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet academic freedom became too dependent on [[Council of Higher Education (Turkey)|The Council of Higher Education (YÖK)]] as the reform moved towards creating a more centralized system around the YÖK in matters regarding budgetary control, staff employment and student selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The law defines the name, number and discipline of each faculty or vocational school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While universities can establish departments, their approval is subject to the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Egypt==
===History===
Egypt is one of the countries where [[academic freedom]] is not a right freely enjoyed. Since the start of the 1990s, academics in Egypt have faced several forms of repression and endured many violations such as judicial convictions, public condemnation, and physical violence from both private individuals and groups, mainly the Islamists, and government officials.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, there are Egyptian state authorities using [[Egyptian National Police|police]], political appointees, and regulations and laws to control university life. On the other hand, Islamist militants are resorting to physical violence and public attacks to have a say in the content of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Reading between the "Red Lines”: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities.” Vol. 17, No. 6, June 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
All aspects of university life including the classroom, student activities, research, campus demonstrations were affected by government and private repression. The professors and students find themselves censored and enable to cross the “red lines” of politics, religion, and sex.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 2005, p. 25"/&gt;
Faculty appointments and promotions are controlled by the state. Student activities are limited once outside the classroom, and campus protests are often violently responded to. All these factors contribute to the deterioration of the academic freedom situation in Egypt and to the general decline of the educational environment.

====Sisi's era====
While Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|2014 Egyptian constitution]], issued under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]’s rule, ensures that “the state guarantees the independence of universities, scientific and linguistic academies” and that “it commits to providing university education in accordance with global quality criteria, and to developing free university education in state universities and institutes as per the law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian state still violates its constitutional provisions through various repressive ways in an attempt to curb academic freedom. Article 23 of the constitution claims that “the state grants the freedom of scientific research and encourages its institutions.”{{cite web|title=Egypt’s Constitution of 2014|website=Constituteproject.org|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, freedom of scientific research has often been interfered with and even hindered on various occasions by state authorities. [[Egyptian universities|Universities]] under Sisi’s rule have been described as “experiencing the lowest levels of academic freedom the country has ever known."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crane Linn, Emily. “Egypt’s Besieged Universities: The Country’s Scholars had better teach from President Sisi’s Textbook- or else.” Foreign Policy. 31 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many observers maintained that the violations against Egyptian academics under [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|El-Sisi]]’s rule exceed those witnessed during [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] time. In academic year 2014, 761 student arrests and 281 student expulsions took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Moreover, the state sentenced to death a university professor for writing critical articles about the regime and accused him of “conspiring to undermine Egypt’s national security”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and arrested many others who dared to criticize the regime.
The state also monitors what ideas come in and not just the research that comes out. Several universities are canceling their study abroad programs or breaking off their cooperations with foreign universities. For example, Cairo’s [[Ain Shams University]] canceled its study abroad program to Turkey and [[Damanhour University]] stopped its cooperation with foreign institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, El-Sisi issued a decree banning any academic travel outside Egypt that does not have a prior [[State Security Investigations Service|State Security]] authorization. This way, the state would be able to control which conferences can be attended and what sources can be used. Even though this decree and many other violations are, according to the articles mentioned above, unconstitutional, they are still enforced.

===Violations===
There are various cases of academic freedom violations in Egypt. The following are just few of them. Professor Kholoud Saber had her scholarship abroad terminated by [[Cairo University]]. She was doing a doctoral research on a scholarship at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, that started on October 2015, when she was ordered to return to Egypt following a recommendation of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Egypt)|Ministry of Higher education]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Press Release: “Cairo’s University Decision Demonstrates the Erosion of University Independence and its Reliance on Dictates of Ministry of Higher Education, which acts as a Cover for Security Intervention in Universities.” 10 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Ohier, a French Master’s student, was arrested and later deported from Egypt. She was working on the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group banned by the government as it was accused of state defamation and espionage.&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She was not given any reason for her arrest by the Egyptian officials but she, reportedly, overheard police officers claiming “she had improper friends.”&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 13"/&gt;
On another instance, scholar and journalist Ismail Alexandrani was detained, on November 2015, upon his return Egypt from a workshop in Germany. The Egyptian embassy in Berlin had apparently advised the scholar, who happens to be “a vocal critic of human rights violations in Egypt and counterterrorism policy in the Sinai Peninsula,” not to turn up to the workshop titled “Deconstructing Islamist Egypt"&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"&gt;Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. “Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project.” 2016, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Mr. Alexandrani’s arrival to Egypt, his passport was confiscated and he was questioned for over 19 hours before getting arrested “on charges of ‘joining and supporting a terrorist organization’ and ‘spreading false news liable to disturb public security and harm public interest."&lt;ref name="Risk 2016, p. 14"/&gt;

===Giulio Regeni case===
One of the most widely covered stories in relation to the situation of academic freedom in Egypt was the case of the Italian PhD candidate [[Giulio Regeni]], a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK. Giulio Regeni was first found dead, in the outskirts of Cairo, a week after he was declared missing on January 25, 2016, which coincided with the fifth anniversary of the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian uprising]], and his body demonstrated clear signs of torture and severe beating.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars at Risk: Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. "Free to Think: Report of the Scholars at Risk Academic Freedom Monitoring Project."|date=2016|url=https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free_to_Think_2016.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholarsatrisk.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PhD candidate was investigating the [[Trade unions in Egypt|Egyptian labor movements]] at the [[American University in Cairo|American University of Cairo]] at the time of his murder. While government officials maintained that Regeni was kidnapped and murdered by a gang, international and Egyptian human rights activists claim that he was actually targeted for his research by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;
The murder of Giulio Regeni remains unsolved. 
The case of the researcher, and the continuing imprisonment of hundreds of scholars and thousands of students and the various restrictions on academic freedom signal that there is an actual “not improvement but, rather, a further tightening of control, and loss of autonomy and freedom in Egyptian higher education, as well as a shrinkiHing{{clarify|date=June 2017}} space for critical inquiry and discourse in Egypt generally."&lt;ref name="scholarsatrisk.org"/&gt;

==Israel==
{{POV|date=March 2017}}

=== History ===
In the 1990s, Israeli academia was characterized by open-mindedness and pluralist vision of debated issues such as revisionist history on [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]] that was finding its way into the academic society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Struggle for Academic Freedom in Israel|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Second Intifada]] and its aftermath, these characteristics gradually vanished also due to the disappearance of [[Israeli Left|Israeli left]] parties, which in fact used to host a great part of Israeli academia and when leftish positions started to change, this influenced the academic environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Palestinian academia&lt;!-- This sub-section needs some attention. There are many statements made here that are not backed up with secondary sources. For this reason this section reads more like an academic paper than a Wikipedia article. Remember that it is necessary to write from as neutral a position as possible - so every statement you must ask yourself "would someone want to contest this claim?" and if yes ask yourself what you can do to back it up as much as possible. If you cannot find secondary sources for some of these ideas/statements than you need to remove them.   There are several instances in this sub-section where a secondary source is necessary to validate the statement - even if it an event, it must be validated with an external source.  --&gt; ===
In what it is considered by many international actors a situation of military occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories|title=Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories|website=Amnesty International USA|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/un-report-on-palestine-military-occupation-apartheid-torture-israeli-violations-are-deliberate-organised-and-institutionalised/5372212|title=UN Report on Palestine: Military Occupation, Apartheid, Torture – Israeli Violations are "Deliberate, Organised, and Institutionalised"|last=Falk|first=Richard|date=2014-03-07|website=Global Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its consequent policies of [[collective punishment]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/palestinians-israel-collective-punishment-160929083644838.html|title='Bad Palestinians' under Israel's collective punishment|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denial of entrance&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;!-- A statement like this should be backed up with sources in order to demonstrate that it is not an opinion but actually 'fact'. Also it would be helpful if you could add more explanation when you write of 'collective punishments' and 'denial of entrance'. Remember that you are an expert on the topic, however other Wikipedia readers are not so these types of statements need some background information - even if you can provide sources and link it to another page that discusses this more thoroughly. --&gt;, such as checkpoints and the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|wall]] between [[Israel]] and [[West Bank]], in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]] access to education for Palestinians has thus been affected&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Laurie A.|year=2007|title=Middle East Studies and Academic Freedom: Challenges at Home and Abroad|url=|journal=International Studies Perspectives|volume=8|pages=385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again add a source to this claim. --&gt;. In fact, straight after the beginning of the [[first Intifada]], the ability for the students of West Bank Universities to study and carry on theirs studies have been limited, while later on, in 2006, a travel ban to get into Israel was issued for Palestinian students belonging to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/ministers-demand-entry-into-israel-for-palestinian-students-1.202733|title=Ministers Demand Entry Into Israel for Palestinian Students|first1=Akiva|last1=Eldar|first2=Yoav|last2=Stern|date=18 October 2006|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedure go along with a series of entry and residence denials for researchers and students, both foreign passport holders and Palestinian-born, which have threatened the ability of carrying on a proper educational and research level in Palestinian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kibush.co.il/downloads/Letter_from_University_Presidents.pdf|format=PDF|title=To Members of Global Civil Society and Academia|website=Kibush.co.il|access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported various violations perpetrated by Israeli authorities on students, in the academic and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the exit permits. In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ takeover of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that left for their studies remained once again trapped when they returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained exit permits, students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in [[Erez]], with the justification of “security concerns”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/11/19/gaza-israel-blocks-670-students-studies-abroad|title=Gaza: Israel Blocks 670 Students from Studies Abroad|date=2007-11-19|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/02/us-challenge-israels-restrictions-gaza-students|title=US: Challenge Israel’s Restrictions on Gaza Students|date=2008-06-02|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the organization again stated how discrimination by Israeli authorities prevented many Palestinian students from the [[Gaza Strip]] to travel abroad or to the West Bank to get a better education&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch" /&gt;&lt;!-- where are your sources for this? --&gt;. Regarding the chances to travel abroad, in 2008, grants allocated for the Palestinians chosen to study in the United States were redirected because there was no way those students would be allowed by Israel to leave Gaza. For the inability to get visa, the grants destined to Gaza students were transferred to students in the West Bank. The organization has highlighted the necessity and the right for those students to access higher education abroad, since in the Gaza Strip the opportunity are quite limited. For instance, there is not a wide range of degrees, both undergraduate and master’s, in the four available universities. Moreover, there is a total absence of doctoral degrees, and lecturers and teachers from outside are hardly allowed by the Israeli government to enter and teach in Gaza.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/01/letter-secretary-state-condoleeza-rice-gazan-students|title=Letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Gazan Students|date=1 June 2008|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=12 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This blockade is said to be a clear violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], because Israel’s obligation to guarantee the rights of the people under occupation, among which freedom of movement and right to education display, is inconsistent or not committed at all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; However, according to international law, Gaza is not occupied since Israel no longer has any military presence in Gaza and Gaza has its own, independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/11/13/why-gaza-is-not-remotely-occupied-i/|title=Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)|first=Eugene|last=Kontorovich|date=13 November 2014|publisher=|access-date=18 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of restrictions regarding [[academic freedom]] affects also Israeli scholars, such as [[Ilan Pappé|Ilan Pappe]], an Israeli Jew, who has been forced to resign for the [[University of Haifa]] in 2007 for his academic work and political positions, such as academic boycott of Israel. The scholar started researching on the history of the creation of the state of Israel and elaborated a revisionist historical perspective regarding 1948 war. He received along with his family death threats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Ma'an News Agency|Ma’an News]], in February 2014, he was asked about academic freedom in Israel and especially regarding his personal experience. This is what he stated:

“Freedom of academic expression in Israel is a bit like the idea of a Israel being a Jewish democracy. You take a universal concept -- everyone has the right to their opinion and everyone has the right to be part of a democracy -- only with one condition: that the universality does not include critique on Zionism and that the democracy would always ensure Jewish majority whatever the demographic and geographical realities are.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=664867|title=Interview: Ilan Pappe on academic freedom in Israel and BDS|website=Maan News Agency|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
=== History ===
During the years that followed the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian revolution]], hundreds of academicians and students were killed as a consequence of a highly violent campaign that aimed to repress academic freedom, silence dissent, and enforce uniformity of thought.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. “Iran’s Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''The Hill''. November 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedoms of speech, association, and peaceful assembly of thousands of students and faculty members were breached through various methods of brutality, torture and detention. The reasons behind the arrests and torture ranged from “participating in illegal gatherings”, “propaganda against the system”, to “insulting the supreme leader or government officials.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Other tens of thousands of students and faculty members were forced out of their education and careers and into exile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These assaults on academic freedom continued all throughout the 1980s and became a salient feature of the newly established republic. Paradoxically, it was in universities where the initial revolutionary ‘texts’, aimed to oust the Shah, were produced and circulated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, universities came to represent the de facto ‘spaces’ where open-ended critical discourse was taking place. Nevertheless, they became the primary target of attack after the fall of the monarchy and the rise of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Contemporary Era ====
A merciless{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} campaign of repression has been waged by the Iranian authorities against [[academic freedom]] during the last three decades. Academics and students were routinely detained, harassed and expelled from universities because of their beliefs, political affiliations and peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Amnesty International. “Persecution in Universities as Iran ‘squeezes the life out of’ academic freedom.” ''Amnesty.org.'' June 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coercion and repressive methods was stepped up after the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The latter attempted to ‘Islamize’ the educational curriculum through purging it from secular and ‘Western’ influences. Furthermore, a large number of students and academics were barred from universities, following a policy of “starring” that punished those who do not conform to the state's political and social views. The government of President Ahmadinejad also introduced a quota system to limit the number of women in universities and measures to prevent them from enrolling in a list of courses considered more appropriate for men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A firm iron grip was retained over academic institutions by the Iranian authorities to the degree of allowing intelligence bodies and state security to supervise disciplinary proceedings in universities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The next president who assumed office in 2013, [[Hassan Rouhani]]—considered by many as a ‘reformist’-, made some steps to permit the return of several banned academics and students to campuses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Nonetheless, the situation of academic freedom remained critical with hundreds of students still imprisoned and others newly arrested since the election of President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]]. By the end of the academic year under the administration of the latter, various restrictions breaching academic freedom and introduced during the time of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] remained in place.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Violations ===
Several international instruments, to which Iran is party and accepted, such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]), and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly guarantee the right to education to all people without discrimination.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Human Rights Watch. “Iran: Government Assault on Academic Freedom.” ''Human Rights Watch''. May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the rights of individuals to freedoms of association, expression, opinion, and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity or political opinion, are further protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) and the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ([[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, students and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements of their rights based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security network.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Student activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted on a regular basis due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 election]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The case of Professor [[Homa Hoodfar]] ===
A Canadian-Iranian professor of anthropology from [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, [[Homa Hoodfar]], was detained in Iran on the 6th of June, 2016.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bothwell, Ellie. “Professor Imprisoned in Iran: Academic Freedom ‘Not a Western import’.” ''Times Higher Education News''. December 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interrogated for three months before being locked in a small cell in [[Evin Prison]] by the Iranian intelligence service.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Evin Prison|Evin prison]] in Iran is referred to as ‘Evin University’ due to the large number of intellectuals detained there.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] spent 112 days in prison for meddling in affairs of “feminism and security matters.” She was released in September 2016 on “humanitarian grounds” after Canada’s cooperation with officials from Oman, Switzerland and Italy to ensure her release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Canada worked with the latter countries because it cut its direct diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

Professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] later reported that even though she was not physically abused, the interrogations were severely psychologically distressing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The questioning would last from 9am to 7pm in a basement, where professor [[Homa Hoodfar|Hoodfar]] would either be facing a wall or a mirror preventing her from seeing her interrogators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As examples of psychological abuse, the professor revealed that one day, during questioning, Iranian officials played a song from her husband’s funeral that took place two years before, after they had found a clip of it on her iPad. In another instance, they displayed a picture of “her mother standing at her father’s graveside.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

An '''acting workshop''' is  a meeting of actors or others of one specific trade to learn how to hone their skills and to [[social network|network]] with other actors, [[acting coach]]es, and casting directors.  Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, [[audition]]s, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.

==Specialist types==
There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.  
==Examples==
Specialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is [[Dewar Studios]] in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.

An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[image:Leonhard-Eißnert-Park 06.jpg|thumb|Forest Adventure Park]]
[[image:Hochseilgarten Isselburg.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park on Poles]]
[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

}}'''American College Personnel Association - College Student Educators International''' is a major [[student affairs]] association headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[National Center for Higher Education]].

Founded in 1924 by [[May L. Cheney]], ACPA has 7,500 members representing 1,200 private and public institutions from across the U.S. and around the world. Members include organizations and companies that are engaged in the campus marketplace. Members also include graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in student affairs/higher education administration programs, faculty, and student affairs professionals, from entry level to senior student affairs officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219091154/http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.  September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual convention ==

Nearly 50% of ACPA's members attend the convention. Highlights of the convention include pre-convention workshops, over 300 educational sessions, interviewing at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611112731/http://careercentral.myacpa.org/home/index.cfm?site_id=8582], volunteering and networking opportunities. During the convention, job applicants and employers participate in one of the largest and most comprehensive placement service in student affairs. The 2013 convention will be in Las Vegas (2013), chaired by Karen Warren-Coleman (University of Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219163126/http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 Louisville Convention was chaired by Steve Sutton (University of California at Berkeley). Past convention chairs include Patricia Perillo (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University) for 2011, Robin Diana (Hartwick College) for 2010, Jonathan Poullard (University of California at Berkeley) for 2009, and Sue Saunders (University of Connecticut) for 2008.

== History ==

'''1924''' - [[May L. Cheney]], who organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley helped form the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS). In 1924, NAAS met for the first time and came as guests of the [[National Association of Deans of Women]] (NADW) to a convention sponsored by the Department Superintendence of the National Education Association.

'''1929''' - Forty-six NAAS members registered for the Sixth Annual Convention. NAAS became the National Association of Personnel and Placement Officers (NAPPO).

'''1930s''' - The name [http://www.myacpa.org American College Personnel Association] (ACPA) was adopted in 1931. Association communication consisted of one mailed newsletter, the Personnel-O-Gram (P-O-G). In 1937, the Student Point of View statement was developed by leaders of the [http://www.acenet.edu American Council on Education] (ACE) and ACPA.

'''1940s''' - The Journal for Educational and Psychological Measurement (EPM) became the next form of the association's newsletter communication in 1943. In 1947, ACPA's President Daniel D. Feder's recommendation for formal unification efforts led to the formation of the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA). No conferences were held from 1943 through 1945 during World War Two.

'''1950s''' - The Personnel and Guidance Journal replaced EPM as ACPA's official journal in 1952. ACPA members approved the plan to form APGA. Membership reached 1,000 in 1952 and continued to increase through the next two decades. In 1959, Charles Lewis, the P-O-G associate editor was named the first editor of the Journal of College Student Personnel, ACPA's new official journal.

'''1970s''' - ACPA collaborated with other national organizations on many national conventions. In 1973, ACPA and NAWDC (formerly NADW) coordinated a national convention. The Standing Committee for Women was established in 1973. In 1974, NAWDAC (name change for NAWDC), NASPA and ACPA coordinated a national convention. In 1976, membership totaled 9,384 at a record high. The Standing Committee for Multicultural Affairs was founded in 1978. In 1979, ACPA became one of the first members of the  [[Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education]] (CAS).

'''1980s''' - ACPA flourished under the presidential leadership of outstanding student affairs practitioners and faculty members such as Susan Komives, Margaret "Peggy" Barr and Dennis Roberts. In 1983, ACPA was incorporated under the District of Columbia Non-Profit Act. In 1987, ACPA and NASPA held a joint meeting in Chicago to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Student Personnel Point of View statement. In 1988, ACPA's premier journal was renamed [https://web.archive.org/web/20070827071906/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/pub_jcsd.cfm THE JOURNAL COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT] (JCSD).

'''1990s''' - In 1991, after 40 years, ACPA leaders and members voted to disaffiliate from APGA, which was known as the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD), and was later renamed the American Counseling Association (ACA). In September 1992, the separation became effective, and ACPA moved into a new office space at the National Center for Higher Education in Washington, D.C. Presidents Leila V. Moore (1991–92), Terry E. Williams (1992–93), Charles C. Schroeder (1986–87), Barbara Anderson (1994–95) and Harold E. Cheatham (1995–96) were all involved in this tremendous undertaking.

'''Early 2000''' - In 2003, Carmen Neuberger retired as Executive Director. Gregory Roberts, ACPA President from 1999–2000, was selected as the new Executive Director.

'''2010''' - The ACPA/NASPA Professional Competency Areas document was published by the Joint Task Force on Professional Competencies and Standards.

'''2011''' - After more than two years of work by the Consolidation Steering Team from ACPA and NASPA leaders, a voting process took place in March. Eighty-percent of ACPA members voted affirmed consolidation while eligible NASPA members who voted fell short of the required 2/3 majority. In the July/August 2011 issue of the Journal of Higher Education, ACPA's premier publication, THE JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT (JCSD) is ranked fourth among 50 Tier One journals in higher education. In a study by Nathaniel Bray and Claire Major, 106 out of 144 respondents reported that they read JCSD, and more than half of them cited JCSD in their work. This report continues JCSD's streak as the highest ranked journal in student affairs.

'''2012''' - ACPA appointed the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-appoints-credentialing-implementation-team Credentialing Implementation Team], launched the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-announces-institutional-leadership-councils-program Institutional Councils Program] and published its on-going [http://www2.myacpa.org/global-initiatives Global Initiatives].

Complimentary printed copies are mailed to the majority of the membership.
* ''About Campus''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090517201424/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/About-Campus/abstracts.cfm] is a bimonthly magazine for those who want to thoughtfully examine the issues, policies, and practices that influence the learning experiences of college students. Even though About Campus is sponsored by ACPA, it addresses an audience that goes well beyond student affairs to include all those on campus (administrators, faculty, and staff) who are concerned with student learning.
* ''Enough Is Enough: A Student Affairs Perspective on Preparedness and Response to a Campus Shooting'' presents first-hand accounts and experienced counsel from professionals who have lived through a violent incident, and continue to deal with its aftermath. They cover violence, suicide prevention, and mental health promotion in an integrated way, and offer a comprehensive plan to create a campus-wide system for collecting information about students at-risk for self-harm or violence toward others. Editors: Brian O. Hemphill (Northern Illinois University) and Brandi Hephner LaBanc (Northern Illinois University).
* ''Multicultural Student Services on Campus'' constitutes a thorough introduction to the structure, organization, and scope of the services and educational mission for new professionals in multicultural student services (MSS). For senior practitioners it offers insights for re-evaluating their strategies, and inspiration to explore new possibilities. The book discusses the history and philosophy of MSS units; describes their operation; asserts the need for integration and coherence across the multiple facets of their work and how their role is influenced by the character and type of their institutions; and considers the challenges and opportunities ahead. Editor: Dafina Lazarus Stewart (Bowling Green State University).
* ''Making Good On The Promise'' gets to the heart of the experience o student affairs professionals with disabilities, to the curricular changes needed in preparation programs for that profession, to the role and appropriate action needed by allies, and to resources that all can use in the education of self and others. Editors: Jeanne L. Higbee (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities) and Alice A. Mitchell (University of Maryland College Park).
* ''Shifting Paradigms in Student Affairs'' is addressed to all student affairs professionals whose primary focus is student learning. Faculty members in preparation programs, senior administrators and student development educators in residence halls, student unions or career counseling offices will use the ideas presented in different ways. Nevertheless, the book has a common purpose for all readers which is to assert the educational functions of student affairs and services, and to situate student development education solidly within the mission of colleges and universities in the United States. Editor: Jane Fried (Central Connecticut State University).
* ''Empowering Women in Higher Education and Student Affairs'' addresses the experiences and position of women students, from application to college through graduate school, and the barriers they encounter; the continuing inequalities in the rates of promotion and progression of women and other marginalized groups to positions of authority, and the gap in earnings between men and women; and pays particular attention to how race and other social markers impact such disparities, contextualizing them across all institutional types. Editors: Penny A. Pasque (University of Oklahoma), Shelley Errington Nicholson.
* ''The First Generation Student Experience'' are 14 first-person narratives – by first-generation students spanning freshman to graduate years – that help the reader get to grips with the variety of ethnic and economic categories to which they belong. The book concludes by defining 14 key issues that institutions need to address, and offers a course of action for addressing them. By Jeff Davis.
* ''College Student Death: Guidance for a Caring Campus'' is the result of many years of collaboration with more than thirty contributors. This book applies the knowledge of university personnel called upon to respond to student death on and off campus and to provide solace to family and the campus community. It also provides support to university staff in the immediacy of student death, guides the design of policy before a crisis occurs, and provide instructional considerations for faculty. Editors: Rosa Cintrón (University of Central Florida), Erin Taylor Weathers, Katherine Garlough (Oklahoma City Community College).
* ''Where You Work Matters'' offers current and future administrators a greater appreciation for the vibrancy and complexity of the student affairs profession. This volume challenges the widely held assumption that the professional practice of student affairs administration transcends the influence of [[organizational culture]]. Based on data and commentaries from more than 1,100 practitioners, this book describes how the experience of student affairs administrators varies by institutional type. The findings paint a multifaceted and integrated portrait of the profession. Author: Joan B. Hirt (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University).
* ''Job One: Experiences of New Professionals in Student Affairs''[http://members.myacpa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/store/ItemDescription.html?Action=Cart_Item_Description&amp;InvID_Web=195&amp;Template=Books%20and%20Periodicals&amp;MarketName_W=&amp;ISBN_W=&amp;Start_W=1&amp;End_W=25&amp;NumToShow=25&amp;Volume_W=&amp;Time=1028557555&amp;SessionID=1942828260mf13my5o7d9o0jv7j56k0qn1b601g3m3nbpu73nfeal3c805z9fg1x] focuses on nine narratives written by new professionals about their introduction and transitions into student affairs. It also includes four chapters co-written by senior student affairs professionals and preparation program faculty who synthesize, integrate, and theoretically interpret the new professionals' narratives. Recommendations included in the final chapter focus on re-conceptualizing graduate preparation programs and professional development events. Edited by Peter Magolda (Miami University-Oxford) and Jill Carnaghi (Washington University in St. Louis).
* ''Toward A Sustainable Future: The Role of Student Affairs in Creating Healthy Environments, Social Justice and Strong Economies'' [http://members.myacpa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/store/ItemDescription.html?Action=Cart_Item_Description&amp;InvID_Web=663&amp;Template=Books%20and%20Periodicals&amp;MarketName_W=&amp;ISBN_W=&amp;Start_W=1&amp;End_W=25&amp;NumToShow=25&amp;Volume_W=&amp;Time=1028557555&amp;SessionID=1942828260mf13my5o7d9o0jv7j56k0qn1b601g3m3nbpu73nfeal3c805z9fg1x] is a call to action for college student educators, articulating the crucial role we play in the international sustainability movement. It contains valuable information about educating self, educating students, and making institutional change as well as a listing of resources on the triple bottom line. This monograph provides compelling arguments for taking action on campus and the necessary tools to do so successfully. By ACPA Taskforce on Sustainability; Co-chairs Boyd Yarbrough (Furman University, South Carolina) and Kathleen Gardner (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville).
* ''Assessment, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) Standards: Content Standards for Student Affairs Practitioners and Scholars'' monograph is endorsed by national accrediting bodies, associations, and assessment experts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">An '''animated narrative vignette''' (ANV) is an [[instructional technology]] used to motivate and facilitate role-playing, [[problem solving]], and discussion. Teachers develop the ANVs to present in class or in online training. Students might also create them in [[experiential learning]] exercises. They provide computer animation representations of teachable situations that encourage critical thinking and may also provide an instrument for assessing attitudes and behaviors. Vignettes have been used to teach mathematics and science, management skills, problem solving, and character education.

A '''Bachelor of Business''' ('''BBus, BBus (Major)''') is a three-year undergraduate business [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] offered by traditional and newer universities from the post-Dawkins era in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dbs.ie/course/full-time-undergraduate/full-time-undergraduate-bachelor-of-business|title=Full-time Undergraduate - Bachelor of Business|website=www.dbs.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar in format and structure to a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom).

In Australia, it was traditionally awarded by former non-university tertiary institutions which include institutes of technologies, such as [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[RMIT University]] and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]]. Some former Institute of Technologies and Colleges such as Ballarat College of Advanced Education ([[University of Ballarat]]), Swinburne Institute of Technology ([[Swinburne University]]) the South Australia Institute of Technology ([[University of South Australia]]) and the Western Australia Institute of Technology ([[Curtin University of Technology]]) have renamed their Bachelor of Business programs to Bachelor of Commerce after achieving university status.

Many universities such as [[Monash University]] and the [[University of Queensland]] are offering Bachelor of Business degrees as a way to further specialise students study needs while other universities such as [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[James Cook University]], [[Griffith University]] and [[La Trobe University]] have replaced many of their traditional general Commerce programs with Business programs.  Within Australia, Bachelor of Business degrees are as common as Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Economics degrees.

In Ireland this award can also be offered as an honours degree '''B Business (Hons)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorset-college.ie/course/131/bachelor-of-business-honours-in-international-business|title=HETAC/QQI Bachelor of Business in International Business Level 8 - Dorset College Dublin|website=www.dorset-college.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further one year study than the ordinary level Bachelor degree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67550">'''Computer-supported collaborative learning''' ('''CSCL''') is a [[pedagogical]] approach where in learning takes place via social interaction using a computer or through the Internet. This kind of learning is characterized by the sharing and [[learning|construction of knowledge]] among participants using technology as their primary means of communication or as a common resource.&lt;ref name="stahl"&gt;Stahl, G., Koschmann, T., &amp; Suthers, D.

Sawyer (Ed.), [http://gerrystahl.net/cscl/CSCL_English.pdf Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences] (pp. 409-426). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  CSCL can be implemented in online and classroom learning environments and can take place synchronously or asynchronously.

The study of computer-supported collaborative learning draws on a number of academic disciplines, including [[instructional technology]], [[educational psychology]], [[sociology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[social psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hmelo-Silver, C.E. (2006). Analyzing collaborative learning: Multiple approaches to understanding processes and outcomes. Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Learning sciences, USA, 1059-1065. {{ISBN|0-8058-6174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[collaborative learning]] and [[computer-supported cooperative work|computer supported cooperative work (CSCW)]].

==History==
Interactive computing technology was primarily conceived by academics, but the use of technology in education has historically been defined by contemporary research trends. The earliest instances of software in instruction drilled students using the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] method that was popular throughout the mid-twentieth century. In the 1970s as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] gained traction with educators, designers began to envision learning technology that employed artificial intelligence models that could adapt to individual learners.&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T. (1996) CSCL: Theory and practice of an emerging paradigm Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-supported collaborative learning emerged as a strategy rich with research implications for the growing philosophies of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and [[social cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="resta"&gt;Resta, P. &amp; Laferrière, T. (2007). Technology in Support of Collaborative Learning. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 19, 65–83. {{doi|10.1007/s10648-007-9042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though studies in collaborative learning and technology took place throughout the 1980s and 90s, the earliest public workshop directly addressing CSCL was "Joint Problem Solving and [[Microcomputers]]" which took place in [[San Diego]] in 1983. Six years later in 1989, the term "computer-supported collaborative learning" was used in a [[NATO]]-sponsored workshop in [[Maratea]], Italy.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bannon"&gt;Bannon, Liam J. (1989). [http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html Issues in computer supported collaborative learning.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126144330/http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html |date=2011-01-26 }} Chapter to appear in Proceedings of NATO Advanced Workshop on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (Claire O'Malley, Editor) held in Maratea, Italy, Sept. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A biannual CSCL conference series began in 1995. At the 2002 and 2003 CSCL conferences, the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) was established to run the CSCL and ICLS conference series and the ''International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning'' (''ijCSCL'') and JLS journals.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for the Learning Sciences. (2010). [http://www.isls.org/conferences.html Conferences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061618/http://www.isls.org/conferences.html |date=2011-05-25 }}. Retrieved 10/20/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ijCSCL'' was established by the CSCL research community and ISLS. It began quarterly publication by Springer in 2006. It is peer reviewed and published both online and in print. Since 2009, it has been rated by ISI as being in the top 10% of educational research journals based on its impact factor.&lt;ref&gt;ijCSCL [http://ijCSCL.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid development of social media technologies and the increasing need of individuals to understand and use those technologies has brought researchers from many disciplines to the field of CSCL.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt; CSCL is used today in traditional and online schools and knowledge-building communities such as [[Wikipedia]].

==Theories==
The field of CSCL draws heavily from a number of learning theories that emphasize that knowledge is the result of learners interacting with each other, sharing knowledge, and building knowledge as a group.  Since the field focuses on collaborative activity and collaborative learning, it inherently takes much from constructivist and social cognitivist learning theories.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Precursor theories===
The roots of collaborative epistemology as related to CSCL can be found in [[Vygotsky]]'s social learning theory. Of particular importance to CSCL is the theory's notion of internalization, or the idea that knowledge is developed by one's interaction with one's surrounding culture and society.  The second key element is what Vygotsky called the [[Zone of proximal development]]. This refers to a range of tasks that can be too difficult for a learner to master by themselves but is made possible with the assistance of a more skilled individual or teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Kearsley, G. (13 Oct 10). [http://icebreakerideas.com/learning-theories/ The Theory Into Practice Database].&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas feed into a notion central to CSCL: knowledge building is achieved through interaction with others.

[[Cooperative learning]], though different in some ways from collaborative learning, also contributes to the success of teams in CSCL environments. The distinction can be stated as: cooperative learning focuses on the effects of group interaction on individual learning whereas collaborative learning is more concerned with the cognitive processes at the group unit of analysis such as shared meaning making and the joint problem space. The five elements for effective cooperative groups identified by the work of Johnson and Johnson are positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, [[social skills]], and group processing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., &amp; Holubec, E. (2002). Circles of learning: Cooperation in the classroom. Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company, p. 95-118, {{ISBN|0-939603-12-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inherent relationship between cooperation and collaboration, understanding what encourages successful cooperation is essential to CSCL research.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter wrote seminal articles leading to the development of key CSCL concepts: knowledge-building communities and knowledge-building discourse, intentional learning, and expert processes. Their work led to an early collaboration-enabling technology known as the Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE).&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia, M. &amp; Bereiter, C. (1994). Computer support for knowledge building communities. The Journal of the Learning Sciences. 3(3), 265-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically for CSCL, their theories were integrated with the design, deployment, and study of the CSCL technology. CSILE later became Knowledge Forum, which is the most widely used CSCL technology worldwide to date.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Other learning theories that provide a foundation for CSCL include [[distributed cognition]], [[problem-based learning]], [[group cognition]], cognitive apprenticeship, and situated learning.  Each of these learning theories focuses on the social aspect of learning and knowledge building, and recognizes that learning and knowledge building involve inter-personal activities including conversation, argument, and negotiation.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Collaboration theory and [[group cognition]]===
Only in the last 15 to 20 years have researchers begun to explore the extent to which computer technology could enhance the collaborative learning process.  While researchers, in general, have relied on learning theories developed without consideration of computer-support, some have suggested that the field needs to have a theory tailored and refined for the unique challenges that confront those trying to understand the complex interplay of technology and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="collab"&gt;Stahl, G. (2002). Contributions to a theoretical framework for CSCL. In G. Stahl (Ed.), Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community. Proceedings of CSCL 2002 (pp. 62-71). Boulder, CO: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaboration theory, suggested as a system of analysis for CSCL by [[Gerry Stahl]] in 2002-2006, postulates that knowledge is constructed in social interactions such as discourse. The theory suggests that learning is not a matter of accepting fixed facts, but is the dynamic, on-going, and evolving result of complex interactions primarily taking place within communities of people. It also emphasizes that collaborative learning is a process of constructing meaning and that meaning creation most often takes place and can be observed at the group unit of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. (2004). [http://GerryStahl.net/cscl/papers/ch16.pdf Building collaborative knowing: Elements of a social theory of CSCL.] In J.-W. Strijbos, P. Kirschner &amp; R. Martens (Eds.), What we know about CSCL: And implementing it in higher education (pp. 53-86). Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of collaboration theory is to develop an understanding of how meaning is collaboratively constructed, preserved, and re-learned through the media of language and artifacts in group interaction. There are four crucial themes in collaboration theory: collaborative knowledge building (which is seen as a more concrete term than "learning"); group and personal perspectives intertwining to create group understanding; mediation by artifacts (or the use of resources which learners can share or imprint meaning on); and interaction analysis using captured examples that can be analyzed as proof that the knowledge building occurred.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Collaboration theory proposes that technology in support of CSCL should provide new types of media that foster the building of collaborative knowing; facilitate the comparison of knowledge built by different types and sizes of groups; and help collaborative groups with the act of negotiating the knowledge they are building. Further, these technologies and designs should strive to remove the teacher as the bottleneck in the communication process.  In other words, the teacher should not have to act as the conduit for communication between students or as the avenue by which information is dispensed.  Finally, collaboration theory-influenced technologies will strive to increase the quantity and quality of learning moments via computer-simulated situations.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Stahl extended his proposals about collaboration theory during the next decade with his research on [[group cognition]] [http://GerryStahl.net/elibrary]. In his book on "Group Cognition",&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;Stahl, G. (2006). Group Cognition: Computer support for building collaborative knowledge. Cambridge:MA. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he provided a number of case studies of prototypes of collaboration technology, as well as a sample in-depth interaction analysis and several essays on theoretical issues related to re-conceptualizing cognition at the small-group unit of analysis. He then launched the [[Virtual Math Teams]] project at the Math Forum, which conducted more than 10 years of studies of students exploring mathematical topics collaboratively online. "Studying VMT"&lt;ref name="SVMT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2009). Studying Virtual Math Teams. New York:NY. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; documented many issues of design, analysis and theory related to this project. The VMT later focused on supporting dynamic geometry by integrating a multi-user version of GeoGebra. All aspects of this phase of the VMT project were described in "Translating Euclid."&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;Stahl, G. (2013). Translating Euclid: Creating a Human-Centered Mathematics. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, "Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together"&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2016). Constructing dynamic triangles together: The development of mathematical group cognition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a detailed analysis of how a group of four girls learned about dynamic geometry by enacting a series of group practices during an eight-session longitudinal case study. The VMT project generated and analyzed data at the small-group unit of analysis, to substantiate and refine the theory of group cognition and to offer a model of design-based CSCL research.

==Strategies==
Currently, CSCL is used in instructional plans in classrooms both traditional and online from primary school to post-graduate institutions. Like any other instructional activity, it has its own prescribed practices and strategies which educators are encouraged to employ in order to use it effectively. Because its use is so widespread, there are innumerable scenarios in the use of CSCL, but there are several common strategies that provide a foundation for group cognition.

One of the most common approaches to CSCL is [[collaborative writing]]. Though the final product can be anything from a research paper, a Wikipedia entry, or a short story, the process of planning and writing together encourages students to express their ideas and develop a group understanding of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Heimbuch, S., &amp; Bodemer, D. (2015). Let's Talk about Talks: Supporting Knowledge Exchange Processes on Wiki Discussion Pages. In ''AAAI Technical Report on Wikipedia, a Social Pedia: Research Challenges and Opportunities (ICWSM-15)'' (Vol. WS-15-19), 56–61. Palo Alto, USA: AAAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools like [[blogs]], [[interactive whiteboards]], and custom spaces that combine free writing with communication tools can be used to share work, form ideas, and write synchronously.&lt;ref&gt;Onrubia, J. &amp; Engel, A. (2009). Strategies for Collaborative Writing and Phases of Knowledge Construction in CSCL Environments. Computers &amp; Education, 53(4), 1256-1265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikis"&gt;Larusson, J., &amp; Alterman, R. (2009). Wikis to support the "collaborative" part of collaborative learning. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(4), 371-402. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-009-9076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology-mediated discourse refers to debates, discussions, and other social learning techniques involving the examination of a theme using technology. For example, wikis are a way to encourage discussion among learners, but other common tools include mind maps, survey systems, and simple message boards. Like collaborative writing, technology-mediated discourse allows participants that may be separated by time and distance to engage in conversations and build knowledge together.&lt;ref name="wikis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asterhan, C., &amp; Schwarz, B. (2010). Online moderation of synchronous e-argumentation. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 259-82. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exploration refers to the shared discovery of a place, activity, environment or topic among two or more people. Students do their exploring in an online environment, use technology to better understand a physical area, or reflect on their experiences together through the Internet. [[Virtual worlds]] like [[Second Life]] and [[Whyville]] as well as synchronous communication tools like [[Skype]] may be used for this kind of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, B., &amp; Ketelhut, D. (2008). Exploring embedded guidance and self-efficacy in educational multi-user virtual environments. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(4), 413-27. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioannidou, A., Repenning, A., Webb, D., Keyser, D., Luhn, L., &amp; Daetwyler, C. (2010). Mr. Vetro: A Collective Simulation for teaching health science. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(2), 141-66. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9082-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem-based learning is a popular instructional activity that lends itself well to CSCL because of the social implications of problem solving. Complex problems call for rich group interplay that encourages collaboration and creates movement toward a clear goal.&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;Lu, J., Lajoie, S., &amp; Wiseman, J. (2010). Scaffolding problem-based learning with CSCL tools. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 283-98. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T., Feltovich, P., Myers, A., &amp; Barrows, H. (1992). Implications of CSCL for problem-based learning:Special issue on computer supported collaborative learning. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(3), 32-35. {{doi|10.1145/130893.130902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project-based learning]] is similar to problem-based learning in that it creates impetus to establish team roles and set goals. The need for collaboration is also essential for any project and encourages team members to build experience and knowledge together. Although there are many advantages to using software that has been specifically developed to support collaborative learning or project-based learning in a particular domain, any  file sharing or communication tools can be used to facilitate CSCL in problem- or project-based environments.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld, P., Soloway, E., Marx, R., Krajcik, J., Guzdial, M., &amp; Palincsar, A. (1991). Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning. Educational Psychologist, 26(3/4), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Web 2.0]] applications  (wikies,  blogs,  RSS  feed,  collaborative  writing,  video  sharing,  social  networks, etc.) are used for computer-supported collaborative learning specific strategies should be used for their implementation, especially regarding (1) adoption by teachers and students; (2) usability and quality in use issues; (3) technology maintenance; (4) pedagogy and instructional design; (5) social interaction between students; (6) privacy issues; and (7) information/system security.&lt;ref&gt;Bubas, G., Orehovacki, T., Coric, A. (2011). Strategies for implementation of Web 2.0 tools in academic education [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307915719_Strategies_for_implementation_of_Web_20_tools_in_academic_education]. 17th European University Information Systems International Congress, EUNIS 2011, Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher roles==

Though the focus in CSCL is on individuals collaborating with their peers, teachers still have a vital role in facilitating learning. Most obviously, the instructor must introduce the CSCL activity in a thoughtful way that contributes to an overarching design plan for the course. The design should clearly define the learning outcomes and [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessments]] for the activity. In order to assure that learners are aware of these objectives and that they are eventually met, proper administration of both resources and expectations is necessary to avoid learner overload. Once the activity has begun, the teacher is charged with kick-starting and monitoring discussion to facilitate learning. He or she must also be able to mitigate technical issues for the class. Lastly, the instructor must engage in [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessment]], in whatever form the design calls for, in order to ensure objectives have been met for all students.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, P (2008). [http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf Competencies for online instructors.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703164002/http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }} Learning Peaks, Retrieved October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the proper structure, any CSCL strategy can lose its effectiveness. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make students aware of what their goals are, how they should be interacting, potential technological concerns, and the time-frame for the exercise. This framework should enhance the experience for learners by supporting collaboration and creating opportunities for the construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kobbe, L., Weinberger, A., Dillenbourg, P., Harrer, A., Hämäläinen, R., Häkkinen, P. &amp; Fischer, F. (2007) Specifying computer-supported collaboration scripts.  International Journal of Computer Supported Learning,  2(2-3), 211-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoonenboom, J. (2008). The effect of a script and a structured interface in grounding discussions. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(3), 327-41. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important consideration of educators who implement online learning environments is [[affordance]]. Students who are already comfortable with online communication often choose to interact casually. Mediators should pay special attention to make students aware of their expectations for formality online.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. &amp; Hesse, F. (2009).  [http://ijcscl.org/?go=contents&amp;article=77#article77  Practice perspectives in CSCL.] International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(2), pp. 109-114&lt;/ref&gt;  While students sometime have frames of reference for online communication, they often do not have all of the skills necessary to solve problems by themselves. Ideally, teachers provide what is called "scaffolding", a platform of knowledge that they can build on. A unique benefit of CSCL is that, given proper teacher facilitation, students can use technology to build learning foundations with their peers. This allows instructors to gauge the difficulty of the tasks presented and make informed decisions about the extent of the scaffolding needed.&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt;

==Effects==
According to Salomon (1995), the possibility of intellectual partnerships with both peers and advanced information technology has changed the criteria for what is counted to be the effects of technology. Instead of only concentrating on the amount and quality of learning outcomes, we need to distinguish between two kinds of effects: that is, "effects with a tool and/or collaborating peers, and effects of these." He used the term called "effects with" which is to describe the changes that take place while one is engaged in intellectual partnership with peers or with a computer tool. For example, the changed quality of problem solving in a team. And he means the word "effects of" more lasting changes that take place when computer-enhanced collaboration teaches students to ask more exact and explicit questions even when not using that system.

===Applications===
It has a number of implications for instructional designers, developers, and teachers.
*First, it revealed what technological features or functions were particularly important and useful to students in the context of writing, and how a CSCL system could be adapted for use for different subject areas, which have specific implications for instructional designers or developers to consider when designing CSCL tools.
*Second, this study also suggested the important role of a teacher in designing the scaffolds, scaffolding the collaborative learning process, and making CSCL a success. Third, it is important that a meaningful, real-world task is designed for CSCL in order to engage students in authentic learning activities of knowledge construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Opinnot/T-110.556/2003/Materiaali/EditedLehtinenCSCL.pdf|contribution=COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING: AN APPROACH TO POWERFUL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS|author=Erno Lehtinen|editors=E. De Corte, L. Verschaffel, N. Entwistle &amp; J. Van Merriëboer|title=Unravelling basic components and dimensions of powerful learning environments|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, cooperative work in the classroom, using as a tool based technology devices "one to one " where the teacher has a program of classroom management, allows not only the enhancement of teamwork where each member takes responsibilities involving the group, but also a personalized and individualized instruction, adapting to the rhythms of the students, and allowing to achieve the targets set in which has been proposed for them individualized Work Plan.

==Criticism and concerns==
Though CSCL holds promise for enhancing education, it is not without barriers or challenges to successful implementation. Obviously, students or participants need sufficient access to computer technology. Though access to computers has improved in the last 15 to 20 years, teacher attitudes about technology and sufficient access to Internet-connected computers continue to be barriers to more widespread usage of CSCL pedagogy.

Furthermore, instructors find that the time needed to monitor student discourse and review, comment on, and grade student products can be more demanding than what is necessary for traditional face-to-face classrooms. The teacher or professor also has an instructional decision to make regarding the complexity of the problem presented. To warrant collaborative work, the problem must be of sufficient complexity, otherwise teamwork is unnecessary. Also, there is risk in assuming that students instinctively know how to work collaboratively. Though the task may be collaborative by nature, students may still need training on how to work in a truly cooperative process.

Others have noted a concern with the concept of scripting as it pertains to CSCL. There is an issue with possibly over-scripting the CSCL experience and in so doing, creating "fake collaboration".  Such over-scripted collaboration may fail to trigger the social, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that are necessary to true collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="bannon" /&gt;

There is also the concern that the mere availability of the technology tools can create problems. Instructors may be tempted to apply technology to a learning activity that can very adequately be handled without the intervention or support of computers. In the process of students and teachers learning how to use the "user-friendly" technology, they never get to the act of collaboration. As a result, computers become an obstacle to collaboration rather than a supporter of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dillenbourg, P. (2002). [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00190230/fr/ Over-scripting CSCL: The risks of blending collaborative learning with instructional design.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== For second language acquisition ==

=== History ===
The advent of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) as an instructional strategy for [[second language acquisition]] can be traced back to the 1990s. During that time, the internet was growing rapidly, which was one of the key factors that facilitated the process.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. ''The Modern Language Journal, 81''(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the first [[wikis]] (such as [[WikiWikiWeb]]) were still undergoing early development,&lt;ref&gt;Ebersbach, Anja (2008), Wiki: Web Collaboration, Springer Science+Business Media, {{ISBN|3-540-35150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of other tools such as electronic discussion groups allowed for equal participation amongst peers, particularly benefiting those who would normally not participate otherwise during face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. The Modern Language Journal, 81(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the establishment of wikis in the 2000s, global research began to emerge regarding their effectiveness in promoting second language acquisition. Some of this research focused on more specific areas such as [[systemic-functional linguistics]], [[humanistic education]], [[experiental learning]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. For example, in 2009 Yu-Ching Chen performed a study to determine the overall effectiveness of wikis in an English as a second language class in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y. (2009). The effect of applying wikis in an English as a foreign language (EFL) class in Taiwan. Dissertation Abstracts International, A: The Humanities and Social Sciences, 69(11), 4300.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a 2009 study by Greg Kessler in which pre-service, non-native English speaker teachers in a Mexican university were given the task to collaborate on a wiki, which served as the final product for one of their courses. In this study, emphasis was placed on the level of grammatical accuracy achieved by the students throughout the course of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, G. (2009). Student-Initiated Attention to Form in Wiki-Based Collaborative Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 13(1), 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the continual development of technology, other educational tools aside from wikis are being implemented and studied to determine their potential in scaffolding second language acquisition. According to Mark Warschauer (2010), among these are blogs, automated writing evaluation systems, and open-source netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2010). Invited Commentary: New Tools For Teaching Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 14(1), 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ex situ'' of the classroom, the development of other recent online tools such as [[Livemocha]] (2007) have facilitated language acquisition via member-to-member interactions,&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Clint (Spring 2010). "Livemocha and the Power of Social Language Learning". IH Journal of Education and Development (28).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating firsthand the impact the advancement of technology has made towards meeting the varying needs of language learners.

=== Effectiveness and perception ===

Studies in the field of [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) have shown that computers provide material and valuable feedback for language learners and that computers can be a positive tool for both individual and collaborative language learning. CALL programs offer the potential for interactions between the language learners and the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2003). English language learning and technology. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, students' [[autonomous language learning]] and [[self-assessment]] can be made widely available through the web.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2001). Computer applications in second language acquisition: Foundations for teaching, testing and research. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In CSCL, the computer is not only seen as a potential language tutor by providing assessment for students' responses,&lt;ref&gt;Levy, M. (1997). CALL: Context and conceptualisation. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a tool to give language learners the opportunity to learn from the computer and also via collaboration with other language learners. Juan&lt;ref&gt;Juan, A. A., 1972. (2010). Monitoring and assessment in online collaborative environments: Emergent computational technologies for e-learning support. Hershey, PA: Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on new models and systems that perform efficient evaluation of student activity in online-based education. Their findings indicate that CSCL environments organized by teachers are useful for students to develop their language skills. Additionally, CSCL increases students' confidence and encourages them to maintain active learning, reducing the passive reliance on teachers' feedback. Using CSCL as a tool in the second language learning classroom has also shown to reduce [[learner anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, S. (2007). Anxiety and non-anxiety in a distance language learning environment: The distance factors as a modifying influence. System, 35(4), 487-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various case studies and projects had been conducted in order to measure the effectiveness and perception of CSCL in a language learning classroom. After a collaborative internet-based project, language learners indicated that their confidence in using the language had increased and that they felt more motivated to learn and use the target language. After analyzing student questionnaires, discussion board entries, final project reports, and student journals, Dooly&lt;ref&gt;Dooly, M. (2007). Joining forces: Promoting metalinguistic awareness through computer-supported collaborative learning. Language Awareness, 16(1), 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that during computer supported collaborative language learning, students have an increased awareness of different aspects of the target language and pay increased attention to their own language learning process. Since the participants of her project were language teacher trainees, she adds that they felt prepared and willing to incorporate online interaction in their own teaching in the future.

=== Cultural considerations ===

[[Culture]] may be thought of as composed of "beliefs, norms, assumptions, knowledge, values, or sets of practice that are shared and form a system".&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, N. (2014). Social and cultural anthropology: The key concepts. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning communities]] focused in whole or part on second language acquisition may often be distinctly multicultural in composition, and as the cultural background of individual learners affects their collaborative norms and practices, this can significantly impact their ability to learn in a CSCL environment.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Anastasios A. Economides. (2008). Culture‐aware collaborative learning. Multicultural Education &amp; Technology Journal, 2(4), 243–267.  http://doi.org/10.1108/17504970810911052&lt;/ref&gt;

CSCL environments are generally valued for the potential to promote collaboration in cross-cultural learning communities. Based on [[social constructivist]] views of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes.&lt;/ref&gt; many CSCL environments fundamentally emphasize learning as the co-construction of knowledge through the computer-mediated interaction of multivoiced community members. Computer-mediation of the learning process has been found to afford consideration of alternative viewpoints in multicultural/multilingual learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atsumi, T., Misumi, J., Smith, P., Peter, B., Peterson, M., Tayeb, M., … Tanzer, N. (1989). Groups, leadership and social influence. Recent Advances in Social Psychology: An  International Perspective, 369–428.&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to traditional face-to-face environments, computer-mediated learning environments have been shown to result in more equal levels of participation for ESL students in courses with native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2005). Comparing face-to-face and electronic discussion in the second language classroom. CALICO Journal, 13(2-3), 7–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Language barriers for non-native speakers tend to detract from equal participation in general,&lt;ref&gt;Gunawardena, C. N., Nolla, A. C., Wilson, P. L., Lopez‐Islas, J. R., Ramirez‐Angel, N., &amp; Megchun‐Alpizar, R. M. (2001). A cross‐cultural study of group process and development in online conferences. Distance Education, 22(1), 85–121.&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be alleviated to some extent through the use of technologies which support asynchronous modes of written communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ku, H.-Y., &amp; Lohr, L. L. (2003). A case study of Chinese student's attitudes toward their first online learning experience. Educational Technology Research and  Development, 51(3), 95–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Online learning environments however tend to reflect the cultural, [[epistemological]], and [[pedagogical]] goals and assumptions of their designers.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.php/AJET/article/view/1822&lt;/ref&gt; In computer-supported collaborative learning environments, there is evidence that cultural background may impact learner motivation, attitude towards learning and e-learning, learning preference (style), computer usage, learning behavior and strategies, academic achievement, communication, participation, knowledge transfer, sharing and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Studies variously comparing Asian, American and Danish and Finnish learners have suggested that learners from different cultures exhibit different interaction patterns with their peers and teachers in online.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K.-J., &amp; Bonk, C. J. (2002). Cross-cultural Comparisons of Online Collaboration. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 8(1), 0–0.  http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00163.x&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have shown that difference in Eastern and Western educational cultures, for instance, which are found in traditional environments are also present in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, A., &amp; McQueen, R. J. (1999). Computer assisted adult interactive learning in a multi-cultural environment. Adult Learning, 11(1), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, L., &amp; Ku, H. (2005). Chinese graduate students' experiences and attitudes toward online learning. Educational Media International, 42(1), 33–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J. (2007). A cultural look at information and communication technologies in Eastern education. Educational Technology Research and Development, 55(3), 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt; has described Eastern education as more group-based, teacher-dominated, centrally organized, and examination-oriented than Western approaches. Students who have learned to learn in an Eastern context emphasizing teacher authority and standardized examinations may perform differently in a CSCL environment characterized by [[peer critique]] and co-construction of [[educational artifacts]] as the primary mode of assessment.

==== Design implications ====
A "multiple cultural model" of [[instructional design]] emphasizes variability and flexibility in the process of designing for multicultural inclusiveness, focusing on the development of learning environments reflecting the multicultural realities of society, include multiple ways of teaching and learning, and promote equity of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1994). Reeves' pedagogic model of interactive learning systems and cultural contextuality (pp. 189–203). Presented at the Proceedings of the second  international interactive multimedia symposium, Promaco Conventions Pty. Ltd. Perth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1996). Instructional design of interactive multimedia: A cultural critique. Educational Technology Research and Development, 44(4), 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; McLoughlin, C. &amp; Oliver&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a social, constructivist approach to the design of culturally-sensitive CSCL environments which emphasizes flexibility with regard to specific learning tasks, tools, roles, responsibilities, communication strategies, social interactions, learning goals and modes of assessment [B5]. Constructivist instructional design approaches such as R2D2&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J. (1995). A Recursive, Reflective Instructional Design Model Based on Constructivist-Interpretivist Theory. Educational Technology, 35(6), 5–23.&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasize reflexive, recursive, [[participatory design]] of learning experiences may be employed in developing CSCL which authentically engages learners from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

== Dyslexia in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning ==

=== History ===
[[Dyslexia]] primarily involves difficulties with reading, spelling and sentence structure, transposition, memory, organization and time management, and lack of confidence.&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"&gt;Woodfine, et. al. (2006). Text-based synchronous e-learning and dyslexia: Not necessarily the perfect match!. Science Direct, 703-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia has in the past two decades become increasingly present in research and legislation. The United Kingdom passed the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] in which institutions were required to “reasonably adjust” instruction for students with disabilities, particularly physical and sensory disabilities; in 2002, the [[Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001|Special Education Needs and Disabilities Act]] adjusted the legislation to include learning disabilities.
 
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) established that all students with disabilities must be included in all state and districtwide assessments of student progress. The ADA also guarantees equal accommodation for the disabled in, “employment, public accommodations, state and local government services, transportation, and telecommunications.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In recent years, tools such as WebHelpDyslexia and other capabilities of web applications have increased the availability of tools to provide coping skills for students with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;Avelar, L. O., Rezende, G. C., &amp; Friere, A. P. (2015). WebHelpDyslexia: a browser extension to adapt web content for people with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 67, 150-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on Dyslexia in E-Learning Environments ===
In 2006, Woodfine argued that dyslexia can impact the ability of a student to participate in synchronous e-learning environments, especially if activities being completed are text-based. During experimental qualitative research, Woodfine found that data suggested “learners with dyslexia might suffer from embarrassment, shame and even guilt about their ability to interact with other learners when in a synchronous environment.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In a study by Fichten et al., it was found that assistive technology can be beneficial in aiding students with the progression of their reading and writing skills. Tools such as spell check or text-to-speech can be helpful to learners with dyslexia by allowing them to focus more on self-expression and less on errors.&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). Personalised learning materials based on dyslexia types: ontological approach.Procedia Computer Science, 60, 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design implications ===

Alsobhi, et al., examined assistive technologies for dyslexic students and concluded that the most fundamental considerations to be had when serving students of this population are: “the learning styles that people with dyslexia exhibit, and how [[assistive technology]] can be adapted to align with these learning behaviors.”&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"/&gt;
 
The [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915012673 Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning] (DAEL) is a suggested a framework that proposes four dimensions that cover 26 attributes. The proposed framework asks educators to make decisions based on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system adaptability:
*perceived ease of use: This refers to the degree to which a student believes that using the technology is free of effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). DAEL framework: a new adaptive e-learnng framework for students with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 51, 1947-1956.&lt;/ref&gt; One technique to increase the perceived ease of use includes utilizing technology in which self-descriptiveness is present. This, coupled with clarity and logical flow of functions, makes the learning process easier and the interaction between the user and machine more convenient.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*perceived usefulness: Defined as how a student's performance, or learning performance, can be enhanced by a system. Studies show the impact of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and their role in a users’ decision on whether to use a system again. Scaffolding as well as accommodations to the student's learning style will help overcome limitations of system operations, as will feedback geared toward system improvements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*system adaptability: Refers to the user experiences and the way in which students are given control over a system to increase confidence and comfort in their learning. In addition to implications for the system, the flow of content shouldb be logical and the tone (attitude) of content should be encouraging.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== 508 Compliance &amp; the implications for Educators ===
Educators that choose to use the CSCL environment must be aware of [https://www.section508.gov/content/learn 508 compliance] and its legal implications. “In the U.S., the criteria for designing Web pages accessibly are provided by two major sets: the W3C’s [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|Web Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) and the design standards issued under U.S. federal law, [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973|Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act]], as amended in 1998.1 Features of accessible design include, among others, the provision of ALT tags for nontextual elements, such as images, animations and image map hot spots; meaningful link text; logical and persistent page organization, and the inclusion of skip navigation links."&lt;ref&gt;Axel Schmetzke &amp; David Comeaux (2009) Accessibility Trends among Academic Library and Library School Web Sites in the USA and Canada, Journal of Access Services, 6:1-2, 137-152, DOI: 10.1080/15367960802286286&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately, not all educators are exposed to these guidelines, especially if their collegiate programs do not provide exposure to the use of computers, aspects of web design or technology in education. In some cases, it may be advantageous for the educator to collaborate with an instructional technologist or web designer to ensure 508 guidelines are addressed in the desired learning environment for the CSCL.

== Web 3.0 and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) ==
The [[World Wide Web]] began as information sharing on [[Static web page|static webpages]] accessible on a computer through the use of a [[web browser]]. As more interactive capabilities were added, it evolved into [[Web 2.0]], which allowed for [[user-generated content]] and participation (e.g. [[Social networking service|social networking]]). This opened up many new possibilities for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) using the Internet. The internet is now entering a new phase, [[Web 3.0]] or the [[Semantic Web]], which is characterized by the greater [[interconnectivity]] of [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] data from many different sources.

The interconnectivity of machine-readable data with semantic tags means that searches will be greatly enhanced. Search results will be more relevant, recommendations of resources will be made based on search terms and results will include [[multimedia]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Mark|last2=Kendrick|first2=Lynn Marie|date=2015-12-01|title=Toward Education 3.0: Pedagogical Affordances and Implications of Social Software and the Semantic Web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tl.20167/abstract|journal=New Directions for Teaching and Learning|language=en|volume=2015|issue=144|pages=109–119|doi=10.1002/tl.20167|issn=1536-0768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robin D.|date=2011-01-01|title=Web 3.0: Implications for Online Learning|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|journal=TechTrends|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–46|doi=10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|issn=8756-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halimi|first=Khaled|last2=Seridi-Bouchelaghem|first2=Hassina|date=2015-01-01|title=Semantic web based learning styles identification for social learning environments personalization|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;doi=10.3233/WEB-150307|journal=Web Intelligence|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–29|doi=10.3233/web-150307|issn=2405-6456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Web 3.0 capabilities for learners include enhanced tools for managing learning, allowing them to [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulate]] and [[Co-regulation|co-regulate]] learning without the assistance of an instructor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Through the use of Web 3.0, groups and communities can be formed according to specific criteria without human input. These communities and groups can provide support to new learners and give experts an opportunity to share their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Teachers can benefit from these same capabilities to manage their teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Ali|date=2002|title=Conceptualizing Intelligent Agents for Learning and Teaching|url=https://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm0235.pdf|journal=Educause Quarterly|volume=25 |issue=3|pages=28–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the software for Web 3.0 collaboration will include using data from group communications, which then generates how much each individual has collaborated based on how often they communicate and how long their messages are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Heisawn|last2=Hmelo-Silver|first2=Cindy E.|date=2016-04-02|title=Seven Affordances of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: How to Support Collaborative Learning?

=== Examples of new Web 3.0 tools to enhance CSCL ===

==== Virtual Assistants and Intelligent Agents  ====
Making data machine-readable is leading to the development of [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistants]] and [[intelligent agent]]s. These are tools which can access data on a user's behalf and will be able to assist learners and collaborators in several ways. They can provide personalized and customized search results by accessing data on a variety of platforms, recommend resources based on user information and preferences, manage administrative tasks, communicate with other agents and databases, and help organize information and interactions with collaborators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riaan Rudman|last2=Rikus Bruwer|date=2016-01-20|title=Defining Web 3.0: opportunities and challenges|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/EL-08-2014-0140|journal=The Electronic Library|volume=34|issue=1|pages=132–154|doi=10.1108/el-08-2014-0140|issn=0264-0473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Virtual Learning Communities  ====
Virtual learning communities are [[cyberspace]]s that allow for individual and [[collaborative learning]] to take place. While they exist today, with Web 3.0 they will gain enhanced features enabling more collaborative learning to take place. Some describe them as evolving out of existing [[learning management system]]s (LMSs), adding intelligent agents and virtual assistants that can enhance content searches and deal with administrative and communication tasks,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or enabling different LMSs around the world to communicate with each other, creating an even larger community to share resources and locate potential collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribón|first=Julio César Rodríguez|last2=Villalba|first2=Luis Javier García|last3=Kim|first3=Tai-hoon|date=2015-10-01|title=Virtual learning communities: unsolved troubles|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|language=en|volume=74|issue=19|pages=8505–8519|doi=10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|issn=1380-7501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual learning communities will also enable different types of peer-to-peer interaction and resource sharing to support co-construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Stephen J.H.|date=2006|title=Context Aware Ubiquitous Learning Environments for Peer-to-Peer Collaborative Learning|jstor=jeductechsoci.9.1.188|journal=Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society|volume=9|issue=1|pages=188–201|doi=10.2307/jeductechsoci.9.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities may also include some aspects of 3D gaming and VR.

==== Non-immersive and Immersive 3D Virtual Environments ====
Through the use of [[3D game graphics|3D gaming]], users can simulate lives of others while providing their knowledge throughout the 3D environment as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. These 3D environments also foster [[simulation]] and scenario building&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for places where users would otherwise not have access. The 3D environments facilitate online knowledge building communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Web 3.0 in education {{!}} Editură acreditată CNCSIS, Editura Universitară|url=http://www.editurauniversitara.ro/carte/education/web_30_in_education/10419|doi=10.5682/2066-026x-12-073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-immersive environments are environments in which not all five senses are used but still allows users to interact in virtual worlds.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Randolph L.|last2=Fagan|first2=Eileen|date=2000|title=Collaboration and Learning Within Immersive Virtual Reality|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/351006.351018|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Collaborative Virtual Environments|series=CVE '00|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=83–92|doi=10.1145/351006.351018|isbn=1581133030}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality headset|Virtual Reality (VR) headsets]] are sometimes used to give users a full immersion experience, into these 3D virtual worlds. This allows users to interact with each other in real time and simulate different learning situations with other users. These learning experiences and environments vary between fields and learning goals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Certain virtual reality headsets allow users to communicate with each other while being in different physical locations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Multimodal literacy development in CSCL ==

=== The concept of Multimodal literacy ===

Multimodal literacy is the way processes of literacy - reading, writing, talking, listening and viewing - are occurring within and around new communication media. (Kress &amp; Jewitt, 2003; Pahl &amp; Rowsell, 2005; Walsh, 2008) It refers to meaning-making that occurs through the reading, viewing, understanding, responding to and producing and interacting with multimedia and digital texts. (Walsh, 2010)

=== Literature review on multi-modal literacy in CSCL ===
==== * Online forum  ====

Online forums offer numerous advantages for both teacher and students for collaborative learning online. Discussion forums provide a wider platform to exchange information and ideas, to develop writing and reading skills, critical thinking skills. (Jill Margerison, 2013) A collaborative online forum can also help students learn about the unique challenges of online communication, especially the need for clarity and the dangers of sarcasm. (Susan Martens-Baker, 2009) For the teacher, they offer a flexible platform from which to educate in a participatory culture, where teachers and students can interact with each other and create new knowledge. (Jill Margerison, 2013)

==== * Video games ====
Video games were designed as a learning tool engaged learners who advance through experimentation, critical thinking and practice in the virtual world. (Abrams, 2009) Video games in CSCL can promote positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face promotive interaction, social skills, and group processing abilities in the ELA classroom. Through interactions in the virtual world, learners have the opportunities to establish their presence, identity and create meanings for their lives.

==== * Multimodal composition in digital storytelling: podcast, video/ audio crafts ====
Digital storytelling refers to integrating a variety of means, such as images, audio, video, graphics and diagram to personal narratives and crafts. Four skill competencies: reading, writing, speaking, and listening would be enhanced by producing digital products. (Brenner, 2014) Students have a greater sense of autonomy, agency through the digital storytelling in CSCL.

=== The implication for classroom teaching ===

==== * Online-forum ====
Online forums provide opportunities for young people to engage in the self-exposition as they practice digital literacies and hone the skill of movement across multiple literacies, languages and subject positions. Meanwhile, identity is a constellation of the multiple communities. It is also important to emphasize the potentially harmful cultural discourses that occur within young people's consumption. (Kim, 2015)

==== * Videogame ====
Through capitalizing on students’ gaming experiences by recognizing how they apply to the subject at hand, teachers can highlight the benefits of virtual learning environments and draw upon students’ gaming experiences to understand their application of virtual learning across curricula. Educators need to choose the appropriate game for the particular subject to endorse their instruction and promote collaboration among students.

==== Multimodal composition: podcast, audio, video crafts in digital storytelling ====
Students who engage in collaborative learning for creating digital production show the characteristics of leadership. Moreover, students would gain the experience of collaboration and expand their skill of the multimodal literacy. In addition, digital composition provides a meaningful tool for teachers to assess. (Brenner, 2014)

=== Applications for ELLs ===

Multimodal literacy can facilitate English learners’ literacy learning. It has provided opportunities for English learners to expand the interpretation of texts. (Ajayi, 2009)  Specifically, English language learners can increase their language ability through computer-collaborative learning. 
The multimodality platforms provide students, especially ELLs with an anxiety-free zone to collaborate with their peers in a virtual world in order to make meanings together. Technology self-efficacy increases ELLs’ level of independence and reduces their level of anxiety. (Mellati, Zangoei &amp; Khademi, 2015) ELLs will have more motivation and self-confident while participating in online group projects to make contributions and share knowledge with their peers. As a result of collaborative learning,  ELLs would expand their vocabulary, gain advanced and more academic grammars.

== CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ==

=== Overview of CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===

====Research on CSCL in post-secondary education settings====
The applications of CSCL in post-secondary education demonstrate positive impacts on students’ learning such as promoting learner interaction, motivation and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang, N., Ghislandi, P., &amp; Dellantonio, S|first=|date=2018|title=Online collaboration in a large university class supports quality teaching|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-017-9564-8|journal=Education Tech Research Dev|volume=66|pages=671–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As collaborative learning is grounded in social constructivism, the interaction and collaboration during learning is valued.

==== Developing Professional Skills ====
There's research findings that shows online students had higher scores than face-to-face students in professional competence acquisition test, showing the effectiveness of CSCL in promoting the development of professional skills&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francescato, D., Mebane, M., Porcelli, R., Attanasio, C., &amp; Pulino, M.|first=|date=2007|title=Developing professional skills and social capital through computer supported collaborative learning in university contexts|url=|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=65(2)|pages=140–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Knowledge Building ====
Knowledge co-construction among geographically dispersed students in an online postgraduate program was explained in a study as students relied heavily on each other for their on-going participation in the online discussions and joint refinement of ideas introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zenios, M|first=|date=2011|title=Epistemic activities and collaborative learning: Towards an analytical model for studying knowledge construction in networked learning settings|url=|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|volume=27(3)|pages=259–268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Principles &amp; Instructional Strategies for CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===
The design principles for using CSCL can be considered from different perspectives. For technical use, instructors need to provide tutorials and online training modules to students.&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W|first=|date=2012|title=Using an online learning management system as collaborative media to support adult learning: needs assessment|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology in Teaching and Learning|volume=8(2)|pages=135–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For collaboration, students need time to plan and coordinate group work as well as instructors’ support and guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuopala, E., Hyvönen, P.,&amp; Järvelä, S|first=|date=2016|title=Interaction forms in successful collaborative learning in virtual learning environments|url=|journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|volume=17(1)|pages=25–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the discussions. Also, group size and composition should be taken into consideration for better quality of interaction.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y.|first=|date=2017|title=The Effects of Mobile-Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: Meta-Analysis and Critical Synthesis|url=|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=87|pages=769–805|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More instructional strategies are presented below.

==== Project-Based Settings Using Wikis ====
Wikis is a tool for learners to co-construct knowledge online with the access to create and edit contents. There are three phases of using wikis for collaborative writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin, H. &amp; Kelsey, K.D|first=|date=2009|title=Building networked environment in Wikis: The evolving phases of collaborative learning in a Wikibook project|url=|journal=Educational Computing Research|volume=40(2)|pages=145–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1. Crisis of Authority

Users experience challenges due to unfamiliarity with the use of wiki and the unknown of other teammates’ boundaries of being commented or revised on their writings.

Phase 2. Crisis of Relationship

Collaborative learning emerges and group communication is improved.

Phase 3. Resolution of Crisis

More frequent communication occurs and increased co-writing among team members.

To better design wiki-based project, the design principles design include:

1. Provide learners with a practice article to edit at the beginning of a course for getting familiar with using wikis

2. Informs learners of different communication tools to work collaboratively.

3. Engage learners with repeated wiki article assignments.

4. Provide timely feedback on students’ discussion, participation and interaction.

==== Online Learning Management Systems ====
The characteristic of social interaction in CSCL can be demonstrated on the online learning community where learners can communicate with each other. One of the medium facilitating the online community to work is online learning management system that provides all people including learners, professors, and administrative staff to communicate.

When using an online learning management system for collaborative learning, the instructor should provide technical training by presenting video tutorials, online training modules or online workshops&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"/&gt;

==== Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning ====
Mobile CSCL (mCSCL) is beneficial to students’ learning achievements, attitude and interactions.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"/&gt; The suggested design principles for mCSCL include:

1. An idea group size is around 3 to 4 people.

2. A duration between 1 and 4 weeks demonstrate better effects

=== Professional Teaching Community ===
Professional teacher communities are positively related to student learning, teacher learning, teacher practice and school culture. Teacher collaboration is a significant element of these communities. Reflection‐oriented tasks (such as reflection on teaching performance in individual writing, peer feedback, and collective writing) stimulated participation, and in combination with task structure also interaction in these communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditte Lockhorst, Wilfried Admiraal &amp; Albert Pilot|first=|date=2010|title=CSCL in teacher training: what learning tasks lead to collaboration?|url=|journal=Technology, Pedagogy and Education|volume=19:1|pages=63–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, structured tasks(such as crossword puzzles, the path to come to a solution is unambiguous and answers can be immediately checked) which required critical reflection on personal experiences and perspectives triggered task‐related communication and a deep level of information exchange.

=== Distance Learning ===
The European Union Comenius fund sponsored FISTE project which is concerned with the educational use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), specifically with the development and dissemination of a new pedagogical strategy for distance learning through in-service teacher education in schools across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsteinsson, G. &amp; Page, T (2007) Computer Supportive Communication Learning Approach to Improve In-Service Teachers’ Education in Europe. FISTE - A Future Way For In-Service Teacher Training Across Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; This project uses the online Virtual Learning Environment platform BSCW as a Computer Supportive Communication Learning tool to facilitate the way the participants work together. This work has involved schools and teacher training providers, building culturally different work in in-service teacher education in the participating countries. The value of using CSCL supported technology for in-service teacher education in Europe lies in the concept of hinterland. Cross-national courses like the FISTE would be difficult to run without this technological approach.

'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[storytelling]], [[discussion]], [[teaching]], [[training]], and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICESCR-art13.1"&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means "the art of raising or educating a person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349470945|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0806105697|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living.

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool===

{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where kindergarten is a term often used to describe the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|Primary school students with their teacher, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minors]], to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.

Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===

[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=9781139519526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–70 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a term used to describe self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington |publisher=Neurobonkers.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Swain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/university-campuses-decline-elearning-students? |title=Will university campuses soon be 'over'?  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, ElsabeÂ. "Electronic Education System Model." Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=M. |date=2010 |title=Such a Deal?

A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, [[child protection]], justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Several UN agencies have asserted that [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] should be integrated into school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development goals==
[[File:Education index UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|thumb|World map indicating [[Education Index]] (according to 2007/2008 [[Human Development Report]])]]

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals|last=|first=|publisher=UN|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.

[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Addis Ababa |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |title=Poor governance jeopardises primary education in Africa |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021316/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |archive-date=27 June 2010 |website=Transparency International |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |last=de Grauwe |first=A. |date=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO-IIPE |url=http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |title=Capacity development strategies |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505082915/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
{{Main|Education and technology}}

Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021011082942/http://www.nabuur.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-11 |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227162328/http://isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable.
The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.

The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

==Educational theory==
[[File:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased [[high school]] [[graduation]] rates of students from [[low income]] families.&lt;ref name=finn&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Finn, J.

{{main|Educational theory}}

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404234142/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudbury Valley School]] offers a model of education without a curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2011 |title=Sherlock Holmes was Wrong. |journal=The Sudbury Valley School Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |url=https://sudburyvalley.org/essays/sherlock-holmes-was-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J.

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coyle |first1=Daniel |title=The Talent Code |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-80684-7 |page=159|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Daron Acemoglu |author2=Simon Johnson |author3=James A.

At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of [[Jacob Mincer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacob Mincer|title=The distribution of labor incomes: a survey with special reference to the human capital approach|jstor=2720384|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 8|issue=1|year=1970|pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds). Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999: pp. 1801–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Heckman, Lance J. Lochner, and Petra E. Todd., "Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond," in ''Handbook of the Economics of Education'', Eric A. Hanushek and Finis Welch (Eds). Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high [[intelligence quotient]], may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://som.yale.edu/news/2009/11/why-high-iq-doesnt-mean-youre-smart|title=Why a high IQ doesn't mean you're smart|date=2009-11-01|work=Yale School of Management|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of education==

Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in the [[Isle of Man]]''' is compulsory for children aged between 5 and 16. As a [[Crown dependency]] the Isle of Man parliament and government have competence over all domestic matters, including education; however the structure and curriculum are broadly in line with that of UK schools and particularly the [[National Curriculum for England|English national curriculum]]. Education is overseen by the [[Department of Education, Sport and Culture]] and regulated by the [[Isle of Man Education Act 2001]]. As of September 2017 there were 6,492 pupils in primary schools, and 5,218 pupils in secondary education.&lt;ref name="mediacentre" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Old Grammar School, Castletown - geograph.org.uk - 124105.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Grammar School, Castletown, used as a school from 1701 until 1930]]
Before 1675 there were no schools in the Isle of Man and any education was provided by the church. This changed with the arrival of [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Bishop Isaac Barrow]], who established a school in every parish.

==Education system==
The education system in the Isle of Man is similar to the system used in [[Education in England|England]]. [[Primary school]] consists of seven years, and [[secondary school]] of seven years. All five secondary schools in the Isle of Man have a [[sixth form]] centre.

===Schools===
{{Main|List of schools in the Isle of Man}}
The Department of Education operates 32 [[primary school]]s and 5 [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/education/ Isle of Man Government - Education and Children]. Accessed 27 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Among the primary schools, [[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]] is the only school in the world where children are taught mainly in [[Manx language|Manx]]. [[Independent school]]s include [[King William's College]] and its junior school, [[The Buchan School]].

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}
'''Educational equity''', also referred to as '''equity in education''', is a measure of achievement, fairness, and opportunity in education. The study of education equity is often linked with the study of [[excellence and equity]].

Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is [[Distributive justice|fairness]], which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]], which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/school/39989494.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ten Steps to Equity in Education|publisher=Oecd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual’s level of education directly correlates to future [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, [[Educational inequality|inequity in education]] is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savage Inequalities|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1991|isbn=0770435688|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Equity vs. equality==
Often, the terms "equity" and "equality" are interchanged when referring to educational equity. Although similar, there can be important distinctions between the two.

=== Equity ===
Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle. Examples of this are: “When libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/equalityequity|title=Equality and Equity of Access: What's the Difference?|publisher=Ala.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. [[social justice educational leadership|Social justice leaders]] in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.

=== Equality ===
The [[American Library Association]] defines equality as: “access to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.

==Socio-economic equity in education==
[[File:Education Equality.png|thumb|700px|center|Education equality on countries that are members of the OECD. The numbers correspond to the average difference of points in the results of the PISA test of a student from a high socio-economic level and a student from a low socio-economic level in their respective country. A higher number represents a more unequal education system whilst a smaller number indicates a more equal education system]]

===Income and class===
Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous [[SAT]]/[[ACT (test)|ACT]] prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier.

===Costs of education===
The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a "level playing field" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend [[selective schools]] that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally [[Residential segregation|segregated]] by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/education/poor-students-struggle-as-class-plays-a-greater-role-in-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Poor Students Struggle as Class Plays a Greater Role in Success|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Another contributor to the inequality in the education system is [[tracking (education)|tracking]]. Tracking sorts students into different classes or groups based on ability or future plans. The point of tracking is to create an environment in which the student's abilities match both the curriculum as well as the other student's in the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108013/chapters/What-Tracking-Is-and-How-to-Start-Dismantling-It.aspx|title=Chapter 2. What Tracking Is and How to Start Dismantling It|publisher=Ascd.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation, however, creates an inequality within itself. Starting at an extremely young age, the sorting of students mimics a hierarchy similar to what may form later in life. Students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.

==Racial equity in education==
From a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Race%20equality%20and%20education.pdf|format=PDF|title=Race equality and education : A practical resource for the school workforce : A resource written by Robin Richardson for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to [[State school|public schools]] and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educationnorthwest.org/equity-program/educational|title=Region X Equity Assistance Center - Education Northwest|publisher=Educationnorthwest.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education. 
* US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues a seminal report in 2013. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/eec/equity-excellence-commission-report.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Equity and Excellence Commission For Each and Every Child|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/educationalequity/home|title=Equity In Elementary and Secondary Education: Race, Gender, and National Origin Issues: Home|publisher=Sitemaker.umich.edu|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, [[Korea]], Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/education/learning-world/equity-and-quality-education|title=Equity and Quality in Education|work=Asia Society|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED493386.pdf|format=PDF|title=Racial Equality in Education : How Far Has South Africa Come?|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
Higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students. Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/raceequalitytoolkit/|title=Race Equality Toolkit|publisher=Universities-scotland.ac.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equity in education==
Gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in [[Developing country|developing countries]] where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. [[Global Campaign for Education]] (GCE) followed a survey called "Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acei.org/global-news/gender-discrimination-in-education.html|title=Gender Discrimination in Education|author=Anne|publisher=Acei.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) understands Education as a " fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/right-to-education/|title=The Right to Education - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. 
Figure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Afghanistan]] face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womanstats.org/substatics/Discrepancy%20in%20Secondary%20Education_2010tif_wmlogo3.png|format=PDF|title=Discrepancy in Secondary Education|publisher=Atl.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. A ''[[New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/magazine/02sex3-t.html?_r=0 |title=Teaching boys and girls separately|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights how education systems, especially public school systems, tend to segregate. Boys and girls are often taught with different approaches, which programs children to think they are different and deserve different treatment. However, studies show that boys and girls learn differently, and therefore should be taught differently. Boys learn better when they keep moving, while girls learn better sitting in one place with silence. Therefore—in this reasoning—segregating the genders ''promotes'' gender equity in education, as both boys and girls have optimized learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/03/04/segregating-the-sexes/|title=Gender Differences: The Impact of Gender Stereotyping on School Environment - The Art of Manliness|work=The Art of Manliness|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of gender discrimination in education===
[[Voluntary Service Overseas|VSO]] is a leading independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty and one of the problems they tackle is gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222023026/http://www.vsointernational.org/vso-today/index.asp |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VSO published a paper that categorizes the obstacles (or causes) into:
* Community Level Obstacles: This category primarily relates to the bias displayed for education external to the school environment. This includes restraints due to poverty and child labour, socio-economic constraints, lack of parental involvement and community participation. Harmful practices like child marriage and predetermined gender roles are cultural hindrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development/gender-equality|title=Gender Equality - Education - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* School and Education System Level Obstacles: Lack of investment in quality education, inappropriate attitudes and behaviors, lack of female teachers as role models and lack of gender-friendly school environment are all factors that promote gender inequity in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsointernational.org/Images/VSO%20gender%20equality%20and%20education%20paper_tcm76-32443.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Equality  and Education|publisher=Vsointernational.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of gender discrimination on the economy===
Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country. Equity in education increases the work force of the nation, therefore increasing [[national income]], [[economic productivity]], and [gross domestic product]. It reduces fertility and [[infant mortality]], improves child health, increases life expectancy and increases standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp6532.pdf|format=PDF|title=Gender Effects of Education on Economic Development in Turkey|publisher=Ftp.iza.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are factors that allow [[economic stability]] and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development. Equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/Education_from_a_Gender_Equality_Perspective.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDUCATION FROM A GENDER  EQUALITY PERSPECTIVE |publisher=Ungei.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality|title=Gender inequality|work=The Economist|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an article published by ''The Economist'', which says:

"Looking at recently-published UN statistics on gender inequality in education, one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade, but progress has not been even (see chart). Although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the UN’s gender-inequality target, many parts of Africa are lagging behind. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels."

*University of Pennsylvania: The [[Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education]] unites [[University of Pennsylvania]] scholars who do research on race, racism, racial climates, and important topics pertaining to equity in education. Center staff and affiliates collaborate on funded research projects, environmental assessment activities, and the production of research reports. Principally, the Center aims to publish cutting-edge implications for education policy and practice, with an explicit focus on improving equity in schools, colleges and universities, and social contexts that influence educational outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gse.upenn.edu/equity/content/mission-and-purpose Mission and Purpose | Center for the Study of Race &amp; Equity in Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Equity and Quality in Education (Asia Society): [[Asia Society]] is the leading educational organization dedicated to promoting mutual understanding and strengthening partnerships among peoples, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States in a global context. Across the fields of arts, business, culture, education, and policy, the Society provides insight, generates ideas, and promotes collaboration to address present challenges and create a shared future. The highest performing education systems are those that combine quality with equity. Equity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background, are not obstacles to achieving educational potential (definition of fairness) and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills (definition of inclusion). In these education systems, the vast majority of students have the opportunity to attain high-level skills, regardless of their own personal and socio-economic circumstances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Notable publications and reports ==
Providing opportunities for students to consider racial equality as well as matters of racism as part of their study will help them to develop confidence to engage with these concepts as part of future practice, thinking, and life skills. Race, social class, and gender as issues related to schooling have received major attention from educators and social scientists over the last two decades.

=== Race equality in education - a survey report by England ===
The local authorities in England gave a survey report '''Race equality in education''' in November 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/race-equality-education|title=Ofsted - Race equality in education|publisher=Ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report is based on visits by Her Majesty.s Inspectors (HMIs) and additional inspectors to 12 LEAs and 50 schools in England between summer term 2003 to spring term 2005. This report illustrates good practice on race equality in education in a sample of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed between the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005. The survey focused on schools and LEAs that were involved effectively in race equality in education. Four areas were examined by inspectors: improving standards and achievement amongst groups of pupils, with reference to the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA); the incorporation of race equality concepts into the curriculum in schools; the handling and reporting of race-related incidents in schools; the work of schools and LEAs in improving links with local minority ethnic communities.

=== Race equality and education – by UK educational system ===
The [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] (ATL) (ATL promotes and protects the interests of its members – teachers, lecturers, support staff and other education professionals) introduced a practical resource for the school workforce '''Race equality and education''' in the UK educational system. The publication sets out to examine the racial, religious or cultural terminology regularly used in today's society, in an attempt to combat prejudice based on colour, ethnicity, religion or culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

=== The equity and excellence commission - US education ===
At this decisive moment, the Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues this seminal report. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American [[State school|public schools]] once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Carol D. Lee described the rationale for a special theme issue, "Reconceptualizing Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research." The rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edr.sagepub.com/content/32/5/3.short|title=Why We Need to Re-Think Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research|publisher=Edr.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial equity in education: how far has South Africa come? ===
A major task of South Africa’s new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. This paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts: equal treatment, equal educational opportunity, and educational adequacy. The authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment, primarily through race-blind policies for allocating state funds for schools. Progress measured by the other two criteria, however, has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid, including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students, and by policies such as school fees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Race in education: an argument for integrative analysis ===
Education literature tends to treat race, social class, and gender as separate issues. A review of a sample of education literature from four academic journals, spanning ten years, sought to determine how much these status groups were integrated. The study found little integration. The study then provided a research example on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school. From findings of studies integrating race and class, and race and gender, the study argues that attending only to race, in this example, oversimplifies behavior analysis and may help perpetuate gender and class biases. To determine to what extent race, social class, and gender are integrated in the education literature, the study examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race, or on school issues related directly to race, such as desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/56/2/195.full.pdf+html|title=Sign In|publisher=Rer.sagepub.com|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and quality in education: supporting disadvantaged students and schools–from OECD ===
The report is by the [[OECD]] Education Directorate with support from the Asia Society as a background report for the first [[Asia Society]] Global Cities Network Symposium, Hong Kong, May 10–12, 2012. Asia Society is grateful for OECD's leadership in international [[benchmarking]] and for our ongoing partnership. Asia Society organized the Global Cities Education Network, a network of urban school systems in North America and Asia to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement common to them, and to virtually all city education systems. This report presents the key recommendations of the OECD publication Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools (2012a), which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems, with a particular focus on North American and Asia-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/files/oecd-0512report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Equity and Quality in Education :  Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools|publisher=Asiasociety.org|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in educational equity==
The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|healthcare]], [[income support]], [[child welfare]] and [[social security]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Societal structure and costs===
While both [[basic education]] and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the [[feminist movement]] has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, [[social mobility]] has not increased, while [[economic inequality]] has.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.

===Increase migration and diversity===
As increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor [[social cohesion]] in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating [[minorities]]. Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower [[socio-economic status]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

'''Flat Classroom Project'''  is an award winning global collaborative project for students in Grades 3 -12, inspired by [[Thomas Friedman]]'s book, ''[[The World is Flat]]'', and leverages Web 2.0 tools to foster communication and interaction as well as collaboration and creation between students and teachers from classrooms around the world.

==About==
Co-founded in 2006 by educators Vicki Davis (U.S.) and Julie Lindsay (Australia), the [http://www.flatclassroomproject.net/ Flat Classroom® Project] is a global collaborative project designed for students, typically in Grade 3 - 12, using Web 2.0 tools to support communication and collaboration between students and teachers from classrooms around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Vicki|author2=Julie Lyndsay|title=Flat Classrooms|journal=Learning &amp; Leading with Technology|date=August 2007|volume=35|series=1|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was inspired by topics included in Thomas Friedman's  international bestselling book ''The World Is Flat: The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century'' and was featured in the 2007 update "Release 3.0" of that book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century|year=2007|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-374-29278-7|pages=501–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original project served as a foundation which has been recreated and expanded. Currently the project runs three times a year.

The project has gained international recognition and awards from the [[International Society for Technology in Education|International Society of Technology Educators]](ISTE), Taking IT Global, [[World Innovation Summit for Education]], and [[The Edublog Awards|Edublog Awards]] and has fostered four similar projects based on the same holistic and constructivist educational approach, including the Digiteen, Eracism, NetGenEd, and A Week in the Life projects. 

The first spin-off the NetGenEd Project, originally called the Horizon Project, examines the book ''Growing Up Digital'', by [[Don Tapscott]], in conjunction with the New Media Consortium's annual ''Horizon Report''.

Another spin-off effort is the [http://www.flatclassroomconference.com/ Flat Classroom™ Conference] which brings together geographically distant students that may have participated in one of the affiliated projects for a face-to-face meeting. At the conference students share ideas and take part in theme-based workshops to take back to their home schools. Themes are designed to explore global social issues and inspire unity and action, while advancing continued student-to-student and educator-to-educator connections.

===Pedagogical approach===

The goal of the Flat Classroom Project is to create global collaborative projects and maintain workspaces for students (at all school levels) and educators around the world. The aim is to provide bridging between students, educators, trainee teachers, and post-secondary education institutions.

By "flattening" the walls of the traditional classroom, participating classes essentially become one large virtual classroom, co-taught by participating teachers, via the Internet and a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boss|first=Suzie|title=Reinventing Project Based Learning: Your field guide to real-world projects in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=International Society for Technology in Education|location=Eugene, OR|isbn=978-1-56484-238-1|author2=Jane Krauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is designed to: 
* develop cultural understanding;
* further skills with Web 2.0 and other software tools;
* provide experience in global collaboration and online learning;
* raise awareness of what it means to live and work in a globalised world;

The core pedagogical approach includes the development of two primary products. The first product involves groups of students working collaboratively to compose a wiki web page, based on topic research, and using [[Wikipedia]] as a model. The second product involves individual students creating a multimedia artefact, again based on topic research, which should also include a portion requested from another student in a different part of the world. Student work is assessed with common criteria-based rubrics and reviewed by a panel of international judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonk|first=Curtis Jay|title=The World is Open: How Web Technology is Revolutionizing Education|year=2009|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-470-46130-3|pages=265–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is designed as a multi-modal, inter-disciplinary learning experience that highlights digital citizenship. Additionally, participating students are encouraged to develop [[Personal Learning Networks|Personal Learning Environments and Networks]], using a variety of Internet tools, while conducting their research.

== Projects ==

=== Flat Classroom Original Project ===

=== Eracism ===

=== NetGen Project ===

=== Digiteen Project ===

=== A Week in the Life.... Project ===

With the success of the other projects it became apparent that many teachers of elementary students were wanting to also take part in the Flat Classroom experience. Beginning in October 2010 through to February 2011 eight international schools joined together to plan, work through and initiate the project.

'''Schools Involved'''

* The Phoenix School - Salem, Massachusetts
* International School of Bombay - Mumbai, India
* Yew Chung International School of Beijing - China
* International School of Prague - Czech Republic
* Denton Avenue School - New York
* Falcon School for Girls - London, England
* Yarmouth Elementary School - Yarmouth, Maine
* Mill Creek School - Illinois

Five different categories were chosen for the students to investigate their lives and compare them to other students in the project.  The categories chosen were Food and Celebrations, Clothing, Transportation, School Life and Housing.  Within each of these categories teams were created with members from each school participating.  A teacher mentor was in charge of each category to keep the teams focused. Synchronous and asynchornous methods were used to allow for authentic global collaboration among the students. At the end of the project each team combined their information together into one artifact representing their category sharing their lives from around the world. Teachers as well as students greatly benefited from the collaboration and helped to building relationships that are continuing on.

The pilot project was deemed a success and it has developed into a regular project under the Flat Classroom umbrella.

'''The GRE Literature in English Test''' is a [[standardized test]] administered by the [[Educational Testing Service]]. It is intended to evaluate applicants seeking admission to a [[graduate program]] in [[English Studies]]. The test surveys a wide range of topics related to literature in English, but the focus is on works long 
accepted as part of the [[Western canon|canon]].

Scores are scaled and then reported as a number between 200 and 800; however, in recent versions of the test, the maximum and minimum reported scores have been 760 (corresponding to the 99 percentile) and 320 (1 percentile) respectively. The mean score for all test takers from July, 2009, to July, 2012, was 549 with a standard deviation of 99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_guide_table2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content specification==

The test contains 230 questions, grouped in four broad categories. Since many students who apply to graduate programs in English do so during the first half of their fourth year, the scope of most questions is largely that of the first three years of a standard American undergraduate English curriculum. A sampling of test item content is given below:

===Literary analysis (40-55%)===

* Conventions and genres
* Allusions and references
* Meaning and tone
* Grammar and [[rhetoric]]
* Literary techniques

===Identification (15-20%)===

This section tests the ability of examinees to perform recognition of date, author or work by style and/or content. The literary-historical scope of the test is as follows:

* Continental, classical and comparative literature through 1925 (5-10%)
* British literature through 1660 (including [[John Milton]]) (25-30%)
* British literature from 1660 to 1925 (25-30%)
* American literature through 1925 (15-25%)
* Literature in English after 1925 (20-30%)

===Cultural and historical contexts (20-25%)===

* Literary history
* Cultural history
* Identification of details in a work

===Literary criticism (10-15%)===

Identification and analysis of the characteristics and methods of various critical and theoretical approaches.

'''Graduation''' is getting a diploma or [[academic degree]] or the ceremony that is sometimes associated with it, in which students become [[Alumnus|graduates]].  Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called '''graduation day'''. The graduation ceremony itself is also called '''commencement''', '''convocation''' or '''invocation'''. Normally, the ceremony and name apply to high school and above (the next ascending levels being Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate). In the United States of America, graduations for elementary school or even Kindergarten have been a development of recent years. When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a [[valediction]]. At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear [[academic dress]] at the formal ceremonies, as will the [[trustees]] and degree candidates.

"Graduation" at the college and university level occurs when the presiding officer confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or en masse, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or [[academic department|departmental]] ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.

In some places, [[Party#Graduation party|graduation parties]] to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular. In a recent 2014 nationwide survey in the United States, $985 was the average amount spent on graduation parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduationparty.com/graduation-party-budgeting.htm|title=Graduation Party Budget|work=graduationparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student graduates without attending the ceremony, then it is called '''graduation ''[[in absentia]]'''''.

==By country==
{{Further|Academic graduation by country}}

The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. Whereas in the United Kingdom a graduation usually only occurs at university level, in the United States of America and many other countries graduations also occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are conferred upon the graduates. In a graduation ceremony the students dress up in special graduation caps and clothing that are made just for this purpose.

Graduation traditions are varied across universities observing different cultures. Most universities across Sweden are research-oriented and may present its students with bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. A large number of candidates continue their education onto secondary and upper secondary education. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, Math and Science among majors.

In Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most of is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the President of Zimbabwe officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the President's hand. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is Zimbabwe's ex-President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. At other State Institutions of higher learning the vice Presidents or any other Senior Government officials may preside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Mugabe caps 1 986 at Nust {{!}} The Herald|url = http://www.herald.co.zw/president-mugabe-caps-1-986-at-nust/|website = www.herald.co.zw|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of graduation==
Ceremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the 12th century. At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. A "universitas" was a guild of masters (MAs) with licence to teach. "Degree" and "graduate" come from gradus, meaning "step". The first step was admission to a bachelor's degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. The typical dress for graduation are gowns and hoods or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Graduation through the ages http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/graduation/grad-history.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid 18th century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front. The graduation hat tradition was initially brought into practice by students at [[Uppsala University]]. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8202511/Swedish_high_school_graduation_day|title=Swedish high school graduation day|author=Elin Olsson|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''virtual learning environment''' (VLE) is a system that creates an environment designed to facilitate teachers' management of educational courses for their students, especially a system using computer hardware and software, which involves distance learning. In North America, a virtual learning environment is often referred to as a "[[learning management system]]" (LMS).

===1965===
* A five-year study of the impact of the PLATO system is published.&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt; Here are some highlights: "The results of exploratory queuing studies show that the system could teach as many as a thousand students simultaneously, while still allowing each student to proceed through the material independently." The PLATO system had two different ways to teach – "tutorial logic" where the system presented facts and examples, and then asked questions on the materials presented, and "inquiry logic" where the student could request and organize appropriate information from the computer. The presentation of materials ("slide selector") was called an ''electronic book''. The store of information in the system was called an ''electronic blackboard''. PLATO had a sophisticated ''help system'', whereby different types of wrong answers resulted in the student being sent different help sequences. A rudimentary ''spell checker'' was included in the system. A ''comment page'' allowed the student to comment on the lessons at any time. An ''instructor page'' allowed the instructor to communicate with the student. A "perfect workbook" recorded student responses to questions, as well as kept a ''record of each button the student pushed'' and the time at which he or she pushed it. These records were stored on magnetic tape for later ''statistical analysis''.

* [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded three initial projects for the study of "Natural Language Processing." These projects included the University of California, Irvine Physics Computer Development Project, headed by Alfred Bork and Research Assistant, Richard L. Ballard. The Mitre Ticcit Project conducted at the University of Texas, later moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and its sister project called the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO Project]], was conducted at the University of Illinois, Champaign. Over 140 natural language dialog programs were created between 1970 and 1978. UCI's Physics Computer Development Project conducted approximately 55 educational programs and spearheaded development throughout the UC system. Initial projects were conducted on [[ASR-33 Teletype|Teletype model 33]], paper tape punch machine that operated at a 110 baud rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Alfred|last=Bork|first2=Richard|last2=Ballard|title=The Physics Computer Development Project|journal=Journal of College Science Teaching|volume=II|issue=4|date=April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Patrick Suppes]], professor at [[Stanford University]], developed computer-based courses in [[Logic]] and [[Set Theory]] that were offered to Stanford undergraduates from 1972 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suppes|first=Patrick|title=Computer Assistede Instruction|url=http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/articles/comped/278.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Learning Research Group is formed at [[Xerox PARC]] in Palo Alto, California. It is led by [[Alan Kay]], who advanced the idea of a graphical user interface (GUI) by inventing icons for folders, menus, and overlapping windows. Kay and his group envisioned a computer for teaching and learning that they called the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205105015/http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf KiddiKomputer]", to be programmed using the [[Smalltalk]] language they had developed. While Kay could see many educational uses for this computer, he had four initial projects in mind: 1) Teaching thinking skills, 2) Teaching modeling through the simulation of systems, 3) Teaching interface skills, and 4) Tracking what children would do with the computer outside school hours, when left to their own devices. Second level projects for teaching children with a computer included 1) Computer evaluation, 2) Iconic programming, especially for children under 8. Kay and his colleagues started teaching programming to children and adults in 1973.

* A report written for the University of Michigan described the educational uses of computers at the university. These included "drill, skills practice, programmed and dialog tutorials, testing and diagnosis, simulation, gaming, information processing, computation, problem solving, model construction, graphic display, the management of instructional resources, and the presentation and display of materials."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Karl (1973) Contributions of Computing to College Teaching and Learning Activities at the University of Michigan.

* An integrated student information system at Trinity University in Texas maintained data on about 1,500 variables. These included all student academic and personal data, all faculty data that dealt with courses and teaching, all course data in regards to student, faculty and class meeting times and days, enrollments, buildings, and the college calendar and catalog. There was also "an interaction course management system".&lt;ref&gt;Yost, Michael (1973) Extracting Data from Integrated Student Information Systems. ERIC Document ED244563.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a post-doc at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], Jay Warner needed to teach undergraduate metallurgy students how to use new software that would calculate phase diagrams (graphical representations of metal states/phases as a function of composition and temperature) based on thermodynamic properties. He wrote a CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) module that, however crudely, used some of the principles discussed in this article. A frame, or paragraph of information, was presented, and the machine branched to different follow-up frames and questions depending on the response to the embedded questions. The whole thing was written in FORTRAN IV. It proved useful; students could then use the software without close attendance by the instructor. This work was in no way as dramatic as the other accomplishments of the day, however it does show that by this time CAL was not restricted to studies of learning methods.

* [[Prestel]], claimed by BT as "the world's first public viewdata service", was opened in London in September, running on a cluster of minicomputers. It had been conceived in the early 1970s by [[Samuel Fedida]] of the Post Office Research Laboratories at Dollis Hill, London. Similar developments were under way in France (Teletel) and Canada (Telidon). Only those active at the time will remember the sense of euphoria and opening of possibilities in what would now be called the e-business and e-learning worlds. (Sadly, the concept was premature, although in France it had most success.) A number of mainframe, minicomputer and even micro-computer based systems and services were later developed in educational circles of which perhaps the best known were OPTEL, Communitel, ECCTIS and NERIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021215160137/http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm | archivedate = 2002-12-15| title = Events in Telecommunications History| accessdate = 2006-08-14| author = British Telecommunications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, groups including [[TVOntario]], [[Athabasca University]], the [[University of Victoria]], and the [[University of Waterloo]] participated in [http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/telidon/telidon_twoway.html Telidon] experiments during the late 70s and early 80s. [[Telidon]], an alphageometric videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and teletext systems. This [http://www.amtec.ca/cjlt/vol15no2.pdf work continued until 1983], when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard – ANSI T500 – NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax).
* The Athabasca University educational Telidon project used a Unix path structure which allowed the storage of information pages in the file system tree. This is now the universal storage method for pages on the internet. As described, the system had the ability to create separate user groups with different access privileges, and to implement "action scripts" to access system functions, including email and dynamic content generation. The AU system was described in Abell, R.A. "Implementation of a Telidon System Using UNIX File Structures" in Godfrey, D. and Chang, E. (eds) The Telidon Book, Reston Publishing Company, Reston, VA, 1981)

* Successmaker is a K–12 learning management system with an emphasis on reading, spelling and numeracy. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032227/http://www.pearsondigital.com/successes/successmaker/southcolonie.cfm Pearson Digital Learning website], the South Colonie Central School District in Albany, New York "has been using SuccessMaker since 1980, and in 1997 the district upgraded the software to SuccessMaker version 5.5."
* The Open University begins a pilot trial of a viewdata (videotex) system OPTEL, on a [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. This had been conceived by Peter Zorkoczy even before the launch of the national Prestel system in 1979 and was locally specified and coded (in [[COBOL]]) by Peter Frogbrook (RIP) and Gyan Mathur. One of the main motivations was its applicability to online learning. It was available via dial-up from home, and later in the 1980s via telnet(!) on the [[X.25]] and internet networks. There were individual user codes and passwords, giving different access rights; the one generic access code was regularly attacked by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] even in these far-off days, as URLs still on the web attest. The system is overviewed in [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?accno=ED247893&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Viewdata-Style+Delivery+Mechanisms+for+CAL&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=kw"Viewdata-Style Delivery Mechanisms for CAL", CAL Research Group Technical Report No. 11.]

* TLM (The Learning Manager) was released in 1980 and included distinct roles for students, instructors, educational assistants, and administrators. The system could be accessed remotely by dial-up as a student or an instructor using a terminal emulator. The system had a sophisticated test bank capability and generated tests and practice activities based on a learning objective data structure. Instructors and students could communicate through the terminal. Instructors could lock out students or post messages. Originally called LMS (Learning Management System), TLM was used extensively at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) and Bow Valley College, both located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w-win.com/learningmanagementsystems/history/ |title=The Learning Manager&amp;reg |publisher=W-win.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio-visual material for Cyclops was produced on the ''Cyclops Studio '', a multimedia editing system coded in UCSD Pascal by a software team led by Paul Bacsich and including Mark Woodman. Cyclops was later awarded a BCS prize for innovation and systems installed in Indonesia. There are only passing references now to Cyclops on the open Web (see under names cited) – the best source of specifications and chronology is the article "Cyclops:shared-screen teleconferencing" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education'', edited Tony Bates, Croom Helm, 1984.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Tony &amp; Helm, Croom, eds.

* Over this period the Open University was also developing its own viewdata (videotex) system, called OPTEL, for use in education. This had in fact started about the same time as Cyclops in yet another team at the OU. The project ran until about 1985 when it faded away, as did videotex generally across the world (except the Minitel in France). In addition to OPTEL, several other systems were implemented including VOS (Videotex Operating System) which allowed the display and manipulation of text files via videotex. VOS was further developed into a telesoftware, transactional (gateway) and email system and then used in a commercial development for IMS, the media research company (using a very early precursor of Web/CGI development). These were coded in Pascal and COBOL on the [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. Some of the ideas of OPTEL were taken over into the ECCTIS project delivering course data via viewdata from a Unisys mainframe – indeed one of the former OPTEL staff joined ECCTIS as Director. Systems were also specified to deliver Computer-Assisted Learning – see in particular the article "Viewdata systems" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''.&lt;ref name=Bates /&gt; There are only fragmentary references now to OPTEL on the open Web.

* Peter Smith of the UK Open University completes his PhD thesis (157 pp) on "Radiotext: an application of computer and communication systems in distance teaching". (Only [http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews1_11.asp one reference] online.) It is believed that the work started in the late 1970s under the supervision of Peter Zorkcoczy, who also conceived the OPTEL viewdata system. Radiotext denoted the transmission of data over radio signals, just as it can be sent over telephone lines. It may seem normal now, as in the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS) in these days of digital radio, but in the 1970s the concept was novel and complex for their colleagues to grasp.

* From this year until 1991 several UK groups of researchers associated in one way or another with the Open University, the UK Department for Industry (especially the Alvey programme, the transputer team and the Information Technology Consultancy Unit) and the emerging European Commission DELTA programme, carry out a mass of specification and prototyping work on "educational environments". Projects include the Thought Box; the Learning Systems Reference Model; Portable Educational Tools Environment (joint OU, Harlequin and Chorus Systèmes); and Transputer-Based Communications-oriented Learning System. Among the non-OU co-workers were Chris Webb, Bill Olivier and Oleg Liber, all still active in e-learning. (No useful material left on the current public Web.)
* Authorware Inc. is formed in Minneapolis/St. Paul. From initial prototypes developed on both mainframe and very early personal computers, a Macintosh-based authoring system called "Course of Action" is introduced; later a PC version is developed. Shortly after its introduction, the title of the authoring system is changed to match the name of the company. [[Authorware]] went on to become the first and most widely used industry-standard development tool.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

* 1987, Glenn Jones of Jones Intercable in Denver, Colorado believed he saw a potential goldmine when he created a new system, called Mind Extension University in 1987. Jones created a system where telecourses could be provided across a network to various colleges and at the same time, students could interact with the instructors and each other, by using email, sent over the internet. Jones then began to beam the courses by satellite, so anyone with a satellite dish could watch the classes and if they had a computer and a phone line they could interact with the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiu.edu/about/faces/profiles/glenn_jones.php Jones International University]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A group of companies in Alberta, working with Alberta Government Telephones, create a pre-internet "whiteboard-like" audiographic teleconferencing system. Using PCs, specialized NAPLPS-based software, and audioconferencing bridges, the system shares graphics, text, and voice, for synchronous multipoint instructor/student student/student communication. The system was used by the Commonwealth of Learning in several locations around the globe, and was also used by Arctic College in Alaska for distance education. In some implementations, the students uploaded assignments to instructors for marking. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

* Publication of the book ''Mindweave: Communication, Computers and Distance Education'', edited by Robin Mason and Anthony Kaye (published by Pergamon Press, Oxford, 273p). This was a hugely influential book on computer conferencing on which many of the leading experts of the time collaborated.

* The first public article specifying the ''Thought Box'' appears as Chapter 7 of ''Mindweave'', written by Gary Alexander and Ches Lincoln. It is entitled "The thought box: A computer-based communication system to support distance learning". Although the specification is couched in terms of a hardware device linked to a remote mail/resources server the article also describes the prototype work being done in HyperCard, and it could be argued that this software prototype had many of the features of a modern ''Personal Learning Environment''. In fact, over the next few years, the HyperCard route was the way by which the ideas were advanced, eventually appearing in the XT001 online course in the early 1990s and in several other Open University courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The thought box:A computer-based communication system to support distance learning |url=http://www.ead.ufms.br/marcelo/mindware/chap7.html |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215000049/http://www.ead.ufms.br/marcelo/mindware/chap7.html |archivedate=December 15, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991===
* In datacloud|''Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work'', Johndan Johnson-Eilola describes a specific computer-supported collaboriation space: [[smart board|The Smart Board]], which was introduced in 1991. According to Johnson-Eilola, a “Smart Board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, intelligent whiteboard surface for work” (79). In datacloud|''Datacloud'', Johnson-Eilola asserts that “[w]e are attempting to understand how users move within information spaces, how users can exist within information spaces rather than merely gaze at them, and how information spaces must be shared with others rather than being private, lived within rather than simply visited” (82). He explains how the Smart Board system offers an information space that allows his students to engage in active collaboration. He makes three distinct claims regarding the functionality of the technology: 1) The Smart Board allows users to work with large amounts of information, 2) It offers an information space that invites active collaboration, 3) The work produced is often “dynamic and contingent” (82).&lt;ref name="Johnson-Eilola, Johndan 2005"&gt;Johnson-Eilola, Johndan. Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, Inc., 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Johnson-Eilola further explains that with the Smart Board “…information work becom[es] a bodied experience” (81). Users have the opportunity to engage with—inhabit—the technology by direct manipulation. Moreover, this space allows for more than one user; essentially, it invites multiple users.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Eilola, Johndan 2005"/&gt;

* Neville Gordon-Carroll and Vaughn Taylor at Microsoft launched MOLI - Microsoft Online Institute - an online learning proof of concept built as a result of an intensive research project into the future of technology based learning. The desired outcome was a platform for self-directed learning at any time, from anywhere with content that was dynamically updated and immediately relevant. MOLI was initially developed by Microsoft on the MSN proprietary platform then rapidly migrated to the internet as Microsoft embraced the internet in mid 1995. Microsoft Online Institute was a simple hosted learning platform that was made available to private and public learning institutions to conduct and experiment with their own classrooms, content and instruction model. During this time Microsoft actively evangelized internet based learning to higher education institutions, learning content developers and traditional education companies. Despite initial resistance to this new learning model several companies and institutions used MOLI as an experimental platform before launching their own offerings.

==Basic Principles==

The following are the basic principles of the Individual Education School System:

* Children can veto their attendance in a class.
* Children are not in a competition or race; they only compete against themselves.
* Children decide if and when to study and there is no homework unless the child asks for it.
* Children can learn in whatever fashion works for them.
* Feedback regarding their learning is given to children as soon as possible.
* Every child has a teacher-adviser, an in-school parent figure who the child chooses.
* There are only three rules; they are impartially and strictly enforced.
* Children have the opportunity to develop special talents if they wish.
* Children are offered a wide range of creative/applied courses.
* Learning is considered a privilege, not an obligation.
* Teachers have the right to ask a child to leave a classroom or to stay out of their classroom.
* The school day is divided roughly equally between academic, creative/ applied and socialization.
* All evaluations are objective—not subjective.
* Idiosyncratic classroom rules may be established by the teacher for their class, so long as they don't violate Individual Education principles.
* The "GO" and "STOP" signals are the only means of enforcing rules in the classroom.
* Peer teaching is encouraged.
* Academic progress reports are kept on children, but grades are not given out.
* An individualized pace of learning is encouraged.
* Teachers are responsible for teaching; children are responsible for learning.
* The emphasis is on the development of a successful person.
* Community resources are accessed where possible.
* Children may be ''advised'' to study at the growing edge of their abilities, but the level at which they study is no one's choice but theirs.
* Faculty has three jobs: academic teaching, creative/applied teaching, and socialization training/advising.
* Regular full classroom meetings are mandatory.
* Rewards, honors and other extraneous motivators should be avoided.
* Criticisms, warnings, or various other forms of punishment are strictly forbidden.
* The school operates on the basis of natural and logical consequences, using encouragement and intrinsic joy from skill mastery as the primary motivators for learning.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisan|first=Larry|title=Individual Education International|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|date=Summer 2003|volume=59|issue=2|pages=207–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children have the right to go to any other classroom or supervised library or study hall.
* On any given day, children can choose not to learn.
* Teachers have full freedom in teaching the curriculum, but cannot force children to follow it.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Speaking Out: A Clarification Letter to the Editors: A Critique of Clark's "Individual Education"|journal=The Clearing House|year=1987|volume=60|issue=5|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321|doi=10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Four Rs: Responsibility, Respect, Resourcefulness, Responsiveness===

====Responsibility====
A primary goal of Individual Education is to make children self-sufficient, giving them the mean to become a productive member of society; to become mature and self-reliant. Individual Education is against the infantilization of the child. Instead, Individual Education maximizes the child's self-determination.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Individual Education|url=http://www.psychotherapyinstitute.com/documents/IndividualEducationFull.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Respect====
Individual Education is designed to develop in children feeling of respect of the self and of others. Traditional school systems make children feel inferior and make many of them feel unsuccessful. A system based on rewards and punishment, praise and disapproval, is considered morally bankrupt in the Individual Education system. Some children are not born into environments conducive to academics. Some children have strengths not visible in the traditional system. Any system that insults these children is wrong.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Resourcefulness====
Every child has innate talents, and some strengths and weaknesses. Whatever resources the child has, Individual Education permits expression, whether academic or non-academic. If little Michaelangelo wants to paint, let him. If he therefore never learns how to solve square roots, so be it. If little Willy Gates doesn't want to leave his computer alone, let him. If he therefore never reads Shakespeare, so be it. As long as Michaelangelo can do basic math, and Willy can read well, that is enough. For others, a broader program will be necessary. The child will determine the program that best suits him/her. The curriculum will be there when he/she needs it. The teacher will encourage learning of all types of academe, but will not force it.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Responsiveness====
The concept of Social Interest (''Gemeinschaftsgefuhl'' in Adlerian theory) is central to Individual Education. It means responding to the needs of others. It can be seen in school spirit, patriotism, love for family, or elsewhere. This is critical to a child becoming a productive and happy member of society.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt; This goal is not achieved directly, but rather through the achievement of the first 3 Rs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Timothy|title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_199009_evans.pdf|publisher=Educational Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Program ==
The curriculum in the academic component is similar to that in the traditional system.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, Timothy D. |author2=Corsini, Raymond J. |author3=Gazda, George M. |title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|journal=Educational Leadership|date=September 1990|volume=48|issue=1|pages=52|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9107151407/individual-education-4rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language, mathematics, history/geography and science are developed along the mastery model—through a skills list through which children progress from the beginning of school to the end. Children are tested weekly on average but it is the children who request to be tested; teachers cannot demand that tests be written. Instead a Progress Chart shows how far along the child is (80% is considered mastery). The child doesn't have to learn what he/she has already learned—if the child can pass a test without attending class, the Progress Chart is marked identically to that of a child that attended hours of classroom study. A quick learner is offered the next level of curriculum and the opportunity to tutor others. No numerical or letter-based grading system is used.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Creative/Applied Courses==
These courses can be offered in 6-8 week blocks. 1-3 can be chosen out of 9-12 courses offered. Included are topics students want to learn but do not find in traditional curriculum.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; They usually involve some physical activities (e.g. soccer), some artistic ones (visual arts) and some applied (horticulture). Teachers offer courses in areas of their interest. Community resources are used where possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Socialization aspect==
Teachers socialize children through their positions as teachers and advisers. Children can choose their adviser, though the teacher can choose whether to accept that student.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"/&gt;  The adviser is an equal to the child in this environment (unlike during the academic program), and can only enforce the first school rule, related to dangerous behavior (see below). They meet as a group (the adviser with all children who have chosen him or her, or in the absence of a decision by the child, the child is assigned an adviser).Among other things, students learn about problem solving, health maintenance, interpersonal communications and purpose in life.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; The adviser supervises homeroom, which occurs at the beginning and end of the day and is unstructured. At least once a week and sometimes every day, the adviser holds a class meeting during which time the children discuss their various concerns. Rules regarding homeroom and class meetings can only be decided democratically. The teacher can suggest rules but the children decide by a vote.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The adviser is also the liaison between the child and other teachers with whom there may be difficulties, and can act as a mediator. The adviser also liaises with the child's parents but only on rare occasions and only with the child's consent. The child should always be in the room during such discussions if possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The socialization program includes "playtime" for younger children. Other teachers are also free to discuss social matters with children, as equals.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Disciplinary Procedure==
Individual Education schools have only three school rules:&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;
# Never do anything that could be dangerous, damaging or harmful to yourself or others, or property.
# Be in a supervised place or en route to a supervised place.
# If a teacher gives you the GO signal, leave the room immediately and silently and without distracting the others.

There are no exceptions to these rules. Violation of one of these rules means the child is given a violation slip which they take to the office to have recorded.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

Teachers can establish idiosyncratic classrooms, but they cannot violate the three rules above. Because there are so few rules, teachers must ensure that they are strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

These rules are largely based on the discipline concepts of Rudolf Dreikurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs, R., Grunwald, B., and Pepper, F.|title=Maintaining sanity in the classroom|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dreikurs' concept of logical consequences is particularly useful in understanding the Individual Education disciplinary procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs|first=Rudolf|title=Psychology in the Classroom|year=1957|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GO and STOP===

The GO signal is a gesture towards the door. A teacher may quietly say the child's name and make the gesture. The child must then leave the classroom immediately and silently without disruption to others. The child then has a few options: go to another class; go to the study hall; go to the library; seek to re-enter the classroom. The child can return to the classroom but may be given the STOP signal at that time, which means the child must go to another option. The STOP signal is a hand held face up in the direction of the child entering.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

Teachers should not keep track of the number of times they give out the GO and STOP signals. They have no meaning in terms of the child's progress in school, and should carry no social consequences. A teacher must not warn the child of an impending GO signal, nor intimidate the child by standing close to them or giving them negative looks. There is no use in intimidating the child, who will rebel against such an attempt.&lt;ref name=Nisan2003 /&gt;

===Consequences of Violations===

For each violation there is a consequence. If the ultimate consequence of expulsion is applied, it should include a referral to other professional help.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

===Findings===
Research articles have indicated the following findings:
# Students' scores on standardized achievement tests typically exceed national averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=232–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Yearly academic gains are similar. Several schools that were initially low in district academic rank made impressive gains in rank. This is in spite of only half the amount of academic instructional time being spent in Individual Education schools compared to the traditional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=How Corsini 4R Schools Work|journal=Individual Education International|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are far less disciplinary problems in Individual Education schools.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41–57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education Through 1984|journal=Individual Psychology|year=1985|volume=41|pages=41–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In many cases, 100% of teachers surveyed in a school have said that they prefer teaching in an Individual Education school rather than in a traditional one. The main comment is that teachers can put their energies into teaching.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41–57"/&gt;
# Parents endorse the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=L.|title=Summary of Research on an Individual Education School|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Present Status of Individual Education==

Raymond Corsini recognized in the late 1960s that adults were mistakenly blaming children for their poor behavior and grades in school when the problems were promoted by the school system in which the children operated. Corsini argued that the traditional system of education was fundamentally undemocratic. Children were "sentenced" to attend an institution where they had no choice of teacher or level of study, and minimal choice in terms of subjects, places or means of study. He set out to design a school system in which respect would be a central principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Alternative Education Systems|year=1979|publisher=F.E. Peacock|location=Itasca, IL|author2=Ignar, E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Paul Clark confirmed that Individual Education is an effective method of encouraging learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Paul A.|title=A Case Study of Two Corsini 4R Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED302907&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED302907|publisher=Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association (Louisville, KY, November 8–11, 1988).|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a dozen individual education schools operating in North America and Europe, including Hawaii, Illinois, Colorado, British Columbia and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Keith A|title=Individual Education/Corsini's 4R Schools: Another Look|journal=Individual Psychology|date=September 1987|volume=43|issue=3|pages=370–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One school, the Blooming Grove Academy, operated in Bloomington, Illinois from 1986 until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blooming Grove Academy Student/Parent Handbook|url=http://www.bloominggroveacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ParentHandbook.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to overthrow [[materialism]] and [[atheism]]. Its proponents believe that society has suffered "devastating" cultural consequences from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because it seeks only natural explanations, and is therefore atheistic. They believe that the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. They seek to "reverse the stifling dominance of the [[Materialism|materialist]] [[world view|worldview]]", represented by the theory of evolution, in favor of "a science consonant with [[Christian]] and [[Theism|theistic]] convictions."&lt;ref name="wedge_strategy" /&gt;

To achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to "[[Teach the Controversy]]"; discredit evolution by emphasizing perceived flaws in the theory of evolution, or disagreements within the [[scientific community]] and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific alternatives to evolution, or to critically analyze evolution and the controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution. But the world's largest general scientific society, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], has stated that "There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution." and that "Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science."&lt;ref name="ttc_aaas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml |title=AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws as Hundreds of K-12 Teachers Convene for 'Front Line' Event |last=Pinholster |first=Ginger |date=February 19, 2006 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Washington, D.C. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421193306/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml |archivedate=2006-04-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the 2005 [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], trial, ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal court]], stated that "evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is 'overwhelmingly accepted' by the scientific community."&lt;ref name="kitzmillerpg70"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|vol=04|reporter=cv|opinion=2688|date=December 20, 2005}} [[s:Kitzmiller v.

The [[Discovery Institute]] (DI) is a religious [[think tank]] that drives the intelligent design movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Attie, et al. 2006|Attie, et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse - A Conversation With Barbara Forrest |date=February 2005 |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2005-church-state/featured/intelligent-design-creationism%E2%80%99s-trojan-horse-a |journal=Church &amp; State |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Unabridged interview |publisher=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] |issn=2163-3746 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |quote=Patricia O'Connell Killen, a religion professor at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma whose work centers around the regional religious identity of the Pacific Northwest, recently wrote that 'religiously inspired think tanks such as the conservative evangelical Discovery Institute' are part of the 'religious landscape' of that area.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its program advisor [[Phillip E.

According to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement's purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement's "activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it."&lt;ref name="Forrest_2001" /&gt; Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of [[Book of Genesis|biblical]] [[creationism]] to [[State school#United States|public school]] science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a [[theocracy]], primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute's political activities, its wedge strategy and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents. The scientific community's position, as represented by the National Academy of Sciences and the [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE), is that intelligent design is not science, but creationist [[pseudoscience]]. [[Richard Dawkins]], a biologist and professor at [[Oxford University]], compares the intelligent design movement's demand to "teach the controversy" with the demand to teach [[flat Earth]]ism; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. "If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science--one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat--you are misleading children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |date=August 7, 2005 |title=The Evolution Wars |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-3,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--TIME Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32--&gt;

== Philosophy ==
At the 1999 "Reclaiming America for Christ Conference" called by Reverend [[D. James Kennedy]] of Coral Ridge Ministries, Phillip E. Johnson gave a speech called "How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won."&lt;ref name="debate_won"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |title=How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E |authorlink=Phillip E.

James Kennedy|Coral Ridge Ministries]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107005414/http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |publisher=Coral Ridge Ministries |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |archivedate=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he sums up the theological and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for victory:

{{quotation|To talk of a purposeful or guided evolution is not to talk about evolution at all. That is "slow creation." When you understand it that way, you realize that the Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a Creator brought about our existence for a purpose. That is the first thing I realized, and it carries tremendous meaning.}}
{{quotation|I have built an intellectual movement in the universities and churches that we call "The Wedge," which is devoted to scholarship and writing that furthers this program of questioning the materialistic basis of science. One very famous book that's come out of The Wedge is biochemist Michael Behe's book ''Darwin's Black Box'', which has had an enormous impact on the scientific world.}}
{{quotation|Now, the way that I see the logic of our movement going is like this. The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence, and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, "Well, where might you get truth?" When I preach from the Bible, as I often do at churches and on Sundays, I don't start with Genesis. I start with John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word." In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right and the materialist scientists are deluding themselves.|Johnson|How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won&lt;ref name="debate_won"/&gt;}}

== History of the movement ==
The intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually that of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] or [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalistic Christianity]]. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a designer who may or may not be [[God]], all the movement's leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda.

=== Origins ===
The modern use of the words "intelligent design," as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry, began after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in the case of ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987), ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that [[Charles Thaxton]], editor of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', had picked the phrase up from a [[NASA]] scientist, and thought "That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/post_6001764.html |title=Dover Judge Regurgitates Mythological History of Intelligent Design |last=Witt |first=Jonathan |date=December 20, 2005 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=[[Discovery Institute]] |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word "creation," such as "creationism" and "creation science," were changed, almost without exception, to "intelligent design,"&lt;ref name="kitz31"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

''Pandas'' was followed in 1991 by ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'', a neo-creationist [[polemics|polemic]] by Phillip E. Johnson, that is regarded as a central text of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stewart 2007|Stewart 2007]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Darwin on Trial'' mentioned ''Pandas'' as "'creationist' only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of 'intelligent design' with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution," but his use of the term as a focus for his wedge strategy promoting "[[Theistic science#Johnson|theistic realism]]" came later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 2010|Johnson 2010]], pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theistic_realism"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=May–June 1996 |title=Third-Party Science |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/bc/1996/mayjun/6b3030.html |journal=[[Christianity Today|Books &amp; Culture]] |type=Book review |volume=2 |issue=3 |accessdate=December 26, 2013}} Article reprinted in full by [[Access Research Network]] [http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/ratzsch.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] for ''[[Scientific American]]'' in July 1992, concluding that the book contains "...no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points."&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=July 1992 |title=Impeaching a Self-Appointed Judge |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gould_darwin-on-trial.html |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart, Germany |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]] |volume=267 |issue=1 |accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould's review led to the formation in 1992 or 1993 of an 'Ad Hoc Origins Committee' of Johnson's supporters, which wrote a letter, circulated to thousands of university professors, defending the book. Among the 39 signatories were nine who later became members of the [[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] (CRSC).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apologetics.org/news/adhoc.html |title=Ad Hoc Origins Committee: ''Scientists Who Question Darwinism'' |website=Christian Apologetics |publisher=[[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College]] |location=New Port Richey, FL |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s Johnson worked to develop a 'big tent' movement to unify a wide range of creationist viewpoints in opposition to evolution. In 1992, the first formal meeting devoted to intelligent design was held in [[Southern Methodist University]]. It included a debate between Johnson and [[Michael Ruse]] (a key witness in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' (1982)) and papers by [[William A. Dembski]], [[Michael Behe]] and [[Stephen C. Meyer]]. In 1993, Johnson organized a follow-up meeting, including Dembski, Behe, Meyer, [[Dean H. Kenyon]] (co-author of ''Pandas'') and [[Walter Bradley (engineer)|Walter Bradley]] (co-author with Thaxton and Kenyon of ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' (1984)), as well as two graduate students, [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul A. Nelson]] and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture ===
{{main|Center for Science and Culture}}
On December 6, 1993, an article by Meyer was published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', drawing national attention to the controversy over Dean H. Kenyon's teaching of creationism. This article also gained the attention of Discovery Institute co-founder [[Bruce Chapman]]. On discovering that Meyer was developing the idea of starting a scientific research center in conversations with conservative political scientist [[John G. West]], Chapman invited them to create a unit within the Discovery Institute called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (later renamed the Center for Science and Culture). This center was dedicated to overthrowing "[[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]]" and "fomenting nothing less than a scientific and cultural revolution."&lt;ref name="Num381"&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], pp. 381–382&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 conference, "The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture," served as a blueprint for the center.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 they had nearly a million dollars in grants, the largest being from [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]], with smaller but still large contributions coming from the Stewardship Foundation established by C. Davis Weyerhaeuser and the Maclellan Foundation, and appointed their first class of research fellows.&lt;ref name="Num381" /&gt;

=== The wedge strategy ===
{{main|Wedge strategy}}
The wedge strategy was formulated by Phillip E. Johnson to combat the "evil" of [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|methodological naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; It first came to the general public's attention when a Discovery Institute internal memo now known as the "[[Wedge strategy|Wedge Document]]" (believed to have been written in 1998) was leaked to the public in 1999. However it is believed to have been update of an earlier document to be implemented between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], pp. 25–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The document begins with "The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built." and then goes on to outline the movement's goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated "governing goals" of the CSC's wedge strategy are:
:1. To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies
:2. To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God

Critics of intelligent design movement argue that the Wedge Document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute's official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as "irrelevant," "paranoid," and "near-panic" while portraying the Wedge Document as a "fund-raising document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/f/349 |title=The 'Wedge Document': 'So What?' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2003 |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson in his 1997 book ''Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds'' confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement's gainsayers:
{{quotation|If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. With the assistance of many friends I have developed a strategy for doing this,...We call our strategy the "wedge."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 1997|Johnson 1997]], pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Kansas evolution hearings ===
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}
The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], from May 5 to May 12, 2005, by the [[Kansas State Department of Education|Kansas State Board of Education]] and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the [[origin of life]] would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the conservative Board with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the "Teach the Controversy" method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo6.html |title=Kansas Evolution Hearings: Part 6 |date=July 1, 2005 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2005/05/13/kansas_5/ |title=A Real Monkey Trial |last=Dizikes |first=Peter |date=May 13, 2005 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings raised the issues of [[creation and evolution in public education]] and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is purportedly the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.

The Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2112 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Key Resources for Parents and School Board Members |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 7, 2006 |title=Some question group's move with elections nearing |url=http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |work=[[6 News Lawrence|6News Lawrence]] |format=QuickTime |location=Lawrence, KS |publisher=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503093917/http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |archivedate=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local science advocacy group [[Kansas Citizens for Science]] organized a [[boycott]] of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a [[kangaroo court]] and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scholfield |first=Randy |date=March 30, 2005 |title=Scientists right to boycott evolution hearings |url=http://www.kansas.com/mld/eagle/news/editorial/11260641.htm |newspaper=[[The Wichita Eagle]] |type=Editorial |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |page=A6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405050648/http://www.kansas.com/mld/eagle/news/editorial/11260641.htm |archivedate=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}

ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts." At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is "an unproven, often disproven" theory.&lt;ref name="Bailey_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Bailey |date=May 25, 2005 |title=Unintelligent Design |url=http://reason.com/archives/2005/05/25/unintelligent-design |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] |issn=0048-6906 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic," asserted Martin.&lt;ref name="Bailey_2005" /&gt; The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying "Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the [[Scientific method|methods of science]]."&lt;ref name="nas_25" /&gt;

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hanna |first=John |date=February 13, 2007 |title=Evolution of Kansas science standards continues as Darwin's theories regain prominence |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Kansas-Evolution-History.php |newspaper=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]] |location=New York |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525044215/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Kansas-Evolution-History.php |archivedate=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated. Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower.&lt;ref name="Public Divided on Origins of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2005/08/30/public-divided-on-origins-of-life/ |title=Public Divided on Origins of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 30, 2005 |website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it's primarily religion, 93% say there is not "any scientifically valid evidence or an alternate scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principles of the theory of evolution," and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uc.edu/news/idpoll.htm |title=Majority of Ohio Science Professors and Public Agree: 'Intelligent Design' Mostly About Religion |last=Hoffman |first=Carey |date=October 11, 2002 |website=University of Cincinnati |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]] |location=Cincinnati, OH |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2001, the Discovery Institute advertised ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]'' in three national publications (''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''), listing what they claimed were "100 scientific dissenters" who had signed a statement that "We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."&lt;ref name="di_dissent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/sign_the_list.php |title=Sign - Dissent from Darwin |author= |website=dissentfromdarwin.org |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411085856/http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/sign_the_list.php |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards the National Center for Science Education described the wording as misleading, noting that a minority of the signatories were biologists and some of the others were engineers, mathematicians and philosophers, and that some signatories did not fully support the Discovery Institute's claims. The list was further criticized in a February 2006 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' which pointed out that only 25% of the signatories by then were biologists and that signatories' "doubts about evolution grew out of their religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=February 21, 2006 |title=Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, as a humorous parody of such listings the NCSE produced the pro-evolution [[Project Steve]] list of signatories, all with variations of the name Steve and most of whom are trained biologists.

== Structure ==

=== The 'big tent' strategy ===
The movement's strategy as set forth by Phillip E. Johnson states the replacement of "materialist science" with "theistic science" as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become "the dominant perspective in science" and to "permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life." This agenda is now being actively pursued by the Center for Science and Culture, which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: William A. Dembski, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells and Stephen C. Meyer.

Intelligent design has been described by its proponents as a 'big tent' belief, one in which all theists united by having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article in ''Christian Research Journal'', Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the 'big tent' approach and for reviving creationist debate since the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Nelson (creationist) |year=2002 |title=Life In The Big Tent: Traditional Creationism And The Intelligent Design Community |url=http://www.equip.org/PDF/DL303.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Christian Research Journal |location=Charlotte, NC |publisher=[[Christian Research Institute]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |issn=1082-572X |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nelson, "The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians (and others) may disagree amicably, and fruitfully, about how best to understand the natural world, as well as Scripture."

In his presentation to the 1999 "Reclaiming America for Christ Conference," "How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won," Johnson affirmed this 'big tent' role for "The Wedge" (without using the term intelligent design):

{{quotation|To talk of a purposeful or guided evolution is not to talk about evolution at all. That is "slow creation." When you understand it that way, you realize that the Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a Creator brought about our existence for a purpose. That is the first thing I realized, and it carries tremendous meaning.

[...]

So did God create us? Or did we create God? That's an issue that unites people across the theistic world. Even religious, God-believing Jewish people will say, "That's an issue we really have a stake in, so let's debate that question first. Let us settle that question first. There are plenty of other important questions on which we may not agree, and we'll have a wonderful time discussing those questions after we've settled the first one. We will approach those questions in a better spirit because we have worked together for this important common end."

[...]

[The Wedge is] inherently an ecumenical movement. Michael Behe is a Roman Catholic. The next book that is coming out from Cambridge University Press by one of my close associates is by an evangelical convert to Greek Orthodoxy. We have a lot of Protestants, too. The point is that we have this broad-based intellectual movement that is enabling us to get a foothold in the scientific and academic journals and in the journals of the various religious faiths.|Johnson|How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won&lt;ref name="debate_won"/&gt;}}

The Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ''[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]]'' asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying "I don't think we want to go down that path."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 9, 2005 |title=Small Group Wields Major Influence in Intelligent Design Debate |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1297170&amp;WNT=true |work=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |location=New York |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obfuscation of religious motivation ===
Phillip E. Johnson, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a "theistic realist" against "methodological naturalism" and intelligent design as the method through which God created [[life]].&lt;ref name="johnson_theistic_realist"&gt;[[#Johnson 1995|Johnson 1995]], pp. 208-209. "A theistic realist assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God. Theistic realists expect this 'fact' of creation to have empirical, observable consequences that are different from the consequences one would observe if the universe were the product of nonrational causes... God always has the option of working through regular secondary mechanisms, and we observe such mechanisms frequently. On the other hand, many important questions—including the origin of genetic information and human consciousness—may not be explicable in terms of unintelligent causes, just as a computer or a book cannot be explained that way."&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized "as just another way of packaging the [[Evangelicalism|Christian evangelical message]]."&lt;ref name="johnson_evangelical_message"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=April 1999 |title=Keeping the Darwinists Honest |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/citmag99.htm |journal=Citizen |location=Colorado Springs, CO |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |issn=1084-6832 |accessdate=2014-06-01 |quote="ID is an intellectual movement, and the Wedge strategy stops working when we are seen as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message. [...] The evangelists do what they do very well, and I hope our work opens up for them some doors that have been closed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of [[theism|theistic]] [[creationism]] is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes "the first thing that has to be done is to get the [[Bible]] out of the discussion" and that "after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact" only then can "biblical issues" be discussed.&lt;ref name="johnson_bible_out"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=July–August 1999 |title=The Wedge: Breaking the Modernist Monopoly on Science |url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=12-04-018-f |journal=[[Touchstone Magazine|Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity]] |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Fellowship of St. James |volume=12 |issue=4 |issn=0897-327X |accessdate=2014-06-01 |quote="...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword to ''Creation, Evolution, &amp; Modern Science'' (2000) Johnson writes "The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that 'In the beginning was the Word,' and 'In the beginning God created.' Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bohlin 2000|Bohlin 2000]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Center for Science and Culture ====
{{Main|Center for Science and Culture}}
The Center for Science and Culture, formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Center consists of a tightly knit core of people who have worked together for almost a decade to advance intelligent design as both a concept and a movement as necessary adjuncts of its wedge strategy policy. This cadre includes Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer. They are united by a religious vision which, although it varies among the members in its particulars and is seldom acknowledged outside of the Christian press, is predicated on the shared conviction that America is in need of "renewal" which can be accomplished only by unseating "Godless" materialism and instituting religion as its cultural foundation.

In his keynote address at the "Research and Progress in intelligent design" (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at [[Biola University]], William A. Dembski described intelligent design's "dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance." In a similar vein, the movement's hub, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture had until 2002 been the "''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture''." Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians.

Critics of the movement cite the Wedge Document as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement's leaders, particularly Phillip E. Johnson, view the subject as a [[culture war]]: "Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story. ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind of conflict that is known as a 'culture war.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 1995|Johnson 1995]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cpq97VuAAJEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Center for Science and Culture's has moderated its previous overtly theistic mission statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |title=What is The Center for the Renewal of Science &amp; Culture All About? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970608130849/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |archivedate=1997-06-08 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to appeal to a broader, a more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/aboutCSC.php |title=CSC - About CSC |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the "unscientific principle of materialism," and in particular the acceptance of what it calls "the scientific theory of intelligent design."

Promotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.|Ahmanson]] family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to "unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy."&lt;ref name="Reason_Olson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Olson |date=January 1999 |title=Dark Bedfellows: Postmoderns and Traditionalists Unite Against the Enlightenment |url=http://dheise.andrews.edu/Content/leadership/comps/6a/1educ_fndns/freed_readings/educ632_2.6.htm |journal=Reason |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=Reason Foundation |issn=0048-6906 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the [[Christian right|Christian religious right]], including [[Christian Reconstructionism]], whose goal is to place the [[United States|US]] "under the control of biblical law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/01/06/ahmanson/ |title=Avenging angel of the religious right |last=Blumenthal |first=Max |authorlink=Max Blumenthal |date=January 6, 2004 |website=Salon |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian Reconstructionist [[Chalcedon Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarkson |first=Frederick |authorlink=Frederick Clarkson |date=March–June 1994 |title=Christian Reconstructionism: Part 3: No Longer Without Sheep |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre3.html |journal=[[Public Eye Magazine|The Public Eye]] |location=Somerville, MA |publisher=[[Political Research Associates]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |issn=0275-9322 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
The intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a public relations campaign meant to influence the popular [[Mass media|media]] and sway [[opinion of the public|public opinion]]; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to [[grassroots]] levels. The movement's first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of [[Creation and evolution in public education|evolution in public school science]]; its long-term goal is no less than the "renewal" of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: "Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."

The Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris poll]] identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that "human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them." (64% agreed with the creationist view that "human beings were created directly by God" and 22% believed that "human beings evolved from earlier species." 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |title=Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 2005 |website=The Harris Poll |publisher=[[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] |location=Rochester, NY |id=#52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |archivedate=2005-12-17 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.&lt;ref name="Polling_for_ID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |title=Polling for ID |last=Mooney |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Mooney (journalist) |date=September 11, 2003 |website=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |location=Amherst, NY |type=Blog |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203135805/http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |archivedate=2007-02-03 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, [[neo-creationism]], a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in United States federal court that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', [[United States district court|United States District Judge]] [[John E. Jones III]] [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|also ruled]] that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.

In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Aralene Callahan"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of ''teaching the controversy'' - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution.

=== Campaigns ===
{{Main|Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns}}
The Discovery Institute, through its Center for Science and Culture, has formulated a number of campaigns to promote intelligent design, while discrediting [[evolutionary biology]], which the Institute terms "[[Darwinism]]."&lt;ref name="ForrestMay2007Paper" /&gt;

Prominent Institute campaigns have been to "Teach the Controversy" and, more recently, to allow Critical Analysis of Evolution. Other prominent campaigns have claimed that intelligent design advocates (most notably [[Richard Sternberg]]) have been discriminated against, and thus that [[Academic Freedom bills]] are needed to protect academics' and teachers' ability to criticise evolution, and that there is a link from evolution to ideologies such as [[Nazism]] and [[eugenics]]. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' (2008). Other campaigns have included petitions, most notably ''A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism''.

The response of the scientific community has been to reiterate that the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of [[scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |date=July 28, 2006 |title=Finding the Evolution in Medicine |url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |journal=[[NIH Record]] |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]; [[National Institutes of Health]] |issn=1057-5871 |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df= }} "...While 99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution, 40 to 50 percent of college students do not accept evolution and believe it to be 'just' a theory." — [[Brian Alters]]&lt;/ref&gt;  whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community (see [[list of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design]]).

=== Politics and public education ===
{{main|Intelligent design in politics|creation and evolution in public education}}
The main battlefield for this culture war has been US regional and state [[Board of education|school boards]]. [[Court]]s have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in public school science curricula are challenged on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyle |first1=Tara |last2=Farden |first2=Vicki |last3=Godoy |first3=Maria |date=December 20, 2005 |title=Teaching Evolution: A State-by-State Debate |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4630737 |work=[[NPR]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Public Radio, Inc. |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', the plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Intelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/rdrenka/Renka_papers/intell_design.htm |title=The Political Design of Intelligent Design |last=Renka |first=Russell D. |date=November 16, 2005 |website=Renka's Home Page |location=Round Rock, TX |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though numerically a minority of Americans,.&lt;ref name="Public Divided on Origins of Life" /&gt; the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy public relations campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slevin |first=Peter |date=March 14, 2005 |title=Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=Washington, D.C. |page=A01 |accessdate=2014-06-03 |quote=In Seattle, the nonprofit Discovery Institute spends more than $1 million a year for research, polls and media pieces supporting intelligent design.}}
* [[#Wilgoren 2005|Wilgoren 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities.

With a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream  science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not "in crisis" or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim,&lt;ref name="top_issues"&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Schmid |first1=Julie |last2=Knight |first2=Jonathan |date=June 17, 2005 |title=Faculty Association Speaks Out on Three Top Issues |url=http://www.aaup.org/newsroom/press/2005/amres.htm |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210021246/http://www.aaup.org/newsroom/press/2005/amres.htm |archivedate=2006-02-10 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "teaching the controversy" is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Aralene Callahan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Julie Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 130 of 139|6:Curriculum, Conclusion, pp. 129–130]]. "Moreover, Board members and teachers opposing the curriculum change and its implementation have been confronted directly. First, Casey Brown testified that following her opposition to the curriculum change on October 18, 2004, Buckingham called her an atheist and Bonsell told her that she would go to hell. Second, Angie Yingling was coerced into voting for the curriculum change by Board members accusing her of being an atheist and un- Christian. In addition, both Bryan Rehm and Fred Callahan have been confronted in similarly hostile ways, as have teachers in the DASD."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a round table discussion entitled "Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/events/2005/10/21/science-wars-event/ |title=Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design? |date=October 21, 2005 |publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Conference |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] on 21 October 2005 and televised on [[C-SPAN]], the Discovery Institute's Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center's Richard Thompson had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the Institute's leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the Institute's calls for action.&lt;ref name="InstituteandThomasSquabble"/&gt; As evidence, Thompson cited the Discovery Institute's guidebook ''Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula'' written by the Institute's co-founder and first director, Stephen C. Meyer, and David K. DeWolf, a CSC Fellow, which stated in its closing paragraphs: "Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as ''Of Pandas and People'' that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeWolf, Meyer, &amp; DeForrest 1999|DeWolf, Meyer, &amp; DeForrest 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
In 1999, William A. Dembski was invited by [[Baylor University]] president [[Robert B. Sloan]] to form the [[Michael Polanyi Center]], described by Dembski as "the first Intelligent Design think tank at a research university." Its creation was controversial with Baylor faculty, and in 2000 it was merged with the Institute for Faith and Learning. Dembski, although remaining as a research professor until 2005, was given no courses to teach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phy-Olsen 2010|Phy-Olsen 2010]], pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Two universities have offered courses in intelligent design: [[Oklahoma Baptist University]], where ID advocate Michael Newton Keas taught 'Unified Studies: Introduction to Biology,' and [[Biola University]], host of the [[Mere Creation]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, numerous Christian evangelical institutions have faculty with interests in intelligent design. These include [[Oral Roberts University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/academics/faculty_profile.php?id=61 |title=Dr. William Collier |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Oral Roberts University |location=Tulsa, OK |publisher=[[Oral Roberts University]] |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swbts.edu/academics/faculty/college/michael-n-keas/ |title=Michael N.

In 2005, the [[American Association of University Professors]] issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars, and deploring requirements "to make students aware of an 'intelligent-design hypothesis' to account for the origins of life." It said that such requirements are "inimical to principles of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="top_issues" /&gt;

=== The Web ===

Much of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled. In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic [[Taner Edis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Young &amp; Edis 2004|Young &amp; Edis 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement lacks any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles.&lt;ref name="Forrest_2001" /&gt;

The Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute's strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the Center's ''Evolution News &amp; Views'' blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled "Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries." In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that Wikipedia's coverage of ID to be "one sided" and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers "to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/wikipedia_youre_on_notice002574.html |title=Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries |last=Luskin |first=Casey |date=September 6, 2006 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
Despite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro-intelligent design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the [[United Kingdom]], the group [[Truth in Science]] has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=November 26, 2006 |title=Revealed: rise of creationism in UK schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/27/controversiesinscience.religion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=December 6, 2006 |title=Ministers to ban creationist teaching aids in science lessons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/07/schools.religion |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of the movement ==
One of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership is that of [[intellectual dishonesty]], in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional [[ambiguity]], and misrepresented evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenhouse |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Rosenhouse |date=January 2003 |title=Leaders and Followers in the Intelligent-Design Movement |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/6.full |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0006:LAFITI]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |quote=ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as [[Eugenie Scott]], [[Robert T. Pennock]] and [[Barbara Forrest]], claim that leaders of the intelligent design movement, and the Discovery Institute in particular, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through [[ellipsis]], and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Theologian and molecular biophysicist [[Alister McGrath]] has a number of criticisms of the Intelligent design movement, stating that "those who adopt this approach make Christianity deeply... vulnerable to scientific progress" and defining it as just another "[[God of the gaps|god-of-the-gaps]]" theory. He went on to criticize the movement on theological grounds as well, stating "It is not an approach I accept, either on scientific or theological grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath &amp; McGrath 2007|McGrath &amp; McGrath 2007]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the [[University of Texas at Dallas|University of Texas]], [[Ohio University]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], respectively, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: ''Probe Ministries'' for Bohlin, ''[[Reasons To Believe|Reasons to Believe]]'' ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute's ''Center for Science and Culture'' for Wells. Similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated during controversies over evolution education in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Mexico]], [[Ohio]], and [[Texas]]. In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the [[Nobel Prize]] in connection with [[Henry F. Schaefer, III]], a CSC Fellow, and chemist at the [[University of Georgia]]. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a "five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize" because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.

This criticism is not reserved only to the Institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege William A. Dembski gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]], bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'', [[Philosophical Library]], also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an ''amicus curiae'' brief that noted that the "evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept."&lt;ref name="Edwards_v_Aguillard_amicus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard: U.S. Supreme Court Decision |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don't support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they've written for their own purposes.

[[Sahotra Sarkar]], a [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, have misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional [[malfeasance]]:

{{quotation|"When testifying before the Texas State Board of Education in 2003 (in a battle over textbook adoption that we won hands down), I claimed that my work had been maliciously misused by members of the Discovery Institute. ... The trouble is that it says nothing of the sort that Meyer claims. I don't mention Dembski, ID, or "intelligent" information whatever that may be. I don't talk about assembly instructions. In fact what the paper essentially does is question the value of informational notions altogether, which made many molecular biologists unhappy, but which is also diametrically opposed to the "complex specified information" project of the ID creationists. ... Notice how my work is being presented as being in concordance with ID when Meyer knows very well where I stand on this issue. If Meyer were an academic, this kind of malfeasance would rightly earn him professional censure. Unfortunlately he's not. He's only the Director of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture."|Sahotra Sarkar|Fraud from the Discovery Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/003383.html |title=Fraud from the Discovery Institute |last=Sarkar |first=Sahotra |authorlink=Sahotra Sarkar |date=December 3, 2005 |website=Sarkar Lab WebLog |type=Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806005117/http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/003383.html |archivedate=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An October 2005 conference called "When Christians and Cultures Clash" was held in Christ Hall at [[Evangelical Seminary|Evangelical School of Theology]] in [[Myerstown, Pennsylvania]]. Attorney Randall L. Wenger, who is affiliated with the Alliance Defense Fund, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of subterfuge for advancing the movement's religious goals: "But even with God's blessing, it's helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle... For instance, the Dover area school board might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings... Give us a call before you do something controversial like that... I think we need to do a better job at being clever as serpents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke |first=Daniel |date=October 20, 2005 |title="Bring us your legal issues," clergy told |url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/bring-us-your-legal-issues-clergy-told/article_8db31e2c-b983-5fc6-a642-6060f0964230.html?mode=jqm |newspaper=[[Lancaster Newspapers, Inc.|Lancaster New Era]] |location=Lancaster, PA |accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes:'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idenetwork.org/idec/idec-english.htm IDEN: IDEC : International Democratic Education Conference general information]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''IDEC 2001:'' The conference was to be held jointly and co-hosted by the Institute of Democratic Education in Israel and the Hope Flowers School in Palestine, but the international situation reduced it to a comparatively small event, attended mainly by Israelis, Palestinians and Germans; for that situation they was decided to call this conference the “Israeli Democratic Education Conference”.
* ''IDEC 2009:'' The conference was cancelled due to [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://2009.e-idec.org/en/node/126 Notice | IDEC 2009 KOREA] official website. Retrieved 9/10/09.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''IDEC 2012:'' For the very first time, the IDEC conference will be held in the Caribbean at [[Puerto Rico]], a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] ([[unincorporated territory]]) of the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''Jenaplan (or Jena Plan) [[school]]s''' are based on a teaching concept conceived and founded by the [[Germany|German]] [[pedagogy|pedagogue]] [[Peter Petersen (pedagogue)|Peter Petersen]] from 1923-1927.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dibb.de/petersen-jena-plan-schule.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Boes: Jenaplan: Historie en actualiteit (in Dutch), Wolters-Noordhoff, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The term Jenaplan was coined by the [[London]] committee for preparing the 4th meeting of the [[‘’New Education Fellowship’’]]  in [[Locarno]] in 1927. Petersen developed his concept at the [[University of Jena]] (hence the term), where he was the head of the Department of Education since 1923.

The basic ideas are: independent learning by doing, [[cooperation]] and communal life, shared responsibility by school [[child]]ren and [[parent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Janina Neumann: Jenaplan: Ein reformpädagogisches Konzept und sein Potential für den Bereich DaF. AV Akademikerverlag, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The basic forms of education according to the Jenaplan approach are:

* Teaching: (interdisciplinary) core teaching, free work (free choice of discipline), course teaching (in special disciplines)
* Party and celebrations: morning circle, week closure celebrations, birthday parties, enrollment and others
* Discussions: round-tables, reports, talks, clarifying debates etc.
* Play (free play, learning games, pause games, gymnastics games, theatre play): this supports the development of younger children, teaches rules for social behaviour, promotes attention

The Jenaplan schools operate according to 20 basic [[principle]]s, e.g.:
* Each human being is unique. Therefore, each child and each adult has an irreplaceable value and a special [[dignity]].
* Each human being has the right to develop his/her own [[Identity (social science)|identity]], irrespective of [[ethnic origin]], [[nationality]], [[social environment]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]] or abilities/[[disability|disabilities]].
* Every person is always recognized in his/her entirety. S/he is encountered and treated in this way, wherever possible.
* People should work for a society that respects the irreplaceable value and the dignity of every individual human being.
* People should work for a society that offers the opportunity and incentives for developing the identity of each person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7255">'''Language learning aptitude''' refers to the "prediction of how well, relative to other individuals, an individual can learn a [[foreign language]] in a given amount of time and under given conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield, Charles W. "Language Aptitude Reconsidered." ''ERIC Digest''. Washington DC: ERIC Clearinghouse on Languages and Linguistics, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many measures of aptitude, language learning aptitude is thought to be relatively stable once a person matures. Many people show a remarkable learning aptitude for learning their language.

== Language learning disability ==

Some high schools, universities or other institutions will interpret low language learning aptitude as a sign of a language learning disability.  A pattern of evidence from several sources can help to diagnose a foreign language learning disability.  Evidence can come from scoring poorly on language learning aptitude assessments, like the [[Modern Language Aptitude Test]], [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]], [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary]] or [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], while attaining average or above-average scores on aptitude assessments in other areas, like general intelligence.  A history of scoring poorly on an array of language aptitude tests taken at the appropriate time ([[Modern Language Aptitude Test#Modern Language Aptitude Test – Elementary|MLAT-E]] for grades 3–6, [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery|PLAB]] for grades 7–12, [[Modern Language Aptitude Test|MLAT]] for adults) can provide even stronger evidence for a language learning disability.  Evidence can also come from comparing a poor past performance in foreign language courses with average or above-average performance in other courses unrelated to language learning.

Language aptitude is one of the important factors that determined L2 later learners' ultimate achievement, but it has less effect on L2 early learners.&lt;ref&gt; Ortega, L. (2013). Understanding second language acquisition. London : Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== John B. Carroll ==

[[John B. Carroll]], an influential psychologist in the field of educational linguistics, developed a theory about a cluster of four abilities that factored into language learning aptitude, separate from verbal intelligence and motivation.  Using these four distinct abilities (phonetic coding ability, grammatical sensitivity, rote learning ability, and inductive learning ability), Carroll developed the MLAT, a language aptitude assessment for adults.

The four ability components are defined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Component
!Definition
|-
|Phonetic coding ability
|ability to perceive distinct sounds, associate a symbol with that sound and retain that association
|-
|Grammatical memory
| ability to recognize the grammatical function of a lexical element (word, phrase, etc.) in a sentence without explicit training in grammar
|-
|Associative memory
| ability to learn associations between words in a foreign language and their meanings and retain that association
|-
|Inductive learning ability
| ability to infer or induce rules governing the structure of a language
|}

== Paul Pimsleur ==

[[Paul Pimsleur]], also known for the [[Pimsleur language learning system]], spent time researching four factors that he believed to be related to language learning aptitude.  Pimsleur included grade point average as an indication of general academic achievement as well as motivation in his factors.  In addition, the verbal ability factor indicated how well a student would be able to handle the mechanics of learning a foreign language and the auditory factor indicated how well a student would be able to listen to and produce phrases in a foreign language.  To test these four factors, Pimsleur developed the [[Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery]].

== Uses of aptitude measurement ==

Measurements of language learning aptitude are used in many different ways.  The United States Department of Defense uses a measurement of language learning aptitude, the [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]], to help place employees in positions that require them to learn a new language.

Governmental agencies use the MLAT as a tool to select and place employees in intensive language training programs.  Businesses and missionaries use the MLAT to select, place and plan for language training.  Universities, colleges and high schools use the MLAT to help in the diagnosis of foreign language learning disabilities.  Although each institution has its own policy, many will waive a foreign language requirement in cases of a foreign language learning disability in favor of a history or linguistic course.

Schools use the PLAB and MLAT-E to place students in suitable language courses, build a history of a foreign language learning difficulty, identify especially gifted students in respect to language learning and to match learning styles with instructional styles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17259">'''Living educational theory''' ('''LET''') is a research method in educational research.

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)
# I develop a solution to transform and improve myself, influence the transformation and improvement of the fellow human beings with whom I interact and the social and work places I share with people.
# I enact [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in the direction of the solution I developed from a [[critical theory]] perspective.
# I evaluate the pragmatic outcomes of the solution based on the Hallmarks of Learning {{harv|Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|2005}} and the implications from a holistic psychological perspective including [[transpersonal psychology]].
# I modify my use of power, pedagogy, valid and reliable [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and leadership to maximize social justice, ethical processes and results, and improve performance and knowledge as a result of my emerging living educational theory (LET) (Synthesis). As an iterative process, I start the cycle again within reasonable time constraints.

'''''Lottovoittaja UKK Turhapuro''''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] 1976 comedy film written by [[Spede Pasanen]] and directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]]. It is the third film in the [[Uuno Turhapuro]] series. The film's title translates to "Lottery winner UKK Turhapuro", UKK being an apparent reference to former President of Finland [[Urho Kekkonen]].

==Plot==

It is the first anniversary of Uuno ([[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]) and Elisabet ([[Marjatta Raita]]). Uuno has placed a bet with his friend Härski-Hartikainen ([[Spede Pasanen]]) a year ago, that if Uuno can take just one year of marriage with Elisabet, Hartikainen will treat him a festive dinner. However, Hartikainen buys a lottery ticket for Uuno, who agrees to deduct it from his debt &amp;ndash; and the festive dinner is reduced to a can of milk and half a sausage. As it happens, Uuno becomes the lottery winner of 1.5 million [[Finnish mark|marks]], only to soon realize he doesn't own a single penny yet. Mister Tossavainen ([[Seppo Laine]]) arrives and offers to finance Uuno before he actually gets the jackpot. Thus, Uuno gets to live a rich live on credit. He buys a raccoon fur, leopard swimming trunks and a couple of [[Mercedes-Benz]]es. Women begin to fancy Uuno and so does his [[Councillor Tuura|father-in-law]] ([[Tapio Hämäläinen]]). As time goes by it is revealed, though, that Uuno is not actually a lottery winner, and so he has to escape the anger of others to Härski's car repair shop.

It was designed to be the bridge between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, allowing employees to continue advancing their education without affecting their employment and personal commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/micromasters-degree-4149968|title=MicroMasters: The Bridge Between a Bachelor’s Degree and a Graduate Degree|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2017-11-19|website=ThoughtCo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First launched in September 2016 with 19 MicroMasters programs as an extension of its [[Mooc|MOOC]], edX eventually expanded to include 17 additional programs in February 2017. As of November 2018, 51 different MicroMasters programs are being offered, with 47 in English, 3 in Spanish, and 1 in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/micromasters|title=MicroMasters Programs {{!}} edX|date=2016-08-15|work=edX|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MicroMasters program is sponsored by at least one industry partner, including [[General Electric|GE]], [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Hootsuite]], [[Fidelity International|Fidelity]], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Walmart]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PWC]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz-Allen Hamilton]], and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2018/02/13/voice-of-employers-rings-out-as-moocs-go-from-education-to-qualification/#39c0fc72564b|title='MicroMasters' Surge As MOOCs Go From Education To Qualification|last=Gordon|first=Adam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to bridge the gap between job candidates with a bachelor's degree and companies that want employees with an advanced degree by offering credentials that are equivalent to 25 to 50 percent of a master's degree or 20 to 30 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodcall.com/news/micromasters-next-stop-graduate-degrees-09048|title=MicroMasters: The Next Big Thing After a Bachelor’s Degree?|last=Williams|first=Terri|date=2016-10-21|website=GoodCall|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other existing microcredentials, the MicroMasters programs offer both the benefit of gaining relevant skills in a particular field that can support career development and a pathway to advanced credits in the respective universities offering the course. This includes many of the top universities in the world such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Indian Institutes of Management|Indian Institute of Management]]. The idea of the MicroMasters program started out as an iteration of the existing MOOC model when [[Coursera]] first started offering specializations for its various disciplines and a response to the changing nature of work as well as the [[Skills mismatch|major skills shortage]] currently impacting businesses around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/reflecting-original-big-idea-moocs|title=Reflecting on the Original Big Idea for MOOCs {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|website=www.insidehighered.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Structure ==

=== Prerequisites ===
All MicroMasters programs are currently running on the edX MOOC platform, where learners are free to audit any of the courses. Depending on the program, there are prerequisites ranging from graduate level understanding of various specific disciplines or work experienced. However, these prerequisites serve as recommended guidelines for the learners rather than a strictly enforced rule so there are no specific degree requirements for any of the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/14/skip-college-and-go-to-graduate-school-with-new-mit-program.html|title=Here's how to skip college and go straight to grad school—at MIT|last=Montag|first=Ali|date=2017-07-14|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, learners will have to pay if they wish to pursue a verified certificate.

=== Certification ===
To qualify for a certificate for successfully completing a MicroMasters Program, all learners are required to complete a series of [[Interactive course|interactive courses]] as specified in the respective MicroMasters program and achieve a minimum grade according to the institution awarding the certification.  

For learners interested in developing skills for professional advancement, the certificate for completing a MicroMasters Program may be sufficient.

=== Continuing Education ===
For learners interested in academic credit, the learner must be admitted into the university's respective master's program. Some programs, such as the MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management by MIT also operate on a [[blended learning]] model which include a timed examination as well as a final proctored examination. Admission requirements for its on-campus blended learning program differ from its traditional residential admission requirements as applicants are not required to submit scores in a [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] or [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] as performance in the Micromasters program will be taken as a substitute for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scm.mit.edu/blended-admissions|title=SCMb Masters Degree Admissions {{!}} MIT Supply Chain Management|website=scm.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other programs still follow usual admission guidelines and the MicroMasters program has little to no impact on their application apart from receiving advanced credits upon admission into its respective programs. Generally, most courses include practice exercises which are ungraded as well as graded assignments with limited attempts.

The following is a list of the current MicroMasters programs offered as well as the respective graduate degree options available for each program upon graduation of the MicroMasters program.

[[File:BeethovenSymponyNo5.JPG|thumb|[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], music sheet released by the Mutopia Project]]
The '''Mutopia Project''' is a volunteer-run effort to create a library of [[free content]] [[sheet music]], in a way similar to [[Project Gutenberg]]'s library of public domain books.  It started in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; Portal page at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20010123221500/http://www.mutopiaproject.org/index.html Internet Archive] Retrieved January 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music is reproduced from old scores that are in the [[public domain]]. New scores are [[Music engraving#Computer music engraving|digitally typeset]] with [[LilyPond|GNU LilyPond]] and distributed in the following formats:
* [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] in both [[Letter (paper size)|letter]] and [[A4 paper#A series|A4]] paper sizes for printing,

'''The North of England Education Conference (NEEC)''' was the UK’s biggest annual education conference. The first Conference took place in [[Manchester]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL20289314M/North_of_England_education_conference_1902-1992 "A history of the NEEC Conference 1902 -1992"] Professor Peter Osgood, Leeds University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The event provided an opportunity for senior decision makers in education, Children’s Services, the public sector, associated agencies and organisations to meet and consider the latest thinking and legislation affecting children and young people. In recent years the scope of the conference had expanded to encompass the broader children’s services agenda.

Despite the conference name, delegates attended from across the UK and beyond. In recent years the conference took place outside of the North of England, including [[Belfast]] and [[Cardiff]].
In 2015 the conference was to be hosted in [http://www.educationconferences.co.uk Manchester] between 14–16 January but was cancelled and has not been held since.
==Delegates==

Within recent years the focus of the conference had expanded. Whilst still having education at its core, a broader children’s agenda was embraced.  Attendees included Directors of Education, key elected members, headteachers, school governors, those engaged in research in Higher Education and partners from Health, Police and Voluntary Sector organisations.

==Speakers==

The conference attracted high-profile speakers and notably the appropriate Secretary of State. This has included in recent years [[Ed Balls]], [[Ruth Kelly]], [[David Miliband]], [[David Blunkett]] and [[Estelle Morris]]. The conference was often used as a platform to launch or 'sound out' changes in policy or legislation. Hosting authorities often worked in collaboration with local universities and colleges to tap into national and international expertise and research.

==Venues==

Historically the Conference has taken place each January and has alternated in venue between the east and west of the [[Pennines]]. On occasion however, the Conference has been held outside the North of England. In 2004 the NEEC was held in [[Northern Ireland]] in [[Belfast]] and in 2008, the NEEC paid its first visit to [[Wales]] and [[Cardiff]].  In January 2014 the last conference was held in [[Nottingham]]. 

==Development==

Reflecting changes in recent years in the delivery of services to children, young people and families the conference focus had begun to reflect the wider children’s agenda encapsulated in ''[[Every Child Matters|Every Child Matters: Change for Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ "Every Child Matters Agenda"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101220152656/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ |date=20 December 2010 }}  Labour Government Paper enshrining the Children Act 2004 (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the conference continued to provide high-profile speakers with an education focus, it had recently included speakers from other areas of the children’s workforce such as health, the police, business and the [[Voluntary sector|Third Sector]]. However the event, which generations of education policymakers viewed as a key moment of the year, now appears to be a thing of the past and by the time Michael Gove took over as education secretary in 2010, it was an event he was quite happy to miss, choosing to make major announcements elsewhere. No minister was due to appear in 2015.

==Governance==

The NEEC operated under the governance formed by its membership as part of the North of England Education Conference Association. This is defined as ''"Those English Local Authorities within the Government Office areas for the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, and also the higher education institutions lying in this area".'' Representatives from the host authority, their predecessor and the following years host were represented in the governance.

==Involvement of children and young people==

A strong feature of the conference is the involvement of children and young people. Traditionally involved in artistic, musical and dramatic performance they had begun to play a wider role in the content of the programme. In January 2012 Blackpool had a young person co-preside over the conference for the first time along with President, [[Ann Widdecombe]]. In [[Nottingham]] in 2014 there was a separate Youth Conference running alongside the main event run by young people from the eight Core Cities.

==History of the Conference==

In 1902, having seen the success of a conference for science teachers in London,  JH Reynolds, Manchester City Council's Director of Technical Instruction, decided to replicate the conference in his home town. The conference, also with a science theme, was arranged for 2 and 3 January 1903 and attended by 3,200 teachers, lecturers, inspectors and local government employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=373229 "Best wishes to our friend in the North"] Times Educational Supplement, 3 January 2003, Alison Brace - Article on the History of the NEEC on its 100th anniversary (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Built on this success the conference widened the agenda to cover all areas of the curriculum. With short input from a range of professionals the, conference has remained true to the original template and remained a fixture in the first week of the year.
 
In 1924 the political dimension was added and the Secretary of the State of the day has usually been in attendance ever since, the conference often serving as a platform for announcement to changes in legislation or educational approaches. Over the course of its history this has included: [[Anthony Crosland]], [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102083 "Speech to North of England Education Conference"], 6 Jan 1971, Margaret Thatcher&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Clarke, on assuming his post as Secretary of State, is reported to have been told it was the one conference he could not afford to miss.

'''One-room schools''' were commonplace throughout [[rural]] portions of various [[countries]], including [[Prussia]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Spain]]. In most rural (country) and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single [[teacher]] taught academic basics to several grade levels of [[primary education|elementary-age]] boys and girls. While in many areas one-room schools are no longer used, it is not uncommon for them to remain in [[developing nation]]s and rural or remote areas. Examples include remote parts of the [[Western United States|American West]], the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]], and the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]].

==Prussia==

[[File:Schulmuseum Reckahn 085.jpg|thumb|The one-room school in Reckahn, [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], was founded 1773 and quotes Mark 10:14 at the entrance. It is now used as a local history museum.]]
Prussia (compare [[Prussian education system]]) was among the first countries in the world to introduce a tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education for either boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;James van Horn Melton, ''Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, compulsory schooling in France or Great Britain was not successfully enacted until the 1880s.&lt;ref name =says&gt;Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal and David Strang, Sociology of Education, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 277-288 Published by: American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt; The state sponsored system was introduced in the late 18th century and has had widespread influences since. The first Prussian schools were simple one-room schools, however already as of 1773 Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow set up a model school with primary education in two age related [[Form (education)|classes]].

==Ireland==

In [[Ireland]], free primary education was mandated in 1931, prompting the establishment of many single-teacher [[National school (Ireland)|National School]]s across rural areas, most initially using a room in an existing building.  By the 1890s there was a school in every [[parish]].  Most extant one- and two-room school buildings date from the decades after 1891 when primary education became compulsory.  Most of those still in use today have been extended following merger with neighbouring schools.  Since 2002, any state-funded school with at least 10 pupils is entitled to at least 2 teachers; the 21 schools which fell below this threshold are located on [[List of islands of Ireland|offshore islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?pcategory=17241&amp;ecategory=17241&amp;language=EN |title=Key Statistics about the Department's Customers |work=Department of Education and Skills |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, an increasing number of schools have been founded for parents not content with the National School system.  These include ''[[Gaelscoil]]eanna'' (which teach through [[Irish language|Irish]] rather than [[English language|English]]) and multi-denominational schools (most Irish schools are controlled by one or other of the [[Culture of Ireland#Religion|main Christian churches]]). Although such schools eventually become eligible for state funding, they usually begin with a single teacher in a room or [[prefabricated building|prefabricated]] building.

==United States==

Many schools also served as the local chapel on Sundays, and evening/Saturday meeting places for local people and activities. Being mostly rural, many schools had no water or sanitation and this was often provided by converting wells into toilets{{fact|date=June 2015}}, melting snow for water in the winter and relying on the help of nearby farms in the summer. 

Teaching standards often varied from school to school as the teacher was compelled to coach children of all ages/grades within one room and regardless of their area of main competence.

The quality of facilities at one-room schools varied with local economic conditions, but generally, the number of children at each grade level would vary with local populations. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, some with the school bell on a [[cupola]]. In the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[sod]] construction was also used, as well as stone and [[adobe]] in areas like the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] where trees were scarce. In some locations, the schoolhouse was painted red, but most seem to have been white. 
[[File:One-room School Waverly Historic District Waverly PA Oct 09.jpg|thumb|A historic one-room school in [[Waverly, Pennsylvania]].]]
Mission Ridge School was one of the early schools in [[Mason County, West Virginia]]. It has since been moved to the West Virginia State Farm Museum complex near [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]]. Examination of the materials in this building indicates that boards and timbers were hand-sawed and also hand-planed. Square nails were used throughout the building. Except for the roof and a few boards in the floor, all of the material in this building is original. The [[Chalkboard|blackboard]] is painted black. It was not until much later that slate was used for chalkboards, although students often had individual slates for writing practice.

Teachers in one-room schools were often former students themselves. Their role is well-described by a student from [[Kentucky]] in the 1940s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The teachers that taught in the one room, rural schools were very special people. During the winter months they would get to the school early to get a fire started in the [[potbelly stove]], so the building would be warm for the students. On many occasions they would prepare a hot, noon meal on top of the stove, usually consisting of soup or stew of some kind. They took care of their students like a new mother hen would care for her newly hatched chicks; always looking out for their health and welfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A typical school day was 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with morning and afternoon [[recess (break)|recesses]] of 15 minutes each and an hour period for lunch. "The older students were given the responsibility of bringing in water, carrying in coal or wood for the stove. The younger students would be given responsibilities according to their size and gender such as cleaning the black board (chalkboard), taking the erasers outside for dusting plus other duties that they were capable of doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snowkentucky.com/one_room_school.htm |work=snowkentucky.com |title=One Room School |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003174603/http://www.snowkentucky.com/one_room_school.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation for children who lived too far to walk was often provided by [[horse]]-drawn [[kid hack]] or [[sulky]], which could only travel a limited distance in a reasonable amount of time each morning and evening, or students might ride a [[horse]], these being put out to pasture in an adjoining paddock during the day. In more recent times, students rode [[bicycle]]s.

The school house was the center and focus for thousands of rural communities, hamlets, and small towns. Often, town meetings and picnics were also held there. 

The vast majority of one-room schools in the United States are no longer used as schools and have either been torn down or converted for other purposes.  However, in some rural communities, including among the [[Amish]], one-room or two-room schools are still used, primarily for [[elementary education]], with students graduating to local or regional middle and high schools.

There are several historic one-room schoolhouses in the United States that were built in the shape of an [[octagon]], instead of the more traditional rectangular style. Most are located in the northeastern part of the country and some have been restored and placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="Cissell, pg. 293"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cissell|first=Mary Helen|authorlink=|title=More than eight sides to the story: oral histories from students and teachers of Illinois' octagonal Charter Oak School, 1873-1953|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=0557437660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher's residence===
[[File:Tubac, Arizona schoolhouse 2.JPG|thumb|The one-room adobe schoolhouse in [[Tubac, Arizona]], with a teacherage attached to the back.]]
The teacher's residence, or teacherage, was often attached to the school, or very close by, so that a male teacher's wife and family were an integral part of the management and support system for the school. Single, female teachers were more often billeted or boarded with a local family to provide for social norms requiring social supervision of single females.

Motorized [[school bus]]es in the 1920s made longer distances possible, and one-room schools were soon consolidated in most portions of the United States into multiple classroom schools where classes could be held separately for various grade levels. Gradually, one-room school houses were replaced. Most one-room schools had been replaced by larger schools by [[World War II]] except in the most rural areas. However, they are still common in rural parts of Australia and Alaska.

===Preservation: buildings and cultural===
[[File:Agenda school 1.JPG|thumb|Some of the historical one-room schools that survive today remain unrestored, and in disrepair. The one pictured is located on private land in [[Price County, Wisconsin]], and remains unrestored, despite community interest in preserving it.]]

In [[Calvert County, Maryland]], Port Republic School Number 7 closed its doors in 1932 and sat unused for over 40 years. Then, in 1976 the Calvert Retired Teachers Association, looking for a Bicentennial Year project, decided to restore the one-room schoolhouse. On July 24, 1977, after months of hard work by teachers and community volunteers, the old school bell rang out once more, and the little one-room school house, filled with its memories and memorabilia, was ready for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calvert-county.com/school.htm |title=One-Room Schoolhouse |work=Calvert County Living |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now one of the county's tourist attractions. A similar project was done in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]], by retired Teachers and Community Volunteers.  The restored schoolhouse is located in front of [[Queen Anne's County High School]]. In [[Iowa]], over 125 small one-room school houses have been turned into local museums. The buildings in some places found new purpose as homes.   

In [[Harrisburg, Nebraska]], Flowerfield School serves as a living museum, and fourth-graders within the Nebraska panhandle spend a day at Flowerfield going through an average school day in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schools.esu13.org/flowerfield/Default.htm |title=Flowerfield School |publisher=Flowerfield School |year=2005 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students have the opportunity to experience both log and sod versions of the house, writing with quill pens, and a trip to the nearby museum, where they learn about other aspects of life in 1888.

In [[Vandalia, Indiana]], the Vandalia District # 2 one-room schoolhouse served Owen County’s Lafayette Township students in grades 1 – 8 from the time it was completed in 1868 until it closed in 1951. The building, restored by a group of volunteers in 1976, is presently maintained and preserved by the Vandalia Community Preservation Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vandaliacpa.org/index.shtml | title=Vandalia Community Preservation Association | publisher=Organization Founded 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The One Room School House Project of [[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]], includes listings and information on some 880 schools throughout the state and nation. The information, pictures, and stories included in this site have been collected and sent to the project by researchers and historians from across America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17201">'''Oppositional culture''', also known as the ‘’blocked opportunities framework’’ or the “caste theory of education”, is a term most commonly used in studying the [[sociology of education]] to explain [[racial achievement gap in the United States|racial disparities in educational achievement]], particularly between white and black Americans. However, the term refers to any subculture's rejection of conformity to prevailing norms and values, not just nonconformity within the educational system. Thus many criminal [[gang]]s and religious [[cult]]s could also be considered oppositional cultures.

==Background==
This theory relates to a larger generalized topic of [[race and intelligence]]. According to this theory, minority students underachieve intentionally in school and in standardized testing due to a fear of being stereotyped as [[acting white]].&lt;ref name ="Macombe"&gt;Mocombe, Paul, and Carol Tomlin. The Oppositional Culture Theory. Lanham, MD: University of America, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting white refers to activities and attitudes associated with white middle-class Americans. Adherence to white norms in African American communities represents a betrayal of black normative culture. Spurred by the pre-existing theories including the [[culture of poverty]] and the effects of [[urban decay]], oppositional culture emerged in the late 1970s as a theory to explain the education gap.  The principal researcher of this idea, anthropologist John Ogbu, details the principal mechanisms and causes for oppositional culture in his book, “Black Students in an Affluent Suburb, and Minority Status, Oppositional Culture, and Schooling”.

==Historical context==
Racial disparities in education stem from the historical foundations of America, from the époque of slavery into the 20th and 21st centuries. Slave owners in the American South by and large prevented their slaves from becoming literate, fearing that literacy and education would strengthen slave resistance and empower the slaves to revolt against their masters. While African-Americans in the North fared better, black schools struggled to keep their doors open.&lt;ref&gt;The Slave Experience: Education, Arts, and Culture." PBS. PBS, 2004. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/history2.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1896 landmark court case, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' also helped to define education policies in the United States for years to come. The court case ultimately decided that race was an acceptable categorization by which to divide individuals.  Additionally the case determined that separation of these individuals was permissible provided that the condition of both facilities was equal.&lt;ref&gt;"Plessy v. Ferguson." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School, 18 Apr. 1896. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0163_0537_ZO.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case helped to promote segregationist practices that prevented African American children from attending white schools.  African-American schools had fewer resources leading to greater racial gaps in educational achievement.

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided that the concept of separate but equal was unconstitutional in its landmark decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education'' 347 U.S. 483]].  The court also ruled that segregation inherently caused harm to the cognitive development of black children, and officially recognized the importance of educational equality as a compelling interest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Brown v. Board of Education." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School. Web. 02 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZS.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this ruling, Southern school districts began to publish findings of racial gaps in academics as a justification to oppose [[desegregation]].  As a result, the United States adopted compensatory education in order to equalize educational opportunities for all students.&lt;ref name="ogbu"&gt;Ogbu, John U. Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement. Mahwah, NJ: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these efforts, the education gap continues to persist in SAT scores and college acceptance rates.  In the 1980s, a researcher named [[John Ogbu]] suggested that equal opportunity was not enough to diminish the racial disparities gap in education and that additional factors needed to be addressed in order to reduce the racial disparities gap.

==Racial disparities in education today==

Racial disparities continue to persist in the realm of education even today.  A study by George Farkas in 2002 identifies several areas where racial gaps and disparities continue to exist. His research findings show that even in early primary education in pre-school and kindergarten, African American children show lower oral language, pre-reading, and pre-mathematics skills in addition to behavior less suited to school environments.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, George. RACIAL DISPARITIES AND DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION: WHAT DO WE KNOW, HOW DO WE KNOW IT, AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? Department of Sociology and Population Research Institute, 1 July 2002. Web. 16 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In high schools, measures of academic achievement such as grades and class rank also show an under-representation of African American and Hispanics. Additionally, African American and Latino students consistently perform lower on the SAT than their white counterparts thereby affecting their acceptance rates into universities. Even when accounting for differences in socioeconomic status and single parent households this racial disparity, although reduced, continues to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Nichelle. Cultural Disparities of SAT Scores and the Influence on Higher Education Opportunities for African American and Latino Students. Education Resources Information Center. Dominican University of California, 1 Dec. 2007. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED499158.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends have become the basis for sociological theories, including oppositional culture that explain these continuing racial gaps in education achievement.

==Contributions of John Ogbu==
John Ogbu’s primary goal in his research was to explain “academic performance of racial and ethnic minorities with reference to broader societal structures and historical processes &lt;ref name="massey"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. The Source of the River: The Social Origins of Freshmen at America's Selective Colleges and Universities. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;” John Ogbu used case studies, the most famous of which examined the affluent neighborhood of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to research variables that represented oppositional culture. These variables included several explanations of academic disengagement based on African Americans’ self-perception of their work load, their own and white people’s academic efforts, and their own explanations for their disengagement.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt; From this case study and other research, Ogbu formulated his theory of oppositional culture.

===Voluntary vs involuntary minorities===
As part of Ogbu’s analysis, he defines the position of voluntary minorities versus the position of involuntary minorities.  Voluntary minorities in the United States include immigrant minorities such as Chinese and Korean immigrants as well as autonomous minorities such as Mormons and Jews.  Involuntary minorities comprise largely of [[African Americans]], Native Americans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans who were incorporated into American society against their will through colonization, slavery, and conquest.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt; While voluntary minorities view cultural differences as obstacles to be overcome, involuntary minorities view participation in dominant cultural practices as a betrayal of their group loyalty and a threat to their identity.

Ogbu argues that in African American cultures, a collective identity is created from a young age in which cultural frames of reference indicate behaviors that belong culturally and those that do not. According to self-reports of African American students, “[[African American Vernacular English|talking proper]]”, playing sports dominated by white students, and having white friends all show that a person is acting white. Ogbu states that these cultural frames of reference create instances of peer pressure and discourage students from schoolwork.  While black students did not necessarily see getting good grades as acting white, they did disengage from academic work because they perceived certain attitudes and behaviors that were conducive to making good grades as acting white.  These behaviors include the use of [[Standard English]], enrollment in honors and AP classes and acting “smart” in class.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;  Additionally, students in the same sample felt that black individuals gave up some of their cultural background by succeeding in white institutions.

===Policy implications===
Based on his findings, Obgu has proposed certain policy changes to help decrease the gap in racial educational achievement. Ogbu argues that encouraging members of the black community to take proactive roles in increasing academic orientation, effort and performance will greatly affect their children’s academic performance.  Ogbu states that educational efforts are concurrent with cultural practices.  Additionally, he suggests supplementary education programs and increased visibility of successful black role models as helpful solutions.  Obgu also encouraged the development of effective parental educational strategies to combat his findings of little parental involvement in black communities, along with improvements in teacher’s expectations of Black students.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;

==Critical responses to Ogbu’s findings==
Many sociologists and sources have praised his studies as a valuable addition to the theories explaining the gap in educational achievement among different races.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, Dorinda J. "Editor's Review of John U. Ogbu's Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement." Harvard Educational Review. Harvard University, Winter 2004. Web. 18 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/38&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, his research has spurred similar ethno-cultural case studies around the world that have linked gaps in achievement to communities.  One example is a case study done in the UK in 2006 by two researchers, Tomlin and Olusola, that sought to discover factors and conditions that affect the achievement levels of high-achieving black students in two urban secondary schools.  The study found that [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean]] students reported obstacles similar to those faced by African Americans in their attempts to achieve at the levels of their white peers.,&lt;ref name="Macombe"/&gt; Studies that seek to explain overall achievement gaps between blacks and whites have also looked at Ogbu’s criteria from his case studies in education.

However, other sociologists have argued against the validity of his claims.  His findings are most often criticized for overgeneralizing the experience of the black community.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;  A study by Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey found that black students are significantly more likely to believe that education increases the chances of finding a job, and that smart African American students are held in higher esteem by their peers for high academic achievement. These findings all contradict the oppositional culture model proposed by Ogbu.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth-Darnell, James W., and Douglas B. Downey. "Assessing the Oppositional Culture Explanation for Racial/Ethnic Differences in School Performance." American Sociological Review 63.4 (1998): 536-53. Jstor. Web. 16 Mar. 2012. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657266?seq=10&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Cook and Ludwig found that after controlling for socioeconomic status, on average black students were no less alienated from school than white students and were no less popular for being good students.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;  These studies show that inconsistencies regarding the existence of oppositional cultures in black communities persist.

==Alternative explanations==
While oppositional culture offers one explanation for the gap in racial educational achievement, there are alternative explanations for this phenomenon.

==Prudence Carter==
Prudence Carter, a sociologist at Stanford University, published findings that directly contradicted Ogbu’s research that African Americans viewed educational attainment as acting white. She showed in her research, published in her book “Keepin’ it Real: School Success Beyond Black and White”, that the majority of minority students shared 'white' [[norm (social)|normative values]] about the roles of work and success.  Carter argues that the possession of capital and upper [[socioeconomic status]] did not guarantee more interactions with one race over another and that upwardly mobile minorities are more inclined to associate with individuals from their same class over their same racial identification.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Prudence L. Keepin' It Real: School Success beyond Black and White. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter states that a focus on racialized communities is not enough- a holistic acknowledgement of the relevance and depth of students’ general attitudes and beliefs and how these affect schooling will help improve education policies. Studies of these attitudes should rely less on racial lines and focus more on ethno-cultural identities of the individual.

This work is supported by a study by Charles ''et al.'' that surveyed the cultural backgrounds of black students in elite universities in the United States.  The study found that even though immigrants of African heritage from Africa and the Caribbean represent less than ten percent of the total black population in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NISF), half of them went to l0 of the most selective NISF schools. More than one third of [[multiracial]] black and other race individuals, who are only 11 percent of the population, also attend the top 10 NISF schools. Multiracial individuals and African immigrants typically are advantaged in socioeconomic status and pre-college preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Charles A. "Black like Who?" Racism in Post-race America: New Theories, New Directions. Chapel Hill, NC: Social Forces, University of North Carolina, 2008. 247-63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This work shows that race may not be the primary determinant of racial educational achievement and that other factors including socioeconomic status play larger roles in determining educational outcome.

==Stereotype Threat Assumption==
[[Stereotype threat|Stereotype Threat Assumption]] is another explanation for the racial gap in educational achievement.  According to this theory, African Americans endure stereotypes of intellectual inferiority. Fearing that they would meet these expectations of underperformance, they make the decision to disengage from academics. Additionally, studies have shown that stereotypes themselves divert mental resources away from the area of concentration and can worsen classroom performance, comfort interacting with teachers, and other areas of scholastic life.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Claude. Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings of anxiety combined with the stigmatization acts as an inherent obstacle for African American educational achievement. Some African Americans choose to disengage from academics altogether to avoid meeting the expectations of failure and underachievement. This disengagement in academics demonstrates a perceived devaluation in African American culture.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

==Capital deficiency==
The capital deficiency theory is heavily related to [[Racial inequality in the United States]], specifically the racial wealth gap. Wealthier families with higher [[economic capital]] can afford to provide additional resources for their children to combat any learning difficulties they may face naturally.  A related form of capital, [[human capital]], or the skills, abilities, and knowledge possessed by an individual are passed down in families with higher accumulation of human capital.  Parents with higher human capital are also better prepared to supervise their children's acquisition of it. [[Social capital]] and [[cultural capital]] also provide the means for increased support in educational outcomes. Social and cultural capital help to expose children into beneficial social institutions through bonds of kinship and friendship with the skills to navigate these social spheres fluidly.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

There are hundreds and thousands of [[Pakistan]]i students who travel abroad each year in order to attain higher education. Countries which have large Pakistani international student populations include those in [[Europe]], North America, China and Australia. Every year, nearly 10,000 foreign student visas are granted in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="spike"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
According to various reports, there are nearly 10,000 Pakistani students studying in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pallyweb.com/talented-students-to-be-welcomed-in-uk-envoy|title=Car services in talented-students-to-be-welcomed-in-uk-envoy|first=Ivan|last=Bleart|website=pallyweb.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iptu.co.uk/content/pakistan_economy.asp|title=Pakistan Trade, Pakistan Industries, India Pakistan Trade Unit|first=Websynergi|last=Design|website=www.iptu.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, between 2004 and 2008, as many as 42,000 Pakistani students were admitted into the UK.&lt;ref name="spike"&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/printable/6543/ Don’t close the door to Asian students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203123823/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/printable/6543/ |date=2012-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an [[Oxford University Pakistan Society]] at the University of Oxford as well as Strathclyde University Pakistan Society at University of Strathclyde Glasgow.

==United States==
As of 2011, there were 5,045 Pakistani students in the [[United States]], putting Pakistan among the top 25 countries sending students to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdwali.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/u-s-embassy-islamabad-celebrates-international-education-week/|title=U.S. Embassy Islamabad Celebrates International Education Week|date=20 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume of Pakistani students migrating to the United States has been relatively stable over the past few years. ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' reports that the drop in the number of Pakistani students in the United States following the September 11 attacks is a myth and observes that the numbers going to the US for study have simply decreased due to an increase in more higher education institutions opening back home. According to Shazia Khan, "In the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the number of higher education institutes in Pakistan. This encourages many students to study in the country and not apply abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/363168/higher-education-visa-denials-a-myth-for-drop-in-pakistani-students-in-us/|title=Higher education: Visa denials a myth for drop in Pakistani students in US   - The Express Tribune|date=12 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portugal==
There are many Pakistani students enrolled in different Portuguese universities. Most of the students are doing their doctoral degrees. The medium of instruction for master's degree (5 years) is Portuguese but doctoral level research is in English. Most of the students have scholarship from the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fct.pt/|title=FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia|website=www.fct.pt|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the programs are specifically designed for foreign students like the programs offered by the MAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.edu.pt/|title=MAP         —         MAP|website=www.map.edu.pt|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consortium.

==China==
[[China]] also attracts a large number of students from Pakistan, with 2006 estimates putting their number well over 1,000; in [[Xinjian]] alone, there are over 500 Pakistanis in universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73161&amp;Itemid=2|title=Xinjiang has special place in Pak, China friendship: Ambassador Khan|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210841/http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73161&amp;Itemid=2|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are over 5,000 Pakistani medical students studying in China as of September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012%5C09%5C10%5Cstory_10-9-2012_pg7_27|title=Daily Times|website=Daily Times|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, there were 19,000 Pakistani students in China, making Pakistan the fourth largest source of international students in the country. The main disciplines of studies pursued included medicine, engineering, economics and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1317973/|title=19,000 Pakistani students studying in Chinese universities|work=Dawn|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, these students are enrolled in three leading Medical Universities of Cuba named Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Villa Clara, Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Sancti Spiritus and Universidad de Ciencias Médicas Cienfuegos.
In February 2014 the first batch of 295 students graduated from the University of Villa Clara. The ceremony was held in the presence of ambassador of Pakistan in Cuba and vice minister of Cuba for health.

== Germany ==
Nowadays Germany is also a choice of many Pakistani Students to study. The only barrier that students face is the language. Although some study programs are in English but they have to learn [[German Language]] for their daily life. There are both undergraduate and graduate programs available. But those who are undergraduate have to do one-year program [[Studienkolleg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19003">'''Pay-for-Performance (Federal Government)''' is a method of employee motivation meant to improve performance in the [[United States]] [[federal government]] by offering incentives such as salary increases, bonuses, and benefits.  It is a similar concept to [[Merit pay|Merit Pay]] for public teachers and it follows basic models from [[Performance-related pay|Performance-related Pay]] in the private sector.  According to recent studies, however, there are key differences in how pay-for-performance models influence federal employees in public service roles.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Annie Hondeghem, and Lois Recascino Wise. “Revisiting the Motivational Based of Public Service: Twenty Years of Research and an Agenda for the Future.” Public Administration Review, 2010: pg. 681-690&lt;/ref&gt; [[James L. Perry|James Perry]] is one scholar who has conducted such studies.  His research reveals that public servants tend to be more intrinsically motivated, and thus, are prone to have a negative reaction to monetary incentives.  There is still debate, however, on what exactly makes the public sector different.

==History==

Pay-for-performance programs first began in the private sector. As consultants, academic experts, and employee advocate groups analyzed merit pay systems' success in private businesses, they recommended expanding this method into the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.13&lt;/ref&gt;   One vital omission in the process of implementation, however, is that the policy makers failed to consider that the stakeholders in the private sector differ from those in the public sector.

The first trial run of a pay-for-performance system came in the late 1970s.  In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter introduced the broad outlines of the [[Civil Service Reform Act]] in his [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/poldocs/uspressu/SUaddressJCarter.pdf State of the Union] message.  It was the first time a U.S. President had ever included civil service reform among his major legislative proposals.

The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created the Office of Personnel Management, to oversee the human resource management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, merit pay on a variety of levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt; This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others would of necessity be receive less than in the previous system.

The greatest benefits of the Act were that it clarified job expectations and defined goals and objectives. The clearest shortcoming was that it failed to establish a “demonstrable relationship between pay and performance.” &lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.27&lt;/ref&gt; This failure had a number of causes—most notably a lack of adequate funding. Managers who performed satisfactorily often found themselves receiving less pay than their non-managerial counterparts because the non-managerial employees were still under the previous pay system. Some complained that this merit system seemed arbitrary and many employees did not perceive it as a fair assessment of performance and effort.  Furthermore, the public became upset when they saw certain senior executives in the government receiving large paychecks. It became apparent that the Act was not an effective means of civic service reform.
[[File:Ronald Reagan - NARA - 558523.jpg|thumb|President Ronald Reagan]]
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1982, he significantly reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying the need for new legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that at least half of the board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 28-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was considered a significant improvement over its predecessor, PMRS only lasted from 1984 to 1991. The demise of PMRS was caused by poor discrimination among performance levels, inadequate performance findings, and little demonstrable evidence that the system improved performance.  Over 50 percent of the employees felt like the size of the rewards was inadequate, and more than 75 percent of the managers stated that their performance evaluations provided little guidance for development purposes, mentioning that “insufficient funds [had] resulted in meaningless performance awards.”&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the PMRS was abandoned, various proposals have surfaced and even a few agencies have tried variations of pay-for-performance systems.  The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STEPHEN LOSEY |url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20100806/BENEFITS01/8060302/1001 |title=DoD ends pay-for-performance system for most intel workers |publisher=FederalTimes.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Department of Homeland Security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0607.shtm |title=DHS: Fact Sheet: DHS and OPM Final Human Resource Regulations |publisher=Dhs.gov |date=2002-11-25 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; have both developed systems, but they were annulled when President Barack Obama signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010|National Defense Authorization Act]] on October 28, 2009.  There has yet to be a new pay-for-performance system implemented on a nationwide scale for the United States Federal Government.

==Research==

When these federal pay for performance systems failed, many were surprised because it had worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed to the fact that most of the research on pay for performance had been done in the private rather than public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance-Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg.47&lt;/ref&gt; These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.

===Unique Characteristics of the Public Sector===
A limited and restricted budget is one of the biggest factors that have prevented the public sector from successfully implementing a pay for performance program.  As noted by Antoinette Weibel, the private sector simply has more money and will always be more fluid with cash than any public sector organization.  [[Profit motive]] will always matter in the private sector because a business organization's function is to maximize profits.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since public organizations operate on tax revenue, they are expected to act responsibly for that stewardship of resources. Public institutions also operate in nonmarket conditions and are subject to unique rules and expectations.  This makes budgeting for incentives very difficult because unlike private sector businesses, public organizations cannot arrange their incentives around the company profit.  By their very nature of receiving funds instead of generating them, public organizations can never have the same freedom that private organizations have in providing incentives in the work force.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance-Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

As important as the budget differences are to the issue of pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, [[Edward L. Deci]] and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals.  Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an "interesting" activity to perform.  Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards.  Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.&lt;ref&gt;Deci, Edward L. “Effects of Externally Mediated Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 18:1, 1971: pg. 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenberger designed a study meant to refute Deci's claim.  His results reported that “perceived competence partially mediated the positive relationship found between performance-contingent reward and intrinsic motivation.”&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, Robert W.; Pierce, David; and Cameron J., Judy:  Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation, 1999: pg 678&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the detrimental effects of providing tangible rewards, discussed in the Deci studies, occurred under highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions.

Although a push for providing extrinsic motivation is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward the understanding of Deci and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector.  Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations are more likely to be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically.  They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment.  Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 387-412&lt;/ref&gt;

Weibel contributed further to Perry and Deci's findings when she and her team examined the benefits and costs of an extrinsically motivated system, and compared this system in the public and the private sectors.  This clearly defined scope allowed the pay-for-performance policies in each sector to be evaluated individually.  The authors’ hypothesis was that the public sector has specific characteristics (the same as those diagnosed by Deci and Perry) that would make pay for performance ineffective, calling the proposed adoption for such policies “naïve.” &lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Developments===

Research has continued to support the notion that although incentive systems may be effective and efficient in one organizational context, they can be ineffective or even counterproductive in others.  [[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]] has been another persuasive voice who has drawn on many of these studies to call for new methods of motivation in the workplace. [[Image:Daniel H pink.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Daniel H. Pink in London]] He cites an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] study in which the research team repeatedly demonstrated that as long as the tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical, performance-related pay works to improve results.  The moment a task required any cognitive skill, the incentives became detrimental to performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dan Ariely |author2=Uri Gneezy |author3=George Loewenstein |author4=Nina Mazar  |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf |title=Large Stakes and Big Mistakes, Working Paper |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Working Papers pg: 05-11|date=2005-07-23 |accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Weibel, have also urged caution in implementing the pay-for-performance models of old.  In the federal government, this is especially important because intrinsically motivated public service agents are shown to have a “higher incentive to invest in expert knowledge than extrinsically motivated ones and therefore function as the ‘[[institutional memory]]’ of public service.”&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve that institutional memory and continue to attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay.  Some have suggested an incentive plan that focuses on employees' internal motivation.  Instead of cash bonuses or raises, employees may instead be given discretionary time to work on creative projects in which they have a personal interest, as has been implemented by companies such as [http://gigaom.com/collaboration/mix-up-the-workweek-by-setting-your-own-20-percent-time/ Google and 3M].  Another alternative to a strictly intrinsically based model may be a hybrid in which monetary rewards and intrinsic incentives are offered, giving the employees of both dispositions the motivation to increase performance.  It is unclear what the next step of action will be for the federal government, but since the issue of pay for performance is so politically popular it is unlikely that the issue will go away any time soon.

The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and Office of Budget and Management asked federal government agencies to maximize performance as well as reevaluate and restructure human capital. These agencies were also required to amend ineffective policies on performance management. The PMA recommended streamlining the system of compensating and rewarding federal employees. One way is move from the present General Schedule approach to a system that emphasizes performance-based wages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fedweek.com/issue-briefs/pay-for-performance-possible-but-takes-much-work-says-mspb/|title=Pay for Performance Possible but Takes Much Work, Says MSPB|date=2018-06-06|work=FEDweek|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the USA and many countries of Western Europe, pay for performance plans are used collectively. In Hong Kong, the popularity of pay for performance is increasing gradually both in the public and private sectors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1916506/science-shows-pay-performance-works-if-used-properly|title=Science shows pay for performance works, if used properly|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Pennsylvania Department of Education''' is the [[Executive branch|executive department]] of the state charged with publicly funded preschool, [[K-12]] and [[adult education]]al budgeting, management and guidelines. As the [[state education agency]], its activities are directed by the governor appointed [[Pennsylvania]]'s Secretary of Education. The agency is headquartered at 333 Market Street in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_information/7203 Department Information]", ''Pennsylvania Department of Education''. Retrieved on April 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees 500 public school districts [[List of school districts in Pennsylvania|public school districts of Pennsylvania]], over 170ublic charter schools (2014), 14 public cyber charter schools, Career and Technology Centers/Vocational Technical schools, 29 public [[Intermediate Unit]]s, the education of youth in State Juvenile Correctional Institutions, Head Starts and publicly funded preschools in the Commonwealth (PreK Counts Keystone Stars) and 22 community colleges. In 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Education employs approximately 600 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Education, Employment Opportunities, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency maintains a database of all education institutions in the Commonwealth with associated data. EdNA [http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/find_an_institution/7205/education_names_and_addresses__(edna_v_2)/509789] These entities include school districts and their schools, intermediate units, area vocational technical schools, charter schools, nonpublic and private schools, higher education institutions and more.

== History ==
Following passage and signing of the Free School Law on April 1, 1834, the Secretary of the Commonwealth acted as head of the Common School System until 1837.  In that year a separate Department of Schools was created with a Superintendent of Common Schools as its chief officer. In 1873, the title was changed to Superintendent of Public Instruction, and greater responsibilities were assigned to that official and to the Department. In 1969, the name of the Department of Public Instruction was changed to the Department of Education, with the title of Superintendent of Public Instruction changed to the Secretary of Education.  It previously ran the [[Pennsylvania State Board of Censors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/about_pde/7203 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=About PDE |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Secretary of Education ==
* [[Pedro Rivera (educator)|Pedro Rivera]], Confirmed June, 2015

== Purpose ==
The mission statement of the Pennsylvania Department of Education is "to assist the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Governor]], the Secretary of Education and Pennsylvania educators in providing for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of education."  The Department has broad discretionary powers in both the development and administration of educational policies which enhance the educational experience and quality in Pennsylvania.  The Department also works as an ongoing study of the educational process within the state, conducting studies and programs designed to evaluate specific needs or qualities of the system.  In doing so, the Pennsylvania Department of Education will recommend changes and improvements to the Governor, the Board of Education, and the General Assembly.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education also oversees policies of public libraries, academic libraries, and the [[State Library of Pennsylvania]] located in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].  It provides policy of equal opportunity in the educational system, with special regard to nonpublic education and state policy of education.  It is within the Pennsylvania Department of Education's mission to collaborate with other state educational departments in an effort to create a cohesive and dynamic learning environment.

==Offices and sub groups==
The Pennsylvania Department of Education operates a plethora of offices and participates in many state related agencies/Boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pde.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/departmental_offices/7235 |title=Pennsylvania Department of Education Departmental Offices |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project 985''' ({{zh|c=985工程|p= Jiǔbāwǔ gōngchéng}}) is a project that was first announced by CPC General secretary and Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]] at the 100th anniversary of Peking University on May 4, 1998, to promote the development and reputation of the [[Higher education in China|Chinese higher education system]] by founding world-class universities in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/edinburgh-global/partnerships/region/focus-china/resources-information/universities-china/project-985 Project 985,The University of Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the date of the announcement, May 1998, or 98/5 according to the Chinese [[calendar date#Date format|date format]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cedu/ceduproject211.php |title=Project 211 and 985 |work=China Education Center Ltd. |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project involves both national and local governments allocating large amounts of funding to certain universities&lt;ref name="projectInfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/59436.htm |title=985工程 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to build new research centers, improve facilities, hold international conferences, attract world-renowned faculty and visiting scholars, and help Chinese faculty attend conferences abroad.&lt;ref name="fundingUse"/&gt;

In 2009, the original 9 founding member universities of Project 985 formed the [[C9 League]],&lt;ref name="fundingUse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/ewenr/06oct/practical.htm |title=International Rankings and Chinese Higher Education Reform |work=World Education News and Reviews |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is referred to as the Chinese equivalent of the US [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref name="C9League"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xjtunews.xjtu.edu.cn/zhxw/2009-10/1255091987d24517.shtml |title=9所首批"985工程"建设高校签订《一流大学人才培养合作与交流协议书》 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015052830/http://xjtunews.xjtu.edu.cn/zhxw/2009-10/1255091987d24517.shtml |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the second phase of the project, 39 universities were sponsored.

In September 2017, a related plan called the [[Double First Class University Plan]] was announced.&lt;ref name="people.cn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0921/c90000-9272101.html |title=China to develop 42 world-class universities | work=People's Daily |date= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-09/25/content_32446664.htm |title=双一流大学 (shuāngyīliú dàxué): Double top university plan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925043627/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-09/25/content_32446664.htm |archivedate=2017-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear whether this plan represents a new way of ranking universities in China,&lt;ref name="people.cn"/&gt; or replaces [[Project 211]] and Project 985.&lt;ref name="China Daily"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6472">'''Project Re-ED''', the Project on the Re-Education of Emotionally Disturbed Children, is a program to provide effective and affordable mental health services for children. The program focuses on teaching a child effective ways of acting in and responding to the child’s social groups (family, schools, peer groups) and also working with those social groups to help them provide a more supportive environment for the child. It began as a pilot project in the 1960s at two residential facilities in Tennessee and North Carolina. It later expanded to more facilities, and the principles of treatment developed in the project have been replicated and adapted in many other programs. 

== History ==
The program was initiated by an 8-year grant awarded in 1961 by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to the [[Peabody College|George Peabody College for Teachers]] (then a separate school, now part of [[Vanderbilt University]]) along with the states of Tennessee and North Carolina. [[Nicholas Hobbs]], a psychology professor and chair the Division of Human Development at Peabody College, was the project’s primary developer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warren, S. (2007). Project Re-ED. In C. Reynolds et al.(Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of special education: A reference for the education of children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities and other exceptional individuals''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. Retrieved from http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyse/project_re_ed/0&lt;/ref&gt; The two states each provided a small residential school – Cumberland House in Nashville, TN and Wright School in Durham, NC –  and at the end of the grant period the states assumed responsibility for continuing and funding the program.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lewis, W. W. (1971). Project Re-ED: The program and a preliminary evaluation. In H. C. Rickard (Ed.), ''Behavioral intervention in human problems''. Elmsford, NY: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of decades, more than two dozen re-ed schools had been established, and many more facilities had applied principles developed in the re-ed program.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Habel, J. (1998). Precipitating myself into just manageable difficulties: Constructing an intellectual biography of Nicholas Hobbs. In DeMarrias, K. (Ed.), ''Inside stories: Qualitative research reflections''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was a response to a 1954 study from the [[Southern Regional Education Board]] and the National Institute of Mental Health which noted the lack of adequate services and facilities for emotionally disturbed children available at the time in the southeast United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The structure of the Re-ED program was inspired in large part by residential programs in post-World War II Scotland and France addressing mental health needs in children resulting from effects of the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These programs were staffed largely by teachers who received primarily on-the-job practical training in psychological therapy. Following that model, Project Re-ED carefully selected effective, experienced teachers with demonstrated adaptability and creativity, and provided them with one year of graduate level practical and theoretical training in working with emotionally disturbed children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Philosophy == 
Development of the program was guided by [[social learning theory]] and ecological theory, and the program takes an educational rather than a therapeutic approach.

Following social learning theory, the program considers it important to focus on assisting children to learn new and more positive ways to interact with others in a social setting. 

Following ecological theory, the program emphasizes a holistic approach of addressing issues in the family, school, peer group, and other social settings of a child’s life together at the same time. This way, counsellors can see how troubling issues in each of these social settings influence each other, rather than addressing each setting in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Duchnowski, A. J. Kutash, K. &amp; Friedman, R. M. (2002). Community-based interventions in a system of care and outcomes framework. In B. J. Burns, &amp; K. Hoagwood (Eds). ''Community treatment for youth: Evidence-based interventions for severe emotional and behavioral disorders''. New York: Oxford University Press, pp.16-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of the re-education method is to view emotionally disturbed children’s problems as symptoms resulting from problems in the child’s social settings. So, rather than seeing the goal as curing a child’s mental illness in long-term private, individual therapy, the program seeks to restructure a child’s environment and teach the child how to act more constructively and positively within that environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

== Evaluation ==
Follow-up studies indicate that the program does effectively attain its goal of restoring and improving social operation of children and their environment in a relatively short amount of time  (with an average stay in the program of about 7 months) relative to similar children not in the program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study of the results in children ages 6-12 found a substantial reduction in problem behaviors among former students in the program, with greater gains associated with younger age and a longer stay in the program.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, E., Farmer, E. M. Z., Apperson, J., Mustillo, S., &amp; Simmers, D. (2006). Treatment and posttreatment effects of residential treatment using a re-education model. ''Behavioral Disorders'', 31(3), 312-322.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found positive results among adolescents in the program, including among students who had not done well in other programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, S. R., Murphy, J., Devaney, A., &amp; Hultman, T. (2000). Ecological outcomes of adolescents in a psychoeducational residential treatment facility. ''American Journal of Orthopsychiatry'', 70(4), 491-500. doi:10.1037/h0087807 &lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies noted, however, the difficulty of determining what specific aspects of such a program influence which positive results. In general, the program is judged a viable and effective means of providing help to emotionally disturbed children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Robert Foster Cherry Award''' is a prize given biennially by [[Baylor University]] for "great teaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baylor Cherry Award |url=https://www.baylor.edu/cherry_awards/ |author=Baylor University|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Foster Cherry Award |url=https://www.fundsforngos.org/awards-and-prizes/robert-foster-cherry-award-winner-receive-prize-250000/ |author=Funds for NGOs|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherry Award honors professors at the College or University level, in the English-speaking world, with established track records of teaching excellence and the ability to inspire students. Robert Foster Cherry, a graduate of [[Baylor University]] (A.B., 1929), made an estate bequest to establish the award. In a typical award cycle, three Finalists are selected based on nomination packages. The Finalists then compete for the award by giving a series of lectures at Baylor University.

'''Saxon math''', developed by [[John Saxon (educator)|John Saxon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinamericaneducation.com/common-core-state-standards/recognizing-an-american-hero-john-saxon/|title=Recognizing an American Hero: John Saxon {{!}} Truth in American Education|date=2014-07-24|work=Truth in American Education|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a teaching method for incremental learning of mathematics. It involves teaching a new mathematical concept every day and constantly reviewing old concepts.  Early editions were deprecated for providing very few opportunities to practice the new material before plunging into a review of all previous material.  Newer editions typically split the day's work evenly between practicing the new material and reviewing old material.  Its primary strength is in a steady review of all previous material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/15/how-a-war-hero-launched-a-war-on-bad-math-instruction/|title=How A War Hero Launched A War On Bad Math Instruction|last=Hayes|first=Nakonia|date=15 August 2016|website=thefederalist.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is especially important to students who struggle with retaining the math they previously learned.

The Saxon Math 1 to Algebra 1/2 (the equivalent of a Pre-Algebra book) curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianbook.com/page/homeschool/math/saxon-math/saxon-algebra-12|title=Saxon Algebra 1/2 Math Curriculum - Christianbook.com|website=www.christianbook.com|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed so that students complete assorted mental math problems, learn a new mathematical concept, practice problems relating to that lesson, and solve a variety of problems. Daily practice problems include relevant questions from the current day's lesson as well as cumulative problems. This daily cycle is interrupted for tests and additional topics. From Algebra 1/2 on, the higher level books remove the mental math problems and incorporate testing more frequently.

The Saxon math program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homeschoolmath.net/curriculum_reviews/saxon.php|title=Reviews of Saxon math curriculum from HomeschoolMath.net|website=www.homeschoolmath.net|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a specific set of products to support [[homeschool]]ers, including solution keys and ready-made tests, which makes it popular among some homeschool families.  It has also been adopted as an alternative to [[reform mathematics]] programs in public and private schools.  Saxon teaches memorization of algorithms, unlike many reform texts.

== Replacing standards-based texts ==
By the mid-2000s, many school districts were considering abandoning experiments with reform approaches which had not produced acceptable test scores.  For example, school board member Debbie Winskill in [[Tacoma, Washington]] said that the non-traditional [[Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP)]] "has been a dismal failure." Speaking to the board, [[Mount Tahoma High School]] teacher Clifford Harris noted that he taught sophomores in another district Saxon Math, and their [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning]] scores have continually climbed. Unlike IMP, Saxon program gives students plenty of chances to review material, so they retain their skills, he said.&lt;ref name=Abe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6051712p-5310251c.html |title=Back to basics on kids’ math: Alarmed by low scores, Tacoma school officials OK added Saxon textbook |last=Abe |first=Debby |newspaper=The News Tribune |location=Tacoma, WA |date=August 25, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025081451/http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6051712p-5310251c.html |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2006, Tacoma Public Schools introduced the Saxon books district-wide and rejected the previous IMP textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003674945_sundaymath22.html New-age math doesn't add up]. Bruce Ramsey; ''Seattle Times'' (Seattle WA) April 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonics and spelling ==
Saxon Publishers has also published phonics and spelling curriculum. This curriculum, authored by Lorna Simmons and first published in 2005, follows the same incremental principles as the Saxon Math curriculum.&lt;ref name="Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2"&gt;[http://cathyduffyreviews.com/phonics_reading/saxon-phonics-k.htm Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2]. Cathy Duffy; "Cathy Duffy Reviews" Reviewed 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curriculum published provides four different levels of materials. The first three levels, starting in Kindergarten and progressing through second grade, offers daily lessons consisting of three main parts: lesson warm-up, new increment, and application and continual review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcrr.org/FCRRReports/PDF/SaxonPhonicsSpelling.pdf Florida Center for Reading Research: Saxon Phonics and Spelling K-3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005305/http://www.fcrr.org/FCRRReports/PDF/SaxonPhonicsSpelling.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }}. Mary VanSciver, M.S.; FCRR (Tallahassee, FL) April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An assessment tool is included with the teaching materials to show teachers where students may be struggling, and it also provides remediation methods to reiterate the failing concepts. The fourth level of curriculum is intended for the third grade and allows for further advancement in spelling skills.&lt;ref name="Saxon Phonics K, 1, &amp; 2"/&gt; Each level consists of various teaching materials to support the daily lesson plans and remediation factors known of Saxon curriculum. Specifically, the Saxon Phonics and Spelling curricula is "beneficial for struggling readers because of the structure and repetitive characteristics associated with Saxon Publisher's curriculum." &lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hargett; Homeschool mother for the past 24 years (Fredericksburg, VA) November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that students using the Saxon Phonics and Spelling program showed improvement over a school year in phonics, reading, and spelling.&lt;ref name="rigby.hmhco.com"&gt;[http://rigby.hmhco.com/HA/correlations/pdf/s/SaxonPhonicsEvalFinalReport11_6_07.pdf Saxon Phonics and Spelling Randomized Control Trial]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005305/http://rigby.hmhco.com/HA/correlations/pdf/s/SaxonPhonicsEvalFinalReport11_6_07.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }} Miriam Resendez, M.A. &amp; Mariam Azin, Ph.D.; '''Planning, Research &amp; Evaluation Services Associates, Inc.''' (Jackson, WY) October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that this program works just as well with males as with females and with special education and non-special education students.&lt;ref name="rigby.hmhco.com"/&gt;

Saxon curriculum remains popular among homeschooling families but is also starting to be incorporated into public schools as well. The repetitive curriculum design provides students with constant reinforcements of previously learned concepts. This routine practice reinforces important topics into the student long-term memory. School districts find this especially beneficial when they need to raise their testing scores in math, phonics, and spelling.

== In popular culture ==

Saxon math textbooks are visible on a table in the film [[Last Action Hero]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">A '''Small Learning Community''' ('''SLC'''), also referred to as a '''School-Within-A-School''', is a [[school organizational models|school organizational model]] that is an increasingly common form of [[learning environment]] in [[United States|American]] [[secondary school]]s to subdivide large school populations into smaller, autonomous groups of students and teachers.  SLCs can also be physical [[learning space]]s.

The primary purpose of restructuring secondary schools into SLCs is to create a more [[personalized learning]] environment to better meet the needs of students.&lt;ref name="AFA"&gt;''Architecture for Achievement - building patterns of small school learning'', Victoria Bergsagel, Tim Best, Kathleen Cushman, Lorne McConachie, Wendy Sauer, David Stephen.  Mercer Island, WA.  1997.  Page 101-104.  {{ISBN|978-0-9796777-0-0}}.  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt; Each community will often share the same teachers and student members from grade to grade. Teachers in these units usually have common planning time to allow them to develop interdisciplinary projects and keep up with the progress of their shared students.

==Types==
SLCs can take several forms.

* Theme-Based Smaller Learning Communities or Focus Schools are usually formed around a specific curricular theme.  Examples might include "Success Academy" or "Humanities".
* Houses may be themed or non-themed or separated by grade levels.
* Career Academies are generally a three- or four-year structure developed around a career theme or [[Career Clusters]].  Characterized by career-related electives and integration of career theme across entire academic curriculum.
* Freshman Academies are structure designed to support 9th grade students as they transition into high school.
* Magnet Schools are a career-themed SLC that includes accelerated course-work for Gifted &amp; Talented students.

== Courses ==
Core courses include:

* SLC Portfolio

* SLC Honors World History I: Prehistory - 1500
* SLC Honors World History II: 1500 - Present
* SLC Honors United States History (or SLC Honors European History)

* SLC Honors Geometry
* SLC Honors Algebra II
* SLC Honors Statistics
* SLC Honors Biology: Ecological &amp; Molecular (E/M)
* SLC Honors Chemistry
* SLC Honors Environmental Science: Practical &amp; Experimental (P/E)
* SLC Heart of Advanced Science (In some schools, this course is called "SLC Integrated Advanced Sciences")
* SLC Honors English I
* SLC Honors English II
* SLC Completion of Advanced English (In some schools, this course is called "SLC Honors English III")

Electives include:

* SLC Language Enrichment (French, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, Russian or German; depending on school)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26928">{{Socrates}}
{{Platonism}}
The '''Socratic method''', also known as '''maieutics''', '''method of elenchus''', '''elenctic method''', or '''Socratic debate''', is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate [[critical thinking]] and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It is a [[dialectic]]al method, involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point. This method is named after the [[Classical Greek philosophy|Classical Greek]] philosopher [[Socrates]] and is introduced by him in [[Plato]]'s [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] as midwifery ([[wikt:maieutic|maieutics]]) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding.

The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs. The basic form is a series of [[question]]s formulated as tests of [[logic]] and fact intended to help a person or group discover their [[beliefs]] about some topic, exploring definitions or ''[[logoi]]'' (singular ''[[logos]]'') and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances.

==Development==
In the second half of the 5th century BC, [[sophists]] were teachers who specialized in using the tools of [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]] to entertain, impress, or persuade an audience to accept the speaker's point of view. Socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching which came to be called the Socratic method.

Socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow [[Athens|Athenians]] after his friend from youth, [[Chaerephon]], visited the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], which confirmed that no man in [[Greece]] was wiser than Socrates. Socrates saw this as a [[paradox]], and began using the Socratic method to answer his conundrum. [[Diogenes Laërtius]], however, wrote that [[Protagoras]] invented the “Socratic” method.&lt;ref&gt;Jarratt, Susan C. ''Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991., p 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Rosamond Kent, ''The Older Sophists'', Hackett Publishing Company ({{ISBN|0-87220-556-8}}), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] famously formalized the Socratic elenctic style in prose—presenting Socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent Athenian interlocutor—in some of his early [[dialogue]]s, such as ''[[Euthyphro]]'' and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', and the method is most commonly found within the so-called "[[Socratic dialogue]]s", which generally portray Socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues. But in his later dialogues, such as [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] or [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], Plato had a different method to philosophical discussions, namely [[dialectic]].

==Method==
'''Elenchus''' ({{lang-grc|ἔλεγχος|elengkhos|argument of disproof or refutation; cross-examining, testing, scrutiny esp. for purposes of refutation}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott and Jones, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', 9th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the central technique of the Socratic method. The Latin form ''elenchus'' (plural ''elenchi'') is used in English as the technical philosophical term.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'', 4th Edition; ''Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common adjectival form in English is ''elenctic''; ''elenchic'' and ''elenchtic'' are also current.

In Plato's early dialogues, the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate, for example, the nature or definition of ethical concepts such as justice or virtue. According to Vlastos,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, 'The Socratic Elenchus', ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy I'', Oxford 1983, 27–58.&lt;/ref&gt; it has the following steps:

# Socrates' [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] asserts a thesis, for example "Courage is endurance of the soul", which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation.
# Socrates secures his interlocutor's agreement to further premises, for example "Courage is a fine thing" and "Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing".
# Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that these further premises imply the contrary of the original thesis; in this case, it leads to: "courage is not endurance of the soul".
# Socrates then claims that he has shown that his interlocutor's thesis is false and that its negation is true.

One elenctic examination can lead to a new, more refined, examination of the concept being considered, in this case it invites an examination of the claim: "Courage is ''wise'' endurance of the soul". Most Socratic inquiries consist of a series of elenchi and typically end in puzzlement known as ''[[aporia]]''.

Frede&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frede, "Plato's Arguments and the Dialogue Form", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 1992, Oxford 1992, 201–19.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that Vlastos' conclusion in step #4 above makes nonsense of the [[aporetic]] nature of the early dialogues. Having shown that a proposed thesis is false is insufficient to conclude that some other competing thesis must be true. Rather, the interlocutors have reached [[aporia]], an improved state of still not knowing what to say about the subject under discussion.

The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate, in particular concerning whether it is a positive method, leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Salkever, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1992/03.05.09.html "Methods of Interpreting Plato and his Dialogues"] ([[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. K. C. Guthrie]] in ''The Greek Philosophers'' sees it as an error to regard the Socratic method as a means by which one seeks the answer to a problem, or knowledge. Guthrie claims that the Socratic method actually aims to demonstrate one's ignorance. Socrates, unlike the [[Sophists]], did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's ignorance. Guthrie writes, "[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not."{pg 74}

==Application==

Socrates generally applied his method of examination to concepts that seem to lack any concrete definition; e.g., the key moral concepts at the time, the [[virtue]]s of [[piety]], [[wisdom]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[courage]], and [[justice]]. Such an examination challenged the implicit moral beliefs of the interlocutors, bringing out inadequacies and inconsistencies in their beliefs, and usually resulting in [[aporia]]. In view of such inadequacies, Socrates himself professed his ignorance, but others still claimed to have knowledge. Socrates believed that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge. While this belief seems paradoxical at first glance, it in fact allowed Socrates to discover his own errors where others might assume they were correct. This claim was known by the anecdote of the Delphic oracular pronouncement that Socrates was the wisest of all men. (Or, rather, that no man was wiser than Socrates.)

Socrates used this claim of wisdom as the basis of his moral exhortation. Accordingly, he claimed that the chief goodness consists in the caring of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding, that "wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state", and that "life without examination [dialogue] is not worth living". It is with this in mind that the Socratic method is employed.

The motive for the modern usage of this method and Socrates' use are not necessarily equivalent. Socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories, instead using [[mythology|myth]] to explain them. The [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides dialogue]] shows [[Parmenides]] using the Socratic method to point out the flaws in the Platonic [[Theory of Forms|theory of the Forms]], as presented by Socrates; it is not the only dialogue in which theories normally expounded by Plato/Socrates are broken down through dialectic. Instead of arriving at answers, the method was used to break down the theories we hold, to go "beyond" the axioms and postulates we take for granted. Therefore, myth and the Socratic method are not meant by Plato to be incompatible; they have different purposes, and are often described as the "left hand" and "right hand" paths to good and wisdom.

===Socratic Circles===

A '''Socratic Circle''' (also known as a '''Socratic Seminar''') is a pedagogical approach based on the Socratic method and uses a [[dialogic]] approach to understand information in a text. Its systematic procedure is used to examine a text through questions and answers founded on the beliefs that all new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge, that all thinking comes from asking questions, and that asking one question should lead to asking further questions.&lt;ref name=Copeland&gt;{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Matt|title=Socratic Circles: Fostering Critical and Creative Thinking in Middle and High School|year=2010|publisher=Stenhouse|location=Portland, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”.&lt;ref name=Litunes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Socratic Circle|url=http://www.corndancer.com/tunes/tunes_print/soccirc.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach is based on the belief that participants seek and gain deeper understanding of concepts in the text through thoughtful dialogue rather than memorizing information that has been provided for them.&lt;ref name=Litunes /&gt; While Socratic Circles can differ in structure, and even in name, they typically involve the following components: a passage of text that students must read beforehand and two concentric circles of students: an outer circle and an inner circle. The inner circle focuses on exploring and analysing the text through the act of questioning and answering. During this phase, the outer circle remains silent. Students in the outer circle are much like scientific observers watching and listening to the conversation of the inner circle. When the text has been fully discussed and the inner circle is finished talking, the outer circle provides feedback on the dialogue that took place. This process alternates with the inner circle students going to the outer circle for the next meeting and vice versa. The length of this process varies depending on the text used for the discussion. The teacher may decide to alternate groups within one meeting, or they may alternate at each separate meeting.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman&gt;{{cite web|title=Furman: Socratic Seminar|url=http://furman.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/7/6/5176248/socratic_seminar_-_guidance_from_avid.pdf|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant difference between this activity and most typical classroom activities involves the role of the teacher. In Socratic Circles the students lead the discussion and questioning. The teacher's role is to ensure the discussion advances regardless of the particular direction the discussion takes.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

====Various approaches to Socratic Circles====

Teachers use Socratic Circles in different ways. The structure it takes may look different in each classroom. While this is not an exhaustive list, teachers may use one of the following structures to administer Socratic Seminar:

# '''Inner/outer circle or fishbowl''': Students need to be arranged in inner and outer circles. The inner circle engages in discussion about the text. The outer circle observes the inner circle, while taking notes. The outer circle shares their [[observations]] and questions the inner circle with guidance from the teacher/facilitator. Students use constructive [[criticism]] as opposed to making judgements. The students on the outside keep track of topics they would like to discuss as part of the debrief. Participants of the outer circle can use an observation checklist or notes form to monitor the participants in the inner circle. These tools will provide structure for listening and give the outside members specific details to discuss later in the seminar.&lt;ref name=Copeland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; The teacher may also sit in the circle but at the same height as the students.&lt;ref name=Chowning&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ting Chowning|first=Jeanne|title=Socratic Seminars in Science Class|journal=[[The Science Teacher]] | publisher = [[National Science Teachers Association]]|date=October 2009|volume=76|issue=7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Triad''': Students are arranged so that each participant (called a “pilot”) in the inner circle has two “co-pilots” sitting behind them on either side. Pilots are the speakers because they are in the inner circle; co-pilots are in the outer circle and only speak during consultation. The seminar proceeds as any other seminar. At a point in the seminar, the [[facilitator]] pauses the discussion and instructs the triad to talk to each other. Conversation will be about topics that need more in-depth discussion or a question posed by the leader. Sometimes triads will be asked by the facilitator to come up with a new question. Any time during a triad conversation, group members can switch seats and one of the co-pilots can sit in the pilot’s seat. Only during that time is the switching of seats allowed. This structure allows for students to speak, who may not yet have the confidence to speak in the large group. This type of seminar involves all students instead of just the students in the inner and outer circles.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;
# '''Simultaneous seminars''': Students are arranged in multiple small groups and placed as far as possible from each other. Following the guidelines of the Socratic Seminar, students engage in small group discussions. Simultaneous seminars are typically done with experienced students who need little guidance and can engage in a discussion without assistance from a teacher/facilitator. According to the literature, this type of seminar is beneficial for teachers who want students to explore a variety of texts around a main issue or topic. Each small group may have a different text to read/view and discuss. A larger Socratic Seminar can then occur as a discussion about how each text corresponds with one another. Simultaneous Seminars can also be used for a particularly difficult text. Students can work through different issues and key passages from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gose|first=Michael|title=When Socratic Dialogue is Flagging: Questions and Strategies for Engaging Students|journal=College Teaching|date=January 2009|volume=57|issue=1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No matter what structure the teacher employs, the basic premise of the seminar/circles is to turn partial control and direction of the classroom over to the students. The seminars encourage students to work together, creating meaning from the text and to stay away from trying to find a correct interpretation. The emphasis is on critical and creative thinking.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;

====Text selection====

;Socratic Circle texts

A Socratic Circle text is a tangible document that creates a thought-provoking discussion.&lt;ref name=NPC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paideia Seminar: active thinking through dialogue centre. 3.4 Planning step 3: Select text|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/paideia/6901|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The text ought to be appropriate for the participants' current level of intellectual and social development.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chorzempa|first=Barbara|author2=Lapidus, Laurie |title=To Find Yourself, Think For Yourself|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=January 2009|volume=41|issue=3|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the anchor for dialogue whereby the [[facilitator]] can bring the participants back to the text if they begin to digress. Furthermore, the seminar text enables the participants to create a level playing field – ensuring that the dialogical tone within the classroom remains consistent and pure to the subject or topic at hand.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Some practitioners argue that "texts" do not have to be confined to printed texts, but can include artifacts such as objects, physical spaces, and the like.

'''Pertinent elements of an effective Socratic text'''

Socratic seminar texts are able to challenge participants’ thinking skills by having these characteristics:

#Ideas and values
#Complexity and challenge
#Relevance to participants' curriculum
#[[Ambiguity]]

1. '''Ideas and values''' -
The text must introduce ideas and values that are complex and difficult to summarize.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Powerful discussions arise from personal connections to abstract ideas and from implications to personal values.

2. '''Complexity and challenge''' -
The text must be rich in ideas and complexity &lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; and open to interpretation.&lt;ref name=Mangrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangrum|first=Jennifer|title=Sharing Practice Through Socratic Seminars|journal=Kappan|date=April 2010|volume=91|issue=7|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally it should require multiple readings,&lt;ref name=FHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Facing History and Ourselves: Socratic Seminar|url=http://www.facinghistory.org/resources/strategies/socratic-seminar|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but should be neither far above the participants' intellectual level nor very long.

3. '''Relevance to participants and curriculum''' -
An effective text has identifiable themes that are recognizable and pertinent to the lives of the participants.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa /&gt; Themes in the text should relate to the curriculum.

4. '''Ambiguity''' -
The text must be approachable from a variety of different perspectives, including perspectives that seem mutually exclusive, thus provoking critical thinking and raising important questions. The absence of right and wrong answers promotes a variety of discussion and encourages individual contributions.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=FHO /&gt;

'''Two different ways to select a text'''

Socratic texts can be divided into two main categories:

1. Print texts (e.g. short stories, poems, and essays) and non-print texts (e.g. photographs, sculptures, and maps); and

2. Subject area, which can draw from print or non-print artifacts. As examples, language arts can be approached through poems, history through written or oral historical speeches, science through policies on environmental issues, math through mathematical proofs, health through nutrition labels, and physical education through fitness guidelines.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt;

====Questioning methods in Socratic Circles====

Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. [[Socratic questioning]] is used to help students apply the activity to their learning. The [[pedagogy]] of Socratic questions is open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt; The questioning technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.

Socratic circles generally start with an open-ended question proposed either by the leader or by another participant.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa /&gt; There is no designated first speaker; as individuals participate in Socratic circles, they gain [[experience]] that enables them to be effective in this role of initial questioner.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

The leader keeps the topic focused by asking a variety of questions about the text itself, as well as questions to help clarify positions when arguments become confused. The leader also seeks to coax reluctant participants into the discussion, and to limit contributions from those who tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; She or he prompts participants to elaborate on their responses and to build on what others have said. The leader guides participants to deepen, clarify, and paraphrase, and to synthesize a variety of different views.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

The participants share the responsibility with the leader to maintain the quality of the Socratic circle. They listen actively in order to respond effectively to what others have contributed. This teaches the participants to think and speak persuasively using the discussion to support their position.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt; Participants must demonstrate respect for different ideas, thoughts and values, and must not interrupt each other.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

Questions can be created individually or in small groups.&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt; All participants are given the opportunity to take part in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gose|first=Michael|title=When Socratic Dialogue Is Flagging; Questions and Strategies for Engaging Students|journal=College Teaching|year=2009|volume=57|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic Circles specify three types of questions to prepare:

#Opening questions generate discussion at the beginning of the seminar in order to elicit dominant themes.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt;
#Guiding questions help deepen and elaborate the discussion, keeping contributions on topic and encouraging a positive atmosphere and consideration for others.
#Closing questions lead participants to summarize their thoughts and learning&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; and personalize what they’ve discussed.&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
The Socratic method, in the form of [[Socratic questioning]], has been adapted for psychotherapy, most prominently in [[Classical Adlerian psychotherapy]], [[Logotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, Elisabeth, Logotherapy Textbook, 2000, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], [[Cognitive Therapy]]{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=75–85}}{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=286-293}}{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=283-292}} and [[Reality Therapy]]. It can be used to clarify meaning, feeling, and consequences, as well as to gradually unfold insight, or explore alternative actions.

The Socratic method has also recently inspired a new form of applied philosophy: [[socratic dialogue]], also called [[philosophical counseling]]. In Europe [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] is probably the best known practitioner, and [[Michel Weber]] has also proposed another variant of the practice.

In an educational setting, '''standards-based assessment''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edglossary.org/standards-based/|title=Standards-Based Definition|last=Partnership|first=Great Schools|date=2014-01-30|work=The Glossary of Education Reform|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;is [[Educational assessment|assessment]] that relies on the evaluation of student understanding with respect to agreed-upon standards, also known as "outcomes". The standards set the criteria for the successful demonstration of the understanding of a concept or skill.&lt;ref name = "unsw"&gt;{{Citation| author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url = https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/standards-based-assessment|title = Standards-Based Assessment|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of standards-based assessment==

In the [[Outcome-based education|standards-based]] paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eleducation.org/resources/chapter-8-standards-based-grading|title=Leaders of Their Own Learning: Chapter 8: Standards-Based Grading {{!}} EL Education|website=eleducation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, students have the freedom to demonstrate understanding in diverse ways, including (but not limited to) selected response (e.g. multiple choice tests), physical constructions, written responses, and performances. Of course, these are not new types of assessments, nor is the concept of [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated assessment]]. The teacher uses all available observations and quantitative information to summarize learning with reference to a specific standard. With these data, a teacher can formulate the steps or actions that can be taken to gain mastery of a particular concept. That is, it aids in [[assessment for learning]].

One of the key aspects of standards-based assessment is post-assessment feedback. The feedback a student receives from this type of assessment does not emphasizes a score, percentage, or statistical average, but information about the expectations of performance as compared to the standard. A standards-based approach does not necessarily dismiss a summative grade, percentage, or a measure of central tendency (such as a mean, or median). However, an assessment that does not reference or give feedback with respect to a standard would not be standards-based. There is a large body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of appropriate feedback.&lt;ref name = "power"&gt;{{Citation|author = [[John Hattie]]|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Power of Feedback|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of standards-based assessment==

The purpose of standards-based assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/education-assessment-evaluation/standards-based-assessment|title=Standards-based Assessment {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to connect evidence of learning to learning outcomes (the standards). When standards are explicit and clear, the learner becomes aware of his/her achievement with reference to the standards, and the teacher may use assessment data to give meaningful feedback to students about this progress. The awareness of one's own learning allows students to point to a specific standard of achievement and so strengthens self-regulation and meta-cognition, two skills generally understood to be effective learning strategies.&lt;ref name = "metacog"&gt;{{Citation|author = Emily R. Lai|url = http://education.qld.gov.au/staff/development/performance/resources/readings/power-feedback.pdf|title = Metacognition: A Literature Review|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework of the standards-based approach in assessment==

A common approach to standards-based assessment (SBA) is:

* Identify a key fact or important body of knowledge (e.g. a scientific theory, a mathematical relationship), the essential content and concepts.
{{quotation | Example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package (September 2010):
:"It is expected that students will view and demonstrate comprehension of visual texts (e.g., cartoons, illustrations, diagrams, posters)"&lt;ref name="bcgr3"&gt;{{citation|author=British Columbia Ministry of Education|title=Grade 3 Curriculum Package|url=https://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/curric_grade_packages/gr3curric_req.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, British Columbia|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quotation | Example from the New Zealand curriculum document ''Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8'', by the end of year 5:
:"In contexts that require them to solve problems or model situations, students will be able to create, continue, and predict further members of sequential patterns with two variables"&lt;ref name="nzmath1to8"&gt;{{citation |author=New Zealand Ministry of Education|title=Mathematics Standards for Years 1-8|url=https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/3166/47235/file/Maths_Standards_amended_vs3.pdf|website=New Zealand Curriculum Online|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Identify the indicators (i.e. evidence) that students will show when the concept or content has been understood.
{{quotation | Respectively to the example from the British Columbia Grade 3 Curriculum Package:
:"describe key messages and images and relevant details in response to questions or activities"&lt;ref name="bcgr3" /&gt;}}
* Choose a collection of assessments that will allow students to demonstrate the indicators.
* Using a scale or rubric, identify the proficiency of the student with respect to the standard. This progress is made accessible to the learner in order to provide meaningful feedback. Any feedback should be able to provide information on how the proficiency can be improved&lt;ref name="power" /&gt;) and the educator needs to be aware of the effects of praise during feedback.&lt;ref name="APAUsingPraise"&gt;{{citation |author=Carol Dwyer|title=Using Praise to Enhance Student Resilience and Learning Outcomes|url=http://www.apa.org/education/k12/using-praise.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat instruction, assessment and feedback until the student achieves a predetermined level of mastery.

==Hallmarks of standards-based assessment==

* Standards (i.e. learning outcomes) need to be visible and understandable by students
* Tasks, activities and assessments should be clear about which standard is being practiced
* [[Formative assessment]] should be used to give feedback to students about their progress towards a standard
* Assessment in general should be well-designed, accurate and high in [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] to be fair and accessible
* [[Exemplar theory|Exemplars]] should be used to give students an understanding of how achievement against a standard is measured
* [[Rubric (academic)|Rubrics]] should be used to assess performances and constructed responses&lt;ref name = "rubrics"&gt;{{Citation|author = Susan M. Brookhart|url =  http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/112001/chapters/What-Are-Rubrics-and-Why-Are-They-Important%C2%A2.aspx|title = How to Create and Use Rubrics for Formative Assessment and Grading|accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Selective response (e.g. multiple choice) should be used to assess basic understanding and knowledge (as in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]) of a specific standard (or the underlying pre-requisite concepts associated with the standard)

==Geographical Distinctions==

===United States===

A '''standards-based test''' is an assessment based on the outcome-based education or performance-based education philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-bulletin.com/news/58020-01-18-06.html] January 18, 2006 Standards- Based Test draws plan for awareness
Jackie Schlotfeldt News-Bulletin Staff Writer Valencia County News-Bulletin "With the New Mexico Standards Based Assessments just a little over a month away"&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessment is a key part of  the standards reform movement. The first part is to set new, higher standards to be expected of every student. Then the curriculum must be aligned to the new standards. Finally, the student must be assessed if they meet these standards of what every student "must know and be able to do". In the United States, a high school diploma which is given on passing a [[high school graduation examination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/standardized-testing/national-achievement-tests/high-school-graduation-examination|title=High School Graduation Examination {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]] is awarded only when these standards are achieved. It is fully expected that every child will become proficient in all areas of academic skills by the end of a period, typically 10 years in the United States, but sometimes longer, after the passing of education reform bill by a state legislature. The United States federal government, under [[No Child Left Behind]] can further require that all schools must demonstrate improvement among all students, even if they are already all over proficient.

====Holistic grading====
Rather than using computers to log responses to multiple choice tests, [[rubrics (education)|rubrics]] for  state assessments such as in North Carolina &lt;ref&gt;AFT - Hot Topics - Standards-Based Reform  North Carolina Focused Holistic Scoring Guide: The Expository Composition Grade 7, [http://www.aft.org/topics/sbr/NC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ask scorers to look at the entire paper and make judgments. Scorers are not allowed to count errors, and rubrics do not contain numeric measurements of how many spelling or grammar error constitute a "1" or "2". The Analytical Writing section of the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] test is scored using a six-point holistic scale in half-point increments.&lt;ref&gt;GRE Update - March 2006 The Analytical Writing section of the General Test will continue to be scored using the six-point holistic scale in half-point increments [http://www.ets.org/Media/Newsletters/GRE/2006/0601_scale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Holistic grading is one of the main reason for disagreement between scorers, but for this reason some tests are scored more than once to check for agreement.

====Advantages of Standards-based Assessment====
* Students are compared to a standard that all can reach, rather than artificially ranked into a [[Grading on a curve|bell curve]] where some students must be called failures, and only a few are allowed to ''succeed''
* Humans, not computers can evaluate the entire value of a response rather than imposing a strict right or wrong that is not open to interpretation
* Free response uses and tests for [[higher order thinking skills|higher order thinking]], which is important in most new [[education standards]].
* Computer scored [[multiple choice]] tests have been shown to have deleterious effects for minorities, unfairly denying opportunities.
* Only a standards-based test is aligned with standards-based education reform, which is based on a belief that all students can succeed, not only a few.
* Passing a 10th grade test and awarding a Certificate of Initial Mastery ensures that all students will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the world-class economy of the twenty-first century.
* Students will no longer be cheated by passing them on to the next grade without obtaining what every child at the grade level must be able to know and do.
* When all students pass all standards, as is the central belief of [[standards-based education reform]], all students from all demographics will achieve the same  test score, eliminating the mysterious [[achievement gap]] which has previously been shown to occur between all groups on all tests. However, as of 2006, no standards-based assessment has yet achieved this optimistic (critics might call it impossible) goal, though many show rising scores.

====Cons====
Compared to a multiple-choice, [[norm-referenced test]], a standards-based test can be recognized by:

* A cut score is determined for different levels of performance. There are no cut scores for norm-referenced tests. There is no failing score on the [[SAT|SAT test]]. Each college or institution sets their own score standards for admission or awards.
* Different levels of performance are set. Typically these are Above Standard, Meets Standard, Below Standard. These levels a typically set in a benchmarking process, even though such a process does not take into an account whether the test items are even appropriate for the grade level.
* Tests are [[Holistic grading|holistically graded]] against a free-written response, often with pictures, rather than graded correct or incorrect among multiple choices.
* Tests are more expensive to grade because of this, typically $25–30 per test compared to $2–$5, not including the cost of developing the test, typically different every year for every state.
* Tests are more difficult to grade because they are typically graded against a handful with no more than one or two example papers at each scoring level. They cannot be graded by computer
* Tests are less reliable. Agreement may fall between 60 and 80 percent on a 4-point scale and be considered to be accurate.
* Graders do not need teaching credentials, only a bachelor's degree in any field, and are typically paid $8 to $11 per hour for part-time work.
* Failure rates as high as 80 to 95 percent are not only not unusual, they are fully expected and announced as test programs are introduced to the local press. Under traditional graduation criteria, African Americans had achieved national graduation rates within a few points of whites. In 2006, three-quarters of African Americans who failed the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] were promised by Superintendent [[Terry Bergeson]] that they would not get a diploma if they did not pass retakes of the test in two years, even though she had pledged earlier that "all students" would get a world class diploma.
* Failure rates for minorities and special education students are typically two to four times higher than for majority groups as extended response questions are more difficult to answer than multiple choice
* Content is often difficult even for adults to quickly answer, even at grade levels as low as the fourth grade, especially in mathematics. Professor [[Don Orlich]] called the [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] a "disaster", with math and science tests falling well above the normal development level of students at many grade levels.
* Mathematics has a high proportion of statistics and geometry, and a low content of simple arithmetic.
* Schools are scored as zero for students who do not take the test.
* Passing such a test at the 10th grade level is typically planned as being required for graduating high school.
* Passing such a test, rather than the 50th percentile, is defined as [[Educational stages|grade level]] performance.
* A question with a correct answer may be graded as incorrect if it does not show how the answer as arrived at. A question with an incorrect numerical conclusion may not necessarily be graded as wrong.&lt;ref&gt;1997 WASL math released problems&lt;/ref&gt;
* California's first year of the CLAS test permitted no '4' high math grades, not even in the highest scoring schools, in order to leave room for improvement&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Maureen DiMarco to Washington State legislators&lt;/ref&gt;
* The North Carolina Writing project gave out less than 1 percent exemplary '4' scores. Such papers employed vocabulary and knowledge on a level sometimes exceeding that of the college graduate graders, and well above the intended audience of a high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;At a grading session in Auburn in 2004, no graders could identify some of the words used in some papers&lt;/ref&gt; This level would be even more difficult than achieving an SAT score sufficient for entry into an Ivy League private college.
* Scores typically rise much faster than standardized tests such as NAEP or SAT given over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rand study of Kentucky KIRIS&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related standards ==

In 1974, the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] was charged with the responsibility of writing a companion volume to the 1974 revision of the ''Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests''.{{ref|AERAnewsletter}} This companion volume was to deal with issues and standards for [[program evaluation|program]] and [[curriculum]] [[evaluation]] in [[education]]. In 1975, the Joint Committee began work and ultimately decided to establish three separate sets of standards. These standards include ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Personnel Evaluation Standards|The Personnel Evaluation Standards]]'', ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Program Evaluation Standards|The Program Evaluation Standards]]'', and ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Student Evaluation Standards|The Student Evaluation Standards]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11380">'''The First-Year Experience (FYE)''' (also known as the '''Freshman-Year Experience''' or the '''Freshman Seminar Program''') is a program at many [[United States|American]] [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] designed to help students prepare for the transition from [[high school]] to college. FYE programs often foster the participation of students in co-curricular events such as [[Common reading|common reads]], concerts, art exhibits, and guest lectures.

Depending on the school, the course can last anywhere from two weeks to a full school year. Some larger universities, such as the [[University at Albany, SUNY]], through their Project Renaissance Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm "Project Renaissance Program,"] SUNY Albany website.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222220622/http://www.albany.edu/projren/info/info.htm |date=December 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;create a "small college" feel by allowing freshmen to do their first-year courses in one section of the university. 

While the origins of the program remain unclear, many people attribute the start of the First-Year Seminar to the [[University of South Carolina]], which houses the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition and holds a series of workshops for colleges and universities to better their own first-year programs.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

== History ==
Originally, Boston College was where the first Freshman Orientation class was offered in the year 1888. Reed College, based in Portland, Oregon, was the first institution to offer a course for credit when, in 1911, they offered a course that was divided into men-only and women-only sections that met for 2 hours per week for the year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigger|first1=Jessica|title=Improving the Odds for Freshman Success|url=http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advising-first-year-students.aspx|website=Nacada Clearinghouse|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, [[University of South Carolina]] President Thomas Jones faced campus unrest and violence. In the aftermath he vowed to create a new course designed to "bond students to the institution and transform the way that undergraduate students were taught."&lt;ref name=FYE-history&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/fye/center/history.html "Our History,"] University of South Carolina National Resource Center for The First-Year Experience and Students in Transition website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Carolina introduced "University 101," designed to "improve the educational experiences of first-year college students."&lt;ref name=FYE-history /&gt;

Carolina's program became a model for colleges and universities across the country, and in 1982, representatives from 175 schools came to Carolina to meet about the first-year experience. In 1983, Carolina's University 101 faculty director, John N. Gardner, organized the first Annual Conference on the Freshman Year Experience. 

In 1986, Carolina partnered with the [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Polytechnic]] to produce the first International Conference on the First-Year Experience. Also in 1986, Carolina established the National Resource Center; as it broadened its focus it underwent a number of name changes, settling on the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition in 1998. As the Center states on its website:
{{blockquote|Today, the Center collaborates with its institutional partner, University 101 Programs, in pursuit of its mission to advance and support efforts to improve student learning and transitions into and through higher education. Through its work with conferences and continuing education, a full complement of publications, the pursuit of a research agenda, and the creation and dissemination of online resources, the Center has grown to become the trusted expert, internationally recognized leader, and clearinghouse for scholarship, policy, and best practice for the first-year experience and all post-secondary student transitions.&lt;ref name=FYE-history /&gt;}}

== Typical structure  ==
Many of the colleges and universities that use the program require that all incoming freshmen take the freshman seminar; other schools have the program as optional, but recommended. Most first-year seminars are a semester long and start at [[student orientation]]. From orientation, students enroll in the course, which gives them a variety of college experiences, from tours of the campus to a breakdown of how to study for tests. Many schools even offer students help with purchasing books from the school's bookstore.

For instance, as part of [[Mitchell College]]'s First-Year Experience (FYE) program for transitioning into college, first-year students are assigned to Freshman Interest Groups (FIGs) in their first semester according to a common academic interest or major. These groups explore the topics and issues related to their chosen path. Those who arrive at Mitchell undecided about their academic route are also grouped together to allow for a broader survey of options. Students are encouraged to communicate their unique perspective and make connections through co-curricular activities.

[[Colby College]]'s outdoor orientation COOT (Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips) program is designed to ease new students' transition into college and introduce them to [[Maine]]'s cultural and natural resources. COOT features an on-campus orientation and a variety of trips, including hiking trips at [[Acadia National Park]] and [[Mount Katahdin]] canoe trips on the [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] and Moose Rivers, and other trips around the state. There are over 60 different trips, designed to appeal to incoming students with a variety of interests and fitness levels, and more "front country" trips have been added in recent years, including service- and arts-oriented options such as an organic farm stay and a challenge course.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.colby.edu/administration_cs/dos/coot/index.cfm "Colby Outdoor Orientation Trips,"] Colby College website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; COOT leaders are chosen from upperclass students who apply for these positions, and are expected to help the students both during and after the trip with the adjustment to campus life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In 1991, [[Norman Adler]] initiated the Penn Reading Project at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an integrative introduction to liberal learning for college freshmen newly arriving on campus. Subsequently, Freshman [[Common reading|Reading Projects]] have been adopted widely as part of the first-year experience at many college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.www.upenn.edu/themeyear/proof/prp-archive-overview.html "PRP Archive,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713154132/https://secure.www.upenn.edu/themeyear/proof/prp-archive-overview.html |date=2015-07-13 }} University of Pennsylvania website. Accessed June 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program credits ==
As a standard for most first-year seminars, many colleges give students one to two credits for completing the program, such as [[UC Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freshmanseminar.uci.edu/ "Freshman Seminar Program,"] UC Irvine website. Accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools, such as the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]] in [[Old Westbury, New York]], merge the program into a second course which helps to satisfy [[New York (state)|New York]]'s general education requirement.{{cn|date=May 2015}} In addition, the school recently introduced its Civic Engagement program, which is designed to allow students to participate in [[community service]] as a part of its First-Year Experience program.

== Workshops and training ==
The University of South Carolina hosts a seminar every year in which the many colleges and universities which have the First-Year Program get together to improve their own programs,  and to offer suggestions to their colleagues on how they might also improve. The workshop is usually a week long and attendance is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/univ101/ "University 101 Programs,"] University of South Carolina website. Accessed May 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
The [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]'s [[First-Year Experience]] program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101). The program aims to assist students in discovering their purpose, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with a plan for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six [[appreciative advising]] stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson, B.L; Atwood, J.A. (November 2006). "Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first-semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first-semester GPA of 2.72.

J.N. Gardner, member of The Journal of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers and author of The freshman-year experience, emphasized the importance of having courses that focus on the first few weeks of college. During this time is most likely when students will make the decision to drop-out, due to the increase of feeling personal independence and habit forming, as well as forming relationships that they will continue throughout their college careers.  Gardner also suggested that things such as curriculum modifications, academic advisement, faculty led freshmen level courses instead of graduate student led, living/learning environments, peer counseling, and special freshmen administrative units improve the student’s freshman year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigger|first1=Jessica|title=Improving the Odds for Freshman Success|url=http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Advising-first-year-students.aspx|website=Nacada Clearinghouse|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transitus''' is the name given to a year in a number of [[independent schools]] in [[Scotland]]. As the name would suggest, this year is offered as a bridge between '[[primary school|primary]]' and '[[secondary school|secondary]]' education.

Transitus replaces the final year of primary education used in [[state schools]], often referred to as Primary 7 (P7). In [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory schools]], it may also share the 'P7' designation, although in this case it is instead the abbreviation of 'Prep'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglasgowacademy.org.uk/ntga/prep/p57.html Prep School - Prep 5-7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121145027/http://www.theglasgowacademy.org.uk/ntga/prep/p57.html |date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">The '''Volvo effect''' is a term used in critiquing [[standardized testing]] that was created by Peter Sacks in his 2001 book ''Standardized Minds''. The term has been picked up by other sociologists, and counting [[Volvo cars|Volvos]] has even been facetiously proposed as an alternative method to the spending millions of dollars on standardized testing.&lt;ref&gt;For instance in ''The Unintended Consequences of High-Stakes Testing'' by M. Gail Jones, Brett D. Jones and Tracy Y. Hargrove.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original text in which the Volvo effect was advanced:

{{cquote|Although standardized tests have a relatively bleak record of predicting success in school and work, we know that they do tend to correlate exceedingly well with the income and education of one's parents. Call it the "Volvo Effect." The data is so strong in this regard that one could make a good guess about a child's standardized test scores by simply looking at how many degrees her parents have and what kind of car they drive.&lt;ref&gt;''Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing Culture and What We Can Do to Change It'' by Peter Sacks, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7382-0433-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20561">'''Writing about Writing (WAW)''', is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines [[first-year composition]] as an "introduction to writing studies." This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the ''how'' of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."

==History==
Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.&lt;ref name= Carter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Shannon|title=Writing about Writing in Basic Writing: A Teacher/Researcher/Activist Narrative|journal=Basic Writing e-journal|origyear=2009|year=2010|volume=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions"===
In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed.  This course sought "to improve students' understanding of writing, [[rhetoric]], language, and literacy" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging "more realistic conceptions of writing."  &lt;ref name= DownsWardle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies']|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=58|issue=4|pages=552–584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.

In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that "writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt;

The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about "writing studies", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.

The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write "rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt; Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.

==="Continuing the Dialogue"===
After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled "Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting
Misconceptions.'" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being "that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit."&lt;ref name= follow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Elizabeth|title=Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write, "Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand."&lt;ref name=follow /&gt; Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing ''major'' and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, ''Writing about Writing: A College Reader'', which was published in 2011.

==Benefits==
In "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:&lt;ref name=DownsWardle /&gt;
*an increased self-awareness about writing
*improved reading abilities
*improved confidence as a student
*raised awareness of research writing as conversation

WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article "Writing about Writing in [[Basic writing|Basic Writing]]," Shannon Carter explains "a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt; She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.

Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled "Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students," Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, "Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products."&lt;ref name= Jonikka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Jonkka|title=Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students|journal=Basic Writing Online|origyear=2009|year=2012|volume=8/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and responses==
As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and "often in fundamental ways." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

In his response to Downs and Wardle's "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.

Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend "the nuances of the composing process." He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, "While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more." &lt;ref name= Kutney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kutney|first=Joshua P.|title=Will Writing Awareness Transfer to Writing Performance? Response to Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle, 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=59|issue=10|pages=276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's "dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge",&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Libby|title=Interchanges: Commenting on Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=59|issue=3|pages=503–511|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their "research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once."&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Downs published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out:&lt;blockquote&gt; My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to "FYC as Intro to Writing Studies" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.&lt;ref name=Downs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|title=Response to Miles et al.|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He writes Miles et al. "seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner." His main contentions are:&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;
*Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did.
*There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major.
*Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is.
*In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an "admirable goal" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is "unnecessarily limiting."
He concludes by writing "I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities."&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;

A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be "lone pioneers" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference [[Peter Elbow]] as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slomp|first=David H.|author2=M. Elizabeth Sargent |title=Responses to Responses: Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2009|volume=60|issue=1|pages=171–175|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0603-feb09/CCC0603ResponseTeaching.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be "off-putting" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in "recruiting" more students to become majors in the field.&lt;ref name= Jonikka /&gt;

==''Writing about Writing: A College Reader''==
Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as "encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy." &lt;ref name=Bedford&gt;Bedford St. Martin's, [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writingaboutwriting-firstedition-wardle/ Writing about Writing] 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a "smart choice" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:&lt;ref name=WAW&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Writing about Writing: A College Reader|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*WAW engages students in a relevant subject
*WAW engages students' own area of expertise
*WAW helps students transfer what they learn
*WAW has been extensively class tested—and it works.

The book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write?  How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.&lt;ref name=WAW /&gt;

The '''Youth Training Scheme''' ('''YTS''') was the name in the [[United Kingdom]] of an on-the-job [[training]] course for school leavers aged 16 and 17 and was managed by the [[Manpower Services Commission]]. The scheme was first outlined in the 1980 [[white paper]] ''A New Training Initiative: A Programme for Action'', and it was brought into operation in 1983 to replace the [[Youth Opportunities Programme]] by the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Initially lasting one year or 6 months, the scheme was amended in 1986 to be so that it could be extended to two years.

The [[1981 England riots]] encouraged that, by bringing into sharp focus the results of large numbers of unskilled unemployed finding their own solutions.
The scheme promised training to its applicants and made use of a variety of different training locales such as businesses, colleges of [[further education]] or training workshops run by voluntary organisations. Since the training place was guaranteed by the government and trainees were to be paid if they were on the course, eligibility for [[social security]] [[unemployment benefit]] was withdrawn.

Accredited organisations were required to provide at least 13 weeks per year of training away from the job and include life skills and social skills. A standardised form of certification was issued at the end of the training period.

In 1989, it was renamed '''Youth Training''' and was placed under the management of local [[Training and Enterprise Council]]s. The trainees on the schemes could be classified as either trainee status or employed status.

The difference was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with training for the company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their training allowance improved by the employer.

== Criticism ==
The YTS attracted political and social criticism from an early point. Critics claimed that the scheme enabled employers to exploit school leavers for cheap labour, and it provided little substance in the way of genuine education. The broad left alliance of musicians, artists, comedians and writers, 
[[Red Wedge]], criticised YTS for its discriminatory nature toward black people and women.&lt;ref&gt;“A State of Independence”, Fact Not Fiction Series, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The government's line was that the scheme was an effective counter to the drop in [[apprenticeship]]s and marked rise in youth unemployment that was seen in the early 1980s.
