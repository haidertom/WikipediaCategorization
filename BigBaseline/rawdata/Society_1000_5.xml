'''''1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed''''' is a nonfiction ancient history book written by [[Eric H. Cline]] and published in 2014 by [[Princeton University Press]]. The book focuses on his hypothesis for the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of civilization,  a transition period that affected the Egyptians, [[Hittites]], [[Canaanites]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], Minoans, [[Mycenaeans]], Assyrians and Babylonians; varied heterogeneous cultures populating eight powerful and flourishing states intermingling via trade, commerce, exchange and "cultural piggybacking", despite "all the difficulties of travel and time".&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; He presents evidence to support a "perfect storm" of "multiple interconnected failures", meaning that more than one natural and man-made cataclysm caused the disintegration and demise of an ancient civilization that incorporated "empires and globalized peoples".&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt;&lt;ref name=prince/&gt; This ended the [[Bronze Age]], and ended the Mycenaean, Minoan, Trojan, Hittite, and Babylonian cultures.&lt;ref name=prince/&gt; Before this book, the leading hypothesis during previous decades attributed the civilization collapse mostly to [[Sea Peoples]] of unknown origin.&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23321">Uganda is one of the few Sub-Saharan African countries that has adopted [[abstinence-only sex education]] as an approach of [[sexual education]] that emphasizes [[abstinence]] from [[sexual intercourse]] until marriage as the only option. Abstinence-only sex education does not include joint curriculum covering other options including [[safe sex]] practices, [[family planning]], and is espoused as the only sure way to avoid pregnancy and [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s. [[Uganda]] is commonly recognized as an exemplary case of lowering the rate of [[HIV]] prevalence &lt;ref name=HRW2003&gt;Cohen, J., &amp; Tate, T. (2005). [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uganda0305.pdf  The less they know the better. Abstinence-only HIV/AIDS programs in Uganda] pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prevalence figures may have also been distorted by the lack of treatment, meaning that the percentage of infected is decreased by disproportionately early deaths.  Abstinence-only sex education has been implemented and supported for this cause to a large degree in Uganda, to some controversy. Critics have questioned its effectiveness in lowering HIV/AIDS transmission.  They have also highlighted [[discrimination]], [[gender inequality]] and [[social stigma]] as the outcomes of the program in Uganda.

==Origins==
In the wake of an increase of [[HIV]] prevalence in Uganda since it first appeared in 1982,&lt;ref name=Stoneburner2004&gt;Stoneburner, R. L., &amp; Low-Beer, D. (2004). Population-level HIV declines and behavioural risk avoidance in Uganda. Science, 304(5671), 714&amp;ndash;718.&lt;/ref&gt; many programs were introduced to lower incidence of HIV and educate about the disease. [[Abstinence-only sex education]] was implemented as one way to quell the spread of HIV/AIDS, in addition to creating a positive behaviour change to the same end over time.&lt;ref name=Stoneburner2004/&gt; As the epidemic became known on the international scene, money and resources from many nations flooded Africa in general and Uganda in particular. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda in the late 1990s onward was largely financed by the United States and independent faith-based organizations &lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

==Programs==
===Abstinence, Be faithful, use a Condom (ABC)===
The ABC approach was introduced during the US-Ugandan efforts to propose Abstinence-only as a way to lower HIV transmission.  ABC is an acronym, A being [[Abstinence]], B being [[monogamy|Be Faithful]], and C being [[Condom]] use.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; It would seem that this form of abstinence-only includes some education and encouragement of condoms, but the application of ABC is disaggregated for specific populations. The breakdown is Abstinence for people not yet married, Be Faithful for those in marriages, and Condom Use only for people that are already infected or are in a marriage where one person is infected.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

ABC has evolved since its inception to a program known as AB, released in 2004 as an official abstinence-only education program for Uganda specifically. AB has lessened the emphasis on condoms due to the confusing nature of teaching the two simultaneously and the fear that condoms undermine the message of abstinence.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;  AB is criticized for its lack of follow-through of collecting data on whether participants are abstaining or not.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; The main source of data collected for AB is the number of AB rallies, organizations and discussions concerning AB, instead of the behavioural changes proposed by AB. Therefore, AB is difficult to monitor as the true success of the programs aims for abstinence and social modifications, but no data is kept.

===Condoms, Needles, and Negotiation (CNN)===
Condoms, Needles and Negotiations was born out of the necessity of failing marital [[monogamy]]. CNN stands for Condoms, Needles and Negotiation. In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Uganda included, married women in monogamous relationships are at a disadvantage due to the lack of rights within marriage, [[bargaining power]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=CNN2005&gt;Sinding, S. W. (2005). Does ‘CNN’(condoms, needles and negotiation) work better than 'ABC'(abstinence, being faithful and condom use) in attacking the AIDS epidemic. International Family Planning Perspectives, 31(1), 38&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt; The need was discovered as most new HIV cases come from HIV women contracting the disease in their marriage through their husbands. In this way, AB abstinence-only education falls short for protecting the lives of those practicing it. The Condoms part of CNN is two-fold to reduce condom stigma and promote use within the B (Be Faithful) section of AB.  Women are still practicing faithfulness, but in order to protect their health, they still need to be able to understand and use condoms. The next N in CNN covers needle exchange, which doesn't relate to abstinence-only sex education.  But the third N stands for Negotiation, which again plays a part for individuals practicing faithfulness who could still be harmed.  Negotiation informs partners of the risks they might encounter if their partner is not being monogamous and teaches them skills to bargain in their position in the relationship.

===Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth (PIASCY)===
In 2001, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] introduced his official program for sex education for the youth of Uganda, Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth, abbreviated as PIASCY. PIASCY mainly targets primary schools, secondary schools and after school youth rallies with materials and instruction (HRW, 29). The main focus of PIASCY is for young people to empower themselves to delay their sexual relations until marriage through abstinence. PIASCY is primarily funded through the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], both of which provide many other services outside of finances to support the program. In addition, PIASCY has since become a foundation feature in the United States’ President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR).&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

====Primary schools====
The medium for primary school involvement with PIASCY is a combination of manuals, instruction for teachers to relay to students, as well as materials given directly to the students based upon their age/grade.  An assembly is normally held twice a month school wide for teachers to give presentations outlined from the curriculum within the PIASCY manuals.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; The first message is the choice of abstinence and its benefits, but subsequent lessons can include teachings of self-esteem and how to be above peer-pressure.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; Although other parts of PIASCY include correct condom application and uses, at the primary level, abstinence-only is the majority of the message.

====Secondary schools====
In 2004, the Ugandan government incorporated PIASCY in secondary schools, in the form of handouts for students as well as teachers.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; The curriculum is disseminated in the classroom format on a regular basis.  The secondary school level information was drafted to include age sensitive subjects such as [[masturbation]], [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]], but was met with strong opposition from many powerful, yet undisclosed, groups in Uganda and the United States.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;  In addition, draft copies of the secondary school handouts contained misleading and inaccurate information about condoms and HIV prevention.  Furthermore, condoms were encouraged after marriage as HIV prevention, but did not explain how this differed with unmarried youth.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;  The final drafts did include rudimentary instruction on condoms without the corresponding photos.

====Out-of-school programs====
PIASCY also has a significant section of their focus targeting youth that are not in school by holding rallies and events after school or outside of school. In Uganda, there are significant amounts of youth that are not enrolled in school, despite the recent movements to educate everyone. Although these events are generally held on a school campus or facility, anyone aged 15–30, student or not can participate.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; These events generally have speakers who are as diverse as the President of Uganda to religious leaders.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;  In more rural areas, these serve to disseminate important abstinence messages but have been criticized as supporting an agenda of re-election and political messages and including inaccurate information about condoms and abstinence. After the formal rallies and programs, it is made aware that political leaders are around to take questions that youth may have about the current government.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;  PEPFAR, an organization providing funding to PIASCY, outlines promotion of information, prevention and treatment of HIV, and is in contradiction with the political agenda and misleading information sometimes found in the PIASCY after school programs.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

===Faith-based organizations===
In Uganda, there are a number of faith-based organizations that provide abstinence-only education to youth.  Many of these are financed and supported by not only the Ugandan Government, but also the United States. In general, these are based on Christian beliefs, as 60% of Ugandans are Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch interview, Kampala, November 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====National (Uganda) Youth Forum====
The National Youth Forum was founded by one of the nation's largest activists for abstinence-only sex education, first lady [[Janet Museveni]]. The primary objective for the National Youth Forum (NYF) is to coordinate assemblies where young boys and girls pledge to stay sexually pure until marriage. More than 70, 000 Ugandan youths have committed to this through NYF.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Museveni, "The AIDS Pandemic: Saving the Next Generation," World Congress of Families, New York, May 3, 2002, http://www.worldcongress.org (retrieved January 11, 2005). Anne Mugisa, "Janet to Host 70,000 Virgins," The New Vision, December 1, 2004, http://allafrica.com (retrieved December 2, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; NYF and Museveni advocate abstinence-only education in its most exclusive form, even pushing the notion that condoms are inadequate in preventing HIV and education involving them promote sexual activity among youth.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; She has gone so far as to propose a nationwide testing of young boys and girls for virginity, although this has not come to pass. Ms. Museveni's organization NYF also obtains funding from the American government.&lt;ref&gt;Priya Abraham, "Hooked on Failure Africa: In Africa’s Fight Against AIDS, the United States Continues to Support Family-Planning Groups that Stifle the White House Abstinence and Fidelity Message," World
Magazine, November 6, 2004, http://www.worldmag.com (retrieved December 8, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship has been called under scrutiny on the grounds that UNF Proselytizing and the laws of the United States regarding the secular nature of congressional funding.&lt;ref&gt;A December 2002 executive order governing federal funding of community and faith-based organizations states that, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution's separation of church and state, "organizations that engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, and proselytization, must offer those services separately in time or location from any programs or services supported with direct Federal financial assistance." Executive Order 13279—Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community
Organizations, Federal Register, vol. 67, no. 241, December 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Makerere Community Church====
The Makerere Community Church is another national leader in the abstinence-only push. [[Martin Ssempa]], who is one of the writers of the Ugandan AB policy, directs the church and foundation.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; Ssempa leads the fundamentalist Makerere Christian Church and his policies fall in line.  He takes a more extreme version of abstinence only sex education, sometimes speaking out directly against condoms and women's rights.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; His is a more outlying approach to abstinence-only and the lifestyle that he connects with it.

====Family Life Network====
The [[Family Life Network]] is a [[non-profit organization]] that teaches abstinence-only techniques alongside value based sexual education. Since 2002, they have reached at least 130,000 students in over 400 schools.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; A tactic readily put into place is  to create abstinence-only in the public discussion is a  signing of "True Love Waits" cards to pledge abstinence until marriage.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; Stephen Langa, the executive director, defines the Family Life Network as having four goals: bring back faith in the marriage institution; show the danger of sexual involvement; warn children on the dangers of [[globalization]], such as [[pornography]]; and ask children to make a commitment of abstinence.  Although Langa does not actively speak out against condom use, his beliefs when questioned contain false information about the protection provided by condoms against sperm and HIV transference.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; The Family Life Network receives money from foreign and Ugandan donors, but has not in the past received any contributions from the United States or PEPFAR.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Looking at the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education, it can’t be measured in the knowledge received from the education, but instead the translation to the decisions that stem from the education. Three of these are STI/HIV prevention, the levels of teenagers participating in sexual activity and unplanned pregnancies.

In terms of lowering new infection rates of STIs and HIV in particular, there is a mixed opinion on the influence of abstinence only.  [[Edward C. Green]], frequently consults for [[USAID]] has been published remarking that abstinence-only was the main proponent of the lowering of [[HIV/AIDS in Uganda|HIV/AIDS infection in Uganda]] and that condoms were not effective.&lt;ref name=Schoepf2003&gt;Schoepf, Brooke Grundfest. "Uganda: lessons for AIDS control in Africa." Review of African Political Economy (2003): 553-572.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, AIDS specialist Sophie Wacasa-Monacco explains that abstinence has played a very important role in the HIV decline, but only in conjunction with comprehensive education.&lt;ref name=Schoepf2003/&gt; It is the knowledge about HIV and STIs in general that allow for people to make educated decisions concerning their body and that of a prospective sexual partner.  Abstinence is a good outlet to avoid sexual behaviour and therefore sexually transmitted infections, but without the full scope of the situation regarding sexual decisions, the consequences can be unclear and misleading.

Abstinence-only sex education encourages youth to delay their sexual début until marriage. Between the years of 1989 and 1995, Uganda saw large success with the employment of abstinence and subsequent HIV infection rates comparatively to their regional neighbours. In males aged 15–24 years old, there was a decrease from 60% to 23% participation in premarital sex.  Similarly, females aged 15–25 saw a decrease from 53% to 16% in 1989 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref name="Stoneburner2004"/&gt; This decrease coincided with a policy called zero-grazing, which emphasizes monogamous relationships and the faithfulness that is implied.  Curiously, there were very few abstinence-only education programs in place during this decrease, despite the choice of abstinence from sexual intercourse having a significant decline.&lt;ref name="Stoneburner2004"/&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education leaves women socially vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Schoepf, B. G. (2003). Uganda: lessons for AIDS control in Africa. Review of African Political Economy, 553–572.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Uganda have a diminished ability to hold dominion over their bodies.  Young women are often coerced into relationships with older men, teachers, or "sugar daddies" that provide them with items that would not be accessible otherwise.&lt;ref name="Schoepf2003"/&gt;  Biologically speaking, if women or men break their abstinence vow, a woman is twice as likely to contract HIV due to her anatomy. Furthermore, abstinence only sex education doesn't teach ways to avoid HIV/AIDS infection after marriage.

In Uganda, married women are one of the highest at risk populations.  One of the biggest concerns is extra-marital sex that brings HIV into a [[seronegative]] relationship, in fact, in Uganda, men are twice as likely to infect their wives in marriage after entering into the relationship as seronegative.  In addition, men are less likely to communicate the fact that they are infected with HIV to their partners.  For example, of men that are hospitalized for HIV/AIDS, only 12% of the wives knew of their husbands' infection.&lt;ref name="Schoepf2003"/&gt;  When seronegative women engage in sexual intercourse with seropositive men, they are twice as likely to contract HIV than men in the same situation.  In this respect, abstinence-only sex education neglects protecting anyone that does participate in sexual acts, and especially women, due to the gender power relations in Uganda.

In abstinence-only sex education, there is not a program within to plan for pregnancy or control birth spacing. As the only tenant is to abstain from sexual relations until marriage, once in marriage this feature is not utilized. In Uganda, there are strict tradition surrounding sex post-partum and while [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=van1988&gt;van de Walle, E., &amp; van de Walle, F. (1988). Birthspacing and abstinence in Sub-Saharan Africa. International Family Planning Perspectives, 14(1), 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum abstinence is a widely held belief and generally practiced.  Unfortunately, this often leads to extramarital intercourse.  In monogamous relationships, 31% of husbands abstain completely.  This remaining 69% look elsewhere for sex, through polygamous relations, sex workers, or casual relationships.&lt;ref name="van1988"/&gt; This abstinent period is not effective in the realm of preventing HIV from entering a seronegative relationship. In addition, in relationships that don't observe the post-partum abstinence, birth spacing becomes non-existent.  In this case, many women find themselves pregnant in quick succession.

==Controversy==
Abstinence-only sex education became quite controversial in the examination of HIV/AIDS and pregnancy prevention due to the common link with morals and proselytizing. Often, abstinence-only sex education is taught from a Christian perspective and creates a connection with [[virginity]] and [[self-worth]]. In many cases, if someone slips from abstaining, they will then view their self-worth as less as they no longer have their virginity, leading to risky sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="van1988"/&gt; Many countries have pulled support for any abstinence-only education due to concerns with the idea of HIV prevention information being coupled with missionary work and message.

Support has also been retracted when abstinence-only sex education was discovered to have been distributing false information regarding condom use and effectiveness. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has reportedly distributed the misinformation that there are tiny pores in condoms that allow the HIV virus to pass through, therefore deeming them unsafe to use against infection.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; It has also been disseminated that condoms are not effective birth control and the chance of getting pregnant is very high.  This information that is easily disproven in the Global North, is difficult to combat in Uganda when it comes from political, spiritual and community leaders.  This further stigmatizes condom use and lowers the likelihood that people engaging in sexual acts will use them. This misinformation is a large proponent against abstinence-only sex education as the organizations implementing the programs are unreliable or have proven to be in the past.

===Socio-economic considerations===
In many situations, the choice to abstain is non-existent. Many young girls and some boys are sex workers, selling their bodies to survive.  In these high-risk environments, the participants do not have the ability to abstain or enter into a faithful monogamous relationship.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt; Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda has been criticized for ignoring the thousands of citizens that are forced into sexual relations and therefore unprotected against HIV/AIDS.  Due to abstinence-only sex education teaching abstinence until marriage as the only option, many sex workers do not know about or use condoms.  This creates a breeding ground for HIV transmission.  Abstinence-only sex education is woefully discriminatory against lower socioeconomic peoples.

Outside of sex work, there exists young women and men that also cannot abstain do to social or financial pressure from older parties that act as "sugar mommies" and "sugar daddies".&lt;ref&gt;Hindin, M. J., &amp; Fatusi, A. O. (2009). Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions. International perspectives on sexual and reproductive health, 35(2), 58-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young men and women engage in sexual relationships in order to obtain items, treats or opportunities that they would not be able to otherwise receive. Abstinence-only sex education in Uganda disregards the existence of these relationships and does not provide any program or policy to protect against HIV/AIDS infection.

===Non-recognized unions===
Another criticism levelled at abstinence-only sex education in Uganda is the limiting language and subsequent exclusion that the policy promotes when addressing [[LGBT|lesbian, gay and bisexual]] (LGB) people. Abstinence-only sex education teaches to abstain from sex until marriage to a faithful partner. In Uganda, [[same-sex marriage]] is not recognized, and gay people can be penalized for [[coming out]]. In this way, some believe that abstinence-only sex education in Uganda discriminates against [[LGBT|LGB]] individuals and does not provide them with adequate tools to combat [[HIV/AIDS]] infection.&lt;ref name=HRW2003/&gt;

===Mutual exclusivity===
Critics of [[abstinence-only sex education]] have made the point that abstinence-only truly curbs education and a well-rounded knowledge to fight HIV/AIDS infection.  The implied mutual exclusivity of abstinence-only harms followers as they are not able to receive as much knowledge as possible.  Leaders of the ABC method have highlighted the use of abstinence as a tool among others.  The mutual exclusivity that so many abstinence-only teachers espouse does not need to exist.&lt;ref name="van1988"/&gt;  Abstinence can be an aspect of sex education without being the only curriculum in order to support an educated platform against HIV/AIDS infection in [[Uganda]].

The '''African Writers' Evening''' is the first regular evening held for African writers at the UK's Poetry Café. It was started in 2003 by [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]] in consultation with the directors of the [[Poetry Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2|title=African Writers Evening &amp;raquo; About|accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926110840/http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2| archivedate= 26 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he completed a residency there. The solid reputation of African Writers' Evening is based on its ability to consistently identify and feature talented emerging writers.

Diana Evans and [[Hisham Matar]], for example, were both featured prior to the official releases of their début publications, two of 2007′s features Ken Kamoche and [[Sade Adeniran]] were shortlisted for the 2008 [[Commonwealth Prize]] for their first books, and [[Inua Ellams]] won an [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] First Award three years after his first featured appearance at African Writers' Evening in 2006. Recently, the event's founder Nii Ayikwei Parkes was himself shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize and the November 2009 featured reader, [[Nadifa Mohamed]] won the 2010 [[Betty Trask Award]].

African Writers' Evening is held bi-monthly from March to November with occasional special events, such as the AWE Heritage Series launched at the [[Southbank Centre]] on 6 July 2009 and AWE/NYC, which was held at the Bowery Club in September 2009. While the event is still held mainly at the Poetry Café in [[Covent Garden]], a recent partnership with the [[Southbank Centre]] has seen the end-of-year reading in November held at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] since 2008.

==Policy==
African Writers' Evening features writers of all genres and defines "African" based on lived experience rather than simplistic notions of heritage. Featured writers have included white writers like [[Robyn Scott]], [[Isobel Dixon]] and [[Gillian Slovo]], as well as Africans of Indian origin such as Sharmila Chauhan.

==First event==
The first African Writers' Evening was held in July 2003 at the Poetry Café and featured Nii Ayikwei Parkes (who was writer-in-residence at the venue), [[Jessica Horn]], a Ugandan poet, and Abby Ajayi, a Nigerian-British short story and script writer. The event in its current format started in July 2004. Its tagline is: ''Where Africa speaks and the world listens''.

==History and expansion==
African Writers' Evening initially paid writers travel expenses and they read for free as a way of supporting the reading series. However, in September 2005, the series received funding from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]] and began to pay the featured writers an appearance fee. This development allowed the series to begin flying writers in from abroad to share their work: [[Helon Habila]]'s appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in 2009 was part of this trend.

Since the New York event held in September 2009, African Writers' Evening appears to be on a path of expansion and collaboration. In April 2010, they held an event in Birmingham in collaboration with The Drum Theatre, the [[British Council]] and London Book Festival and in July 2010 a book sale event, named the African Book Market was held at the Poetry Café in partnership with major publishers, such as [[Random House]], as well as smaller outfits like [[Serpent's Tail]]. They also announced a book discussion initiative starting in September 2010.

==Organisation==
The event is run by a London-based collective called London Society, Literature, Arts and Music Central, abbreviated as London SLAM Central.

'''Agritourism''' or '''agrotourism''', as it is defined most broadly, involves any [[Agriculture|agriculturally]] based operation or activity that brings visitors to a [[farm]] or [[ranch]]. Agritourism has different definitions in different parts of the world, and sometimes refers specifically to [[farm stay]]s, as in Italy. Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a [[corn maze]], slopping hogs, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) on a farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Emily|last= Biuso|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Down on the Farm With Your Sleeves Rolled Up  |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/23/travel/escapes/23agritourism.html?sq=agritourism&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=

Though most agritourists simply spend an afternoon visiting farm stands, picking fruit, or feeding animals, others might stay on a farm for several days. Depending on the farm, they might have the opportunity to help with farm or ranch chores, contributing to tasks ranging from planting crops to building greenhouses. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agritourism is a form of niche tourism that is considered a growth industry in many parts of the world, including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Hollow Log Country Retreat |url=http://agritourismaustralia.com.au/ |title=Accommodation, Tours, Farmstay, B&amp;B Options in Regional Australia |publisher=Agritourism Australia |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410050443/http://agritourismaustralia.com.au/ |archive-date=2012-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref name="Manitoba Agritourism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunities for Diversifying our Farms|url=http://mbagritourism.wordpress.com/|work=Growing Forward and Manitoba Agriculture Food and Rural Initiatives|publisher=Manitoba Agritourism|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref name="farmstays.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Nowak |url=http://farmstays.blogspot.com/ |title=The Farm Stay Project |publisher=Farmstays.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesvarrdec |url=http://wesvarrdec.blogspot.com/2010/02/agri-tourism-boom-seen-in-2009.html# |title=Leading innovations in R&amp;D for 2011-2016: Negros agri-tourism booms in 2009 |publisher=Wesvarrdec.blogspot.com |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms associated with agritourism are "agritainment", "value added products", "farm direct marketing" and "sustainable agriculture".

== Public awareness ==
People have become more interested in how their food is produced. They want to meet farmers and processors and talk with them about what goes into [[food production]].&lt;ref name="USDA" /&gt; For many people who visit farms, especially children, the visit marks the first time they see the source of their food, be it a [[Dairy cattle|dairy cow]], an ear of [[Maize|corn]] growing in a field, or an [[apple]] they can pick right off a tree.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/knowyourfarmer?navid=KNOWYOURFARMER|publisher=USDA|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers and ranchers use this interest to develop traffic at their farm or ranch, and interest in the quality of their products, as well as awareness of their products.&lt;ref name="Meadowlark Herald, Vol. 3 Iss. 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadowlarkherald.blogspot.com |last=Brachfeld |first=Aaron |title=USDA February 2012 Agrotourism to cultivate new direct sales |publisher= The Meadowlark Herald {{pipe}} Volume 3 Issue 8 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
While revenue and education are often primary drivers for farmers to diversify and invite guests onto their property, safety isn't always a top priority. Accidents involving tractors, wagon rides, trips, falls, and traffic occur at agritourism operations on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ag Injury News Clippings|url = http://www.AgInjuryNews.org|website = www.aginjurynews.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and specific cases of agrotourism-related injuries are tracked and stored by researchers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weichelt|first=Bryan|last2=Gorucu|first2=Serap|date=2018-02-17|title=Supplemental surveillance: a review of 2015 and 2016 agricultural injury data from news reports on AgInjuryNews.org|url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2018/02/16/injuryprev-2017-042671|journal=Injury Prevention|language=en|pages=injuryprev–2017–042671|doi=10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042671|issn=1353-8047|pmid=29386372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this data is available at publicly accessible sites such as AgInjuryNews.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aginjurynews.org|title=Ag Injury News Clippings|website=www.aginjurynews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agritourism by country ==

=== Latvia ===
Agrotourism in [[Latvia]] is a popular international tourist destination with many farming tours available such as grain, vegetable, fruit, dairy, and livestock. The farms display the lifestyles and work of active farmers, farming processes, farm products, and the opportunities and positive aspects of a life in the countryside. Tourists can learn how food is made from the field to the final product whilst also engaging in harvesting if possible. Some tours focus on traditional local [[Latvian cuisine]] such as [[cottage cheese]], [[buckwheat]], [[seaberry]] buckthorn, [[caraway]] cheese, dark [[rye bread]] and cured meats. Brewing beer is also widely popular with plenty of breweries producing a wide array of beer types. In addition, farms are gaining popularity that promote and teaches the way Latvian's traditionally used to live and farm their produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=saeima|first1=Zemnieku|title=Agricultural Tourism Farms|url=http://agro.zemniekusaeima.lv/en/c/wrth/agro|website=agro.zemniekusaeima.lv|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
The country-hotel scene has come on apace since 1960, when the [[Michelin Guide|Michelin guide]] to Italy listed not a single establishment in the Chianti area. But even after the boom in rural accommodation in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the choice was still limited, by and large, to basic agroturismo farm-holiday places or rather stuffy country-house hotels. The past few years have seen the arrival of a handful of stylish luxury spa resorts, and some mid-range options where guests benefit from a hands-on, personal approach.

Since 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law,&lt;ref&gt;Law N. 730, year 1985&lt;/ref&gt; emended in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Law N. 96, year 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The law states basic requirements to claim the title of "agriturismo", and delegates single regions to further regulate the matter.

Italian agritourism attract visitors from all around the globe. In particular, given the luxury nature of rural tourism, international flows are demand-driven.

=== India ===
Since 2004 Agriculture Tourism is operational, it started in Baramati Agri Tourism Center under the guidance of Pandurang Taware.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He received the National Tourism Award from the President Of India, for the most innovative Tourism Product. Agri Tourism India (ATDC) is pioneer in the development and marketing of agri tourism concept in India. ATDC, as of 2014, has 218 affiliated farmers and operates agri tourism center in their respective villages in the state of Maharashtra.

=== Turkey ===

In the province of Hatay, The village of [[Vakifli]] has a small eco and cultural tourism industry, as it is often touted as the last rural village in Turkey where [[Armenians]] live. The small village has a guest house where visitors can buy organic products and see the life of the village. There is potential for ecotourism in the Aegean area of Western Turkey as well, and is a growing industry there.

Agritourism is widespread in the United States.&lt;ref name="ruralbounty.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralbounty.com/ |title=Find a farm, orchard, ranch, winery, csa, &amp; family fun |publisher=Rural Bounty |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agritourists can choose from a wide range of activities that include [[fruit picking|picking fruits]] and [[vegetable]]s, riding [[horse]]s, tasting [[honey]], learning about [[wine]] and [[cheese]]making, or shopping in farm gift shops and farm stands for local and regional [[produce]] or hand-crafted [[gift]]s.

According to the USDA [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service]], "Tourism is becoming increasingly important to the U.S. economy. A conservative estimate from the [[Federal Reserve Board]] in [[Kansas]], based on 2000 data, shows that basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.6 percent of all U.S. employment. Even more telling, data from the Travel Industry Association of America indicate that 1 out of every 18 people in the U.S. has a job directly resulting from travel expenditures".&lt;ref name="csrees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/economics/in_focus/small_business_if_tourism.html |title=Rural Tourism February 2008 |publisher=USDA Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service |accessdate= December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frbk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/Pdf/3q03wilk.pdf |format=PDF |last=Wilkerson |first=Chad |year=2003 |title=Travel and Tourism: An Overlooked Industry in the U.S. and Tenth District Economic Review, Third Quarter 2003 Federal Reserve Board in Kansas |publisher=Kc.frb.org |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Research: Economic Impact of Travel and Tourism" (2004).

Through the Small Farm Center at the [[University of California]], "Agricultural tourism or agritourism, is one alternative for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. Some forms of agritourism enterprises are well developed in [[California]], including fairs and festivals. Other possibilities still offer potential for development".&lt;ref name="asfc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/agritourism/ |title=Agritourism Davis, California: University of California, Small Farm Center |date=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UC Small Farm Center has developed a California Agritourism Database that "provides visitors and potential entrepreneurs with information about existing agritourism locations throughout the state".&lt;ref name="cad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calagtour.org/AgTour.ASP |title=California Agritourism Database Davis, California: University of California, Small Farm Center |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115161716/http://www.calagtour.org/AgTour.ASP |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication ''Promoting Tourism in Rural America'' explains the need for planning and marketing a rural community and weighing the pros and cons of tourism. According to the publication, local citizen participation is helpful and should be included in starting any kind of a tourism program.

'''Gil Alberto Enríquez Gallo''' (24 July 1894 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1962) was [[List of heads of state of Ecuador|President]] of [[Ecuador]] 1937&amp;ndash;1938.

Enriquez was appointed as a general in the Ecuadorian army by [[Federico Páez]], and served as Minister of Defense in his government. In September 1937, he overthrew Páez in a military coup.  Although he ruled for less than a year, Enríquez achieved note as a social reformer by his promulgation of the Labor Code of 1938.

Enríquez is also remembered for having initiated a protracted confrontation with the United States-based South American Development Company over the terms of its Ecuadorian concession and the wages it paid its Ecuadorian employees.  The company refused to comply with Enríquez's entreaty that more of the profits from its mining operations stay in Ecuador, and it won the support of the United States Department of State.

'''Annette Susannah Beveridge (née Akroyd)''' (1842–1929) was a British [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] known for her translation of the ''[[Humayun|Humayun-nama]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Begam Gulbadam|author2=Annette S. Beveridge|title=The history of Humayun = Humayun-nama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|publisher=Begam Gulbadam|pages=249–|id=GGKEY:NDSD0TGDPA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Babur-nama]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=53954|title=Beveridge [née Akroyd], Annette Susannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Annette Akroyd's father William Akroyd was a [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian]] industrialist associated with the establishment of the [[Bedford College, London]] in 1849, where she completed her study in 1863.&lt;ref name="Kopf1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopf|first=David|authorlink=David Kopf|title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1979|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=978-0-691-03125-5|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in India==
[[File:Annette Akroyd.jpg|thumb|Annette Akroyd with the students of Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, 1875.]]
In October 1872 she sailed for [[British India]]. Around 1875 she was involved in a public controversy with [[Keshub Chandra Sen]], an Indian philosopher and social reformer who attempted to incorporate Christian theology within the framework of Hindu thought. Akroyd was shocked by her discussions with him and felt that Sen, who spoke up for women's education in England, was a typical Hindu obscurantist back home in India, trying to keep knowledge from the minds of women.&lt;ref&gt;David Kopf pg. 34-40&lt;/ref&gt; This dispute spilled into the native press and had its impact on the [[Bethune College|Bethune School]]. Akroyd was also dismayed with Sen's associates such as [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]], [[Aghore Nath Gupta]] and [[Gour Govinda Ray]], who were traditionally Hindu in educational background and resisted the education of women.

:"Mr. Sen had a strong prejudice against university education, in fact, against what is generally regarded as high education, of women. He objected to teaching them, for instance, such subjects as Mathematics, Philosophy and Science, whereas the advanced party positively wanted to give their daughters and sisters what is generally regarded as high education. They did not object to their university education and were not disposed to make much difference in point of education between men and women. There was no hope of compromise between two such extreme schools of thought, Accordingly, the radical party proceeded to start a separate female school of their own, called the [[Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya]] for the education of the adult young ladies belonging to their party. The successful manner in which they carried on the work of this school under Miss Akroyd, subsequently Mrs. Beveridge, attracted much public notice and was highly praised by the officers of Government. This school did excellent work for many years and was subsequently conducted under the name of the [[Banga Mahila Vidyalaya]] and was at last amalgamated with the [[Bethune College]] for ladies, to which it furnished some of its most distinguished students."&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Brahmo Samaj" Sastri:1911:p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
Annette Beveridge translated the diaries of the first [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]], the [[Baburnama]], publishing it in four books from 1912 to 1922. She used both Persian and Turki sources.&lt;ref name="Beveridge3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume I|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli01babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume II|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli02babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also translated the biography of the second [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]], [[Humayun]], from Persian into English. The memoir had been written by his sister [[Gulbadan Begum]], whom Beveridge affectionately called "Princess Rosebud".&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Annette Susannah|title=Life and writings of Gulbadan Begam (Lady Rosebody)|date=1898|location=Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewritingsofgu00beve|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begam|first1=Gulbaden|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The history of Humāyūn (Humāyūn-nāma)|date=1902|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhumynhum00bevegoog|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other translated works include ''The key of the hearts of beginners'', 1908.

==Marriage and children==
She married [[Henry Beveridge]] of the [[Indian Civil Service]].&lt;ref name="MacMillan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret MacMillan|title=Women of the Raj: The Mothers, Wives, and Daughters of the Bristish Empire in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xh4m4Ljrn4C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-8129-7639-7|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had two children: a daughter, Annette Jeanie Beveridge (d. 1956), who married [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 "Courtship and marriage", of ''The Life of R. H. Tawney: Socialism and History''  By Lawrence Goldman&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, [[William Beveridge]] (1879–1963), a noted economist who gave his name to [[Beveridge report|the report]] associated with the foundation of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=pe/&gt;

The Beveridges lived at Pitfold, [[Shottermill]], [[Surrey]], England.&lt;ref name=pe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p14226.htm#i142259|title=Henry Beveridge  Genealogy|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Artificial empathy''' ('''AE''') is the development of AI systems − such as companion robots − that are able to detect and respond to human [[emotion]]s. According to scientists, although the technology can be perceived as scary or threatening by many people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Jan-Philipp Stein|author2=Peter Ohler|date=2017|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716303055|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=160|pages=43–50|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it could also have a significant advantage over humans in professions which are traditionally involved in emotional role-playing such as the health care sector.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Emotions Matter in the Ethics of Human-Robot Interaction? |work=Artificial Empathy and Companion Robots |author=Bert Baumgaertner |author2=Astrid Weiss |publisher=European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 288146 (“HOBBIT”); and the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) under grant agreement T623-N23 (“V4HRC”) |url=http://doc.gold.ac.uk/aisb50/AISB50-S19/AISB50-S19-Baumgaertner-paper.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the care-giver perspective for instance, performing emotional labor above and beyond the requirements of paid labor often results in chronic stress or burnout, and the development of a feeling of being desensitized to patients. However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of research ==
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}
There are a variety of philosophical, theoretical, and applicative questions related to AE. For example:
# Which conditions would have to be met for a robot to respond competently to a human emotion?
# What models of empathy can or should be applied to Social and Assistive Robotics?
# Does the interaction of humans with robots have to imitate affective interaction between humans?
# Can a robot help science learn about affective development of humans?
# Would robots create unforeseen categories of inauthentic relations?
# What relations with robots can be considered truly authentic? &lt;ref name="Damiano"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Artificial Empathy: An Interdisciplinary Investigation |publisher=IJSR |work=Special issue |author=Luisa Damiano |author2=Paul Dumouchel |author3=Hagen Lehmann |url=http://www00.unibg.it/dati/persone/1931/7067-IJSR_Special_Issue_Damiano_et_al.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">'''Civil inattention''' is the process whereby strangers who are in close proximity demonstrate that they are aware of one another, without imposing on each other – a recognition of the claims of others to a public space, and of their own [[personal boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Finkelstein, ''The Art of Self-Invention'' (2007) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Civil inattention is the term introduced by [[Erving Goffman]] to describe the care taken to maintain public order among strangers and thus to make anonymised life in cities possible.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than either ignoring or staring at others, civil inattention involves the unobtrusive and peaceful scanning of others so as to allow for neutral interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Baldwin, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'' (2004) p. 396 and 276&lt;/ref&gt; Through brief [[eye contact]] with an approaching stranger, we both acknowledge their presence and foreclose the possibility of more personal contact or of  [[conversation]].

Civil inattention is thus a means of making [[privacy]] possible within a crowd through culturally accepted forms of self-distancing.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Finkelstein, ''The Art of Self-Invention'' (2007) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Seemingly (though not in reality) effortless,&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; such civility is a way of shielding others from personal claims in public&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sennett, ''The Fall of Public Man'' (1976) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; – an essential feature of the abstract, impersonal relationships demanded by the [[open society]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The Open Society and its Enemies Vol 1'' (1995) p. 174-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative aspects==
Civil inattention can lead to feelings of [[loneliness]] or [[invisibility]], and it reduces the tendency to feel responsibility for the well-being of others. Newcomers to [[urban area]]s are often struck by the impersonality of such routines, which they may see as callous and uncaring, rather than as necessary for the peaceful co-existence of close-packed millions.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Moretti, ''Modern Epic'' (1996) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffman noted that "when men and women cross each other's path at close quarters, the male will exercise the right to look for a second or two at the female ... Civil inattention, then, can here involve a degree of role differentiation regarding obligations".&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p.  249&lt;/ref&gt; Such a public [[double standard]] has been challenged by [[feminists]], who resent the expectation that female appearance/behavior may be routinely commented on.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron, ''Feminism and Linguistic Theory'' (1992) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior may then escalate into staring, [[stalking]] and insulting harassment, revealing the costs a breach of civil inattention may bring.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Baldwin, ''Introducing Cultural Studies'' (2004) p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insanity of place===
Goffman saw many classic indications of madness as violations of the norm of civil inattention speaking to strangers, or shying away from every passing glance.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=March 2016}}

'''Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop''' (1847 – September 11, 1892) was an American social reformer and autobiographer.{{sfn|Davis|1989|p=151}} Her prominence came from her remarkable experience, being confined and unlawfully imprisoned in the [[Utica Lunatic Asylum]] for 26 months (October 1880 – December 1882),{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} through a plot of a secret enemy to kill her. She eventually managed to communicate with [[James Bailey Silkman]], a lawyer who, like herself, was confined in the same asylum under similar circumstances. He succeeded in obtaining a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Judge [[George G. Barnard]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] pronounced Lathrop sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

After that time, she devoted her life to ameliorating the laws relating to lunacy.{{sfn|American Woman Suffrage Association|1892|p=170}} Lathrop felt she owed it to women to take her case before the [[New York State Legislature]], and demand reform in this direction, but she was unsuccessful in two efforts and found herself penniless and facing the need to support herself. After several efforts, she became a [[court stenographer]], and ten years after her release, wrote a book, the story of her own institutionalization, entitled ''[[A Secret Institution]].'' Published at her own expense,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; this book led to the formation of the Lunacy Law Reform League, in 1889, a national organization with headquarters in [[New York City]], of which Lathrop became the secretary and was the national organizer.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

==Early years and education==
Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. She was a daughter of Gen. William E. Lathrop, a Brigadier General of the National Guard. Lathrop’s father had met and married Lathrop’s mother, Jemima, at the age of 42 – Jemima was only 19.  Lathrop had been one of five children, but had lost her eldest brother to disease in 1865 and her second eldest brother moved to the southern part of the country to look for work.  Lathrop’s father passed away in 1877 leaving his wife, and his three daughters to open their home to board strangers for income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from the Rochester Academy.

Lathrop also often traveled significant distances and visited friends around Rochester.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Teacher===
Lathrop became a teacher, which, owing to her father's failure in business, became a means of support to her family as well as to herself. She continued to teach successfully until her unlawful imprisonment in the Utica State Hospital (formerly known as the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nysasylum.com/utica/ushhist.htm|title=Utica State Hospital|website=nysasylum.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utica Lunatic Asylum incarceration and release===
Lathrop feared that Miss Hamlo, a boarder in her mother's house, was poisoning her. Lathrop was obsessed with a Mr. Zell, a former lover who married another woman after Lathrop rejected him. After repenting her decision to reject Zell, Lathrop became convinced that Hamlo was in alliance with Zell's wife. After Lathrop began seeing Zell eveywhere, she believed he had divorced, and would now marry her if Lathrop survived Hamlo's poisonings.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} When Lathrop's life was saved on two occasions by friends, she took some of the [[Aconitine|aconite]]-poisoned tea to a chemist for analysis, as she sought reliable proof before making open charges against any one. At the instigation of a doctor who was in sympathy with the plot to incarcerate Lathrop, she went to Utica to consult Dr. [[John P. Gray (psychiatrist)|John P. Gray]], Superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in [[Utica, New York]]. Instead of seeing Grey, upon her arrival, she was incarcerated with the insane, without the commitment papers required by law, and kept a prisoner at the asylum for 26 months.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

She was sent to the asylum at the insistence of her mother and sisters, who lived in Rochester, and who asserted that Lathrop was suffering from the delusion that somebody was trying to poison her. Her answer was that it was not a delusion, that somebody was endeavoring to poison her. But she was willing to accept proof to the contrary, which was also evidence that there was no delusion. Nonetheless, her incarceration ensued.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;  By the time Lathrop was admitted to the asylum, she was 32 years old and unmarried despite engagements to two different men.  Her first engagement was broken off by her fiancé due to cold feet and her second betrothed died from consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hospital, according to Lathrop was “a living tomb.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few weeks of her arrival at Utica, Lathrop had written letters to two of her physician friends only to find out later that her letters had never been mailed.  The attending physician claimed they were not sent because the asylum was not obliged to send her letters “all over the country.”  Lathrop was “amazed and dumbfounded” at the idea that not only would her letters be read by the asylum doctors, but that they would never reach their intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop had easily made a friend who had revealed to her how she would be able to communicate to the outside world without getting caught by the authorities. She obtained paper through another patient who had hidden the contraband in her room. The woman would not out rightly give the paper to Lathrop for fear of punishment for aiding and abetting, but hinted that there was nothing she could do if Lathrop took a page or two while she was elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop also wrote on newspaper edges and scraps of wrapping paper which she also hid in her skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she managed to communicate with Silkman, a New York lawyer, who had been forcibly carried off and imprisoned in the same insane asylum. He obtained a writ of ''habeas corpus'' at once on behalf of Lathrop, and in December, 1882, Judge Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop to be sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

===Social reformer and autobiographer===
Immediately upon her release, Lathrop went before the New York State Legislature. She described her experience and the necessity for reform. After making another fruitless effort the succeeding year, she found herself homeless and penniless, and dependent upon a cousin's generosity for shelter and support, forced to begin her new life under the most difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}[[File:A Secret Institution (1890).png|thumb|''A Secret Institution'' (1890)]]
Lathrop collected money for a charitable society on a commission, spending her evenings studying stenography and typewriting. She soon started a business of her own and was successful as a [[court stenographer]]. Ten years after her release, she wrote her book, ''A Secret Institution'', which was a history of her own life, written in the style of a novel, and descriptive of what she experienced or witnessed while an inmate of the Utica asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life|last=Willard|first=Frances Elizabeth|last2=Livermore|first2=Mary Ashton Rice|date=1893|publisher=Moulton|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping true to her vow “to devote the rest of [her] life to the cause of the insane,” Lathrop formed the Lunacy Law Reform and the Anti-Kidnapping Leagues.  The Leagues provided legal services to asylum patients who felt they were victims of a corrupt legal system. The goal of the leagues was to “protect sane people from false imprisonment.”  Both groups had helped several individuals who had been unjustly incarcerated secure their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1892|work=The New York Times Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunacy Law Reform League in 1889, was a national organization having its headquarters in [[New York City]], of which she was secretary and national organizer.
{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=451}} Lathrop spoke out against asylum abuses, and became a spokesperson for others incarcerated as insane.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=67}} She lived with self-doubt, fear, and suspicion, while trying to understand how incarceration affected her. She struggled with society's perceptions of her mental stability.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=68}}

Lathrop died in [[Saratoga, New York]], on September 11, 1892,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}} and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester.

==Legal case==
Albert Bach, legal counsel to Lathrop, held that the interesting point in the case was the question of the deprivation of Lathrop's postal rights while in the asylum. She was not permitted to have writing materials, and even though she succeeded in obtaining them, the asylum authorities disposed of her letters as they pleased. The claim was asserted that asylum managers have no such control over inmates as have prison managers; that the former institutions have more of the character of hospitals. Bach found nothing in the by-laws of the Utica asylum giving the right to this close supervision. He said that there were many instances of wrongful incarceration, and that justice would seem to dictate that inmates of asylums should have access to the mails. Even though much of it would be trash, it would be well worth while to endure that if information could be obtained to the release of a person improperly detained.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will sue the aslym; Miss Lathrop alleges that she was wrongfully incarcerated.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/12/20/103287284.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1890|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports suggested that Lathrop would bring a suit of U$25,000 damages against the management of the Utica State Insane Asylum. The grounds alleged were the wrongful detention of herself, and the seizure of her letters written to friends asking them to help her to regain her liberty. Lathrop’s lawyer gave the following statement of the scope of the lawsuit: &lt;blockquote&gt;Of course the main point is in regard to the interception of letters that she wrote to friends asking for assistance. If the managers of the asylums have the right to intercept letters, they have the power to shut a person entirely from the world, whether the person be insane or not. This is a difference between a criminal and a lunatic. In the case of a criminal he is in his position through his own fault, but the insane person is a patient, and deserves all possible consideration. If they stop a person’s letters, they virtually remove from that person the possibility of obtaining release. The suit is brought not so much for the sake of damages, as to test the point whether or not the managers of asylums have a right to enforce such a rule. I have become interested in the matter, and intend to follow it up and test the question thoroughly. One of the things I will do will be to write to the Postmaster General, asking if it would not be advisable in case we can prove that the authorities are wrong in prohibiting the forwarding of letters, to place free delivery boxes in all asylums, that the patients may have a chance to correspond without difficulty with their friends. I believe such a system would do away with much of the abuse that without doubt exists in many asylums, and would greatly lessen the chance of sane persons being held in confinement.{{sfn|Jerdone|1891|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Collaborative E-democracy2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a collaborative e-democracy every citizen participates in the policy process, either indirectly, by delegating proxy representatives to vote on their behalf within the different policy domains, or directly, by voting on a particular issue (green arrows).]]

'''Collaborative e-democracy''' or '''super-democracy''' is a democratic conception that combines key features of [[direct democracy]], [[representative democracy]], and [[e-democracy]] (i.e. the use of [[Information and communication technology|ICTs]] for democratic processes). The concept was first published at two international academic conferences in 2009 (see below).

Collaborative e-democracy refers to a [[political system]] in which governmental stakeholders ([[politicians]]/[[political party|parties]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] etc.) and non-governmental stakeholders ([[NGO]]s, [[lobbying|political lobbies]], local communities, individual [[citizens]], etc.) collaborate on the development of public [[law]]s and [[policy|policies]]. This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental [[social networking site]] in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making).

While directly elected [[government officials]] (i.e. [[Liquid democracy#Delegated voting|‘proxy representatives’]]) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final [[voting]] power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable ([[initiative]]). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.

==Theoretical background==
Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components:
* '''‘Collaborative democracy’''', a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collaborative-democracy.com/cdDefinition.cfm www.collaborative-democracy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/cdn/ Collaborative Democracy Network], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''‘Collaborative e-policymaking’''' (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase [[Policy#Policy cycle|policy process]] in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] &lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. ], JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/ Collaborative Policy], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian National University, ANU E Press; [http://epress.anu.edu.au/anzsog/collab_gov/mobile_devices/index.html Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia?]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Proxy voting]] and [[delegative democracy]]''': Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.&lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556176.1556222 "Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making."], [http://www.dgrc.org/ Digital Government Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy process==
Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws &amp; policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; [[domain expert]]s; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives).

* '''Suggestion &amp; ranking phase''': Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy [[crowdsourcing]]). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others.
* '''Evaluation phase''': For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts.
* '''Voting phase''': Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed.
* '''Revision phase''': A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved.
To be clear, CPM is automated as a [[Process (computing)|software process]] that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.

==Principles==
Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles:
* '''[[Self-government]]''', the ideal of direct democracy, and “''quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur''”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “''that which affects all people must be approved by all people''”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies ([[Corporatocracy]]).
* '''[[Open source governance]]''', a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open source]] and [[open content]] movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy.
* '''Aggregation''': One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad-hoc groups to address these issues.
* '''[[Collaboration]]''': Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other.
* '''[[Collective intelligence]]''': The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of [[Web 2.0]].
* '''Collective learning &amp; Adoption''': The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oreilly.com/catalog/web2report/chapter/web20_report_excerpt.pdf O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits &amp; limitations==
The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following '''benefits''':
* '''[[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] and accessibility''': The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet.
* '''[[Political efficacy]]''': Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the [[democratic deficit]].
* '''[[Deliberative democracy|Deliberation]]''': The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information &amp; communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation.
* '''Collective awareness''': Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation’s collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies.

On the contrary the concept has several '''limitations''':
* '''[[Constitution]]al limits''': Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective.
* '''[[Digital divide]]''': People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded.
* '''[[Majority rule]]''': Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy.
* '''[[Naive]]ty''':  Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options.  This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will.  However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem.  Increased education, [[critical thinking]] and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.

==Research &amp; development==
In 2009 the two conceptions, ''collaborative e-democracy'' and ''collaborative e-policy-making'', were  first published at two [[academic conference]]s on [[e-governance]] and [[e-democracy]]:
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making”''; the [http://dgo2009.pbworks.com/ 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: "Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data &amp; Government"] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]];
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”'';  [http://edem2009.ocg.at/ The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* A third publication appears in the [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government", Vol 2, No 1 (2010)].

Current research is conducted at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] where a [[Prototype#Computer programming.2Fcomputer science|prototype]] software for  collaborative e-policymaking is being developed. The software will be featured on an independent web 2.0 platform with open participation; the volunteer participants will be facilitated to collaboratively develop Australian public laws and policies by proceeding through the phases of the CPM process. The start of the trialling period is probably 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/klaus/ QUT Urban Informatics Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''source''' or '''sender''' is one of the basic concepts of [[communication]] and [[information processing]]. Sources  are objects which [[wikt:encode|encode]] [[message]] [[data]] and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]] the [[information]], via a [[channel (communications)|channel]], to one or more [[observation|observer]]s (or [[receiver (information theory)|receivers]]).

In the strictest sense of the word, particularly in [[information theory]], a ''source'' is a process that generates message data that one would like to communicate, or reproduce as exactly as possible elsewhere in space or time.  A source may be modelled as memoryless, [[ergodic]], [[Stationary process|stationary]], or [[stochastic]], in order of increasing generality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">The '''Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking''', or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information.  It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including [[Library and Information Science]] and [[Health Communication]].

The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D., &amp; Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection:  An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women &amp; Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., &amp; Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. 
Science Communication, 16, 274-303.&lt;/ref&gt; It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. &amp; Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies "antecedents" that explain why people become information seekers, "information carrier characteristic" that shape how they go about looking for information, and "information seeking actions" that reflect the nature of the search itself.

==Design==

[[File:Diagram of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking.jpg|thumb|right|The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking]]
The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are:  Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions.  The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information.  Those factors are:  Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs.  These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process.  The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities.  This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information.  A person’s understanding is developed through the information field.  The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field.  The final schema involves information seeking actions.  This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking.  There are three major dimensions:  the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Carrier Characteristics==

The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Information Seeking Actions==

There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search.  For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Stages in the CMIS==

A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”.  According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.

The first stage, ''Casual'', is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.
 
The second stage is ''Purposive-Placid''. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.

The third stage is ''Purposive-Clustered''. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or [[BRCA mutation|BRCA]] 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.

The fourth stage, ''Directed'', includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5257">'''Conflict avoidance''' is a method of reacting to conflict, which attempts to avoid directly confronting the issue at hand. Methods of doing this can include changing the subject, putting off a discussion until later, or simply not bringing up the subject of contention. Conflict prevention  can be used as a temporary measure to buy time or as permanent means of disposing of a matter. The latter may be indistinguishable from simple acquiescence to the other party, to the extent that the person avoiding the conflict subordinates their own wishes to the party with whom they have the conflict. However, conflict prevention  can also take the form of withdrawing from the relationship. Thus, avoidance scenarios can be either win-lose, lose-lose or possibly even win-win, if terminating the relationship is the best method of solving the problem.

The term "conflict avoidance" is sometimes used to describe [[conflict prevention]]. Bacal criticizes this use of terms by asking, {{cquote|Is there a difference between preventing contracting AIDS by the use of appropriate precautions, and avoiding or not seeking treatment if one has contracted it? Of course there is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.work911.com/conflict/carticles/conav.htm Is Conflict Prevention The Same As Conflict Avoidance?], Bacal.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Turner and Weed classify concealment as one of the three main types of responses to conflict, describing concealers as those who take no risk and so say nothing, concealing their views and feelings. Concealers are further divided into three types; namely:&lt;ref&gt;Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Feeling-swallowers who swallow their feelings. They smile even if the situation is causing them pain and distress. They behave thus because they consider the approval of other people important and feel that it would be dangerous to affront them by revealing their true feelings.
*Subject-changers who find the real issue too difficult to handle. They change the topic by finding something on which there can be some agreement with the conflicting party. According to Turner and Weed, this response style usually does not solve the problem; instead, it can create problems for the people who use this and for the organization in which such people are working.
*Avoiders who go out of their way to avoid conflicts.

==Controversy==
The [[Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument|Thomas-Kilmann grid]] views avoidance as a lose-lose proposition since it does not address the issue at hand. But other sources view avoidance as a useful means of disposing of  very minor, non-recurring conflicts whose resolution would expend excessive amounts of time or resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html Timor-Australia Friendship Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317131906/http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality psychology research==
Research in [[personality psychology]] has indicated that the personality trait of [[agreeableness]]--one of the [[Big Five personality traits|five identifiable dimensions of personality]]--correlates with proclivity toward conflict avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict avoidance in the workplace==
In the workplace, managers sometimes avoid directly dealing with [[Workplace conflict|conflict among co-workers]] by simply separating them. In workplaces and other situations where continued contact with a person cannot be severed, workers may eschew confrontation as being too risky or uncomfortable, opting instead to avoid directly dealing with the situation by venting to others or engaging in [[passive aggressive]] methods of attack such as [[gossip]]. Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, increased stress, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, and distrust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an East Bay Business Times article, some possible results of conflict-averse senior executives may include {{cquote|poor-performing executives can survive because the president doesn't investigate or act on employee complaints; conflict can become malignant between departments, because there is no tie breaker to force resolution; and ineffective managers are passed from one department to the next, because the senior executive would rather play 'pass the turkey' than cook the goose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastbay.bizjournals.com/extraedge/consultants/at_work/2003/06/16/column67.html?market=eastbay Confronting a leader's conflict avoidance], Joan Lloyd.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44913">'''E-services''' (electronic services) are services which use of [[Information and communication technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are- service provider, service receiver and the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service. Internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Rowley, J. (2006) An analysis of the e-service literature: towards a research agenda. Internet Research, 16 (3), 339-359&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government,&lt;ref&gt;Alasem, A. (2009). An Overview of e-Government Metadata Standards and Initiatives based on Dublin Core. Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7(1), 1 – 10&lt;/ref&gt; the term ‘[[E-Government]]’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, M., Codagnone, C. and Janssen, M. (2008) “Future of e-Government Research: 13 research themes identified in the eGovRTD2020 project’. Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, USA&lt;/ref&gt; E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lӧfstedt, U. (2005) ‘Assessment of current research and some proposals for future direction’, International Journal of Public IS&lt;/ref&gt;

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

"E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible." (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of E-service ==
Lu (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing [[Customer knowledge]]

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are

E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or [NGO|non-government organizations] (NGOs) (private sector).

E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side). The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix “public”: Public e-services. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of “e-Service” in both domains of e-government and [[e-business]].[example:[https://web.archive.org/web/20180125141728/http://eserviceforyou.com/] www.eserviceforyou.com]

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to – Data layer (data sources), processing layers (customer service systems, management systems, data warehouse systems, integrated customer content systems), exchange layer ([[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise Application Integration]]– EAI), interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring [[service quality]] and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The [[SERVQUAL]]- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The [[LIRNEasia]] study on benchmarking national telecom regulator websites focuses on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned here. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of [[information society]] reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by these agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==E-service cost factor==
Some major cost factors are (Lu, 2001):&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer

* Maintaining applications
* Internet connection
* Hardware/software
* Security concerns
* legal issues
* Training; and
* Rapid technology changes

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ndou, V.(2004)E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and Challenges, EJISDC 18, 1, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Aurigi, A. (1997) Virtual Cities, Social Polarisation, and the Crisis in Urban Public Space, Journal of Urban Technology, 4, 1, 19-52&lt;/ref&gt;

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A.B., Juillet, L., Paquet, G. and Roy, J. (2001) E-Governance and Government Online in Canada: Partnerships, People and Prospects, Government Information Quarterly,18, 93-104.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services in Bangladesh===
Bangladesh first e-service system is National E-Service System ([http://www.eservice.gov.bd/[ NESS]]) and 2nd e-Service For you [http://eserviceforyou.com/[eserviceforyou.com]]. 

===E-services in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent’s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Mawangi, W.(2006) The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: the case of Rwanda, Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research, May 21–24, 2006, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;van Brakel, P.A.(2009) Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications, Port Elizabeth, 2–4 September&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. &amp; Yen, D. C. 2006. e-Government: evolving relationship of citizens and government, domestic, and international development. Government Information Quarterly, 23(2): 207-235.)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the [http://www.gov.za/  Batho Pele portal], [[Sars efiling|SARS e-filing]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405043644/http://www.enatis.com/  e-Natis system], electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor ([http://www.mscmalaysia.my/  MSC]) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad ([http://www.tnb.com.my TNB]) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100529003757/http://www.tm.net.my/  TM]) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one’s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234322/http://www.elx.gov.my/  ELX])is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184753/http://www.mohr.gov.my/ MOHR]), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

[http://www.esyariah.gov.my/  e-Syariah] is the seventh project under the Electronic Government flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). A case management system that integrates the processes related to management of cases for the Syariah Courts.

== Examples of E-services in Established Countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. [[Government 2.0]] (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/a-citizens-guide-to-open-government-e-government-and-government-2-0/|title=A Citizen's Guide to Open Government, E-Government, and Government 2.0|last=Harper|first=Logan|date=June 10, 2013|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov|title=USA.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-commerce]] is another growing E-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. [[Amazon.com]] is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] develops and sells a wide variety of technological goods and services such as cell phones, music players, and computers. Apple’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/2016/03/08/americas-top-25-e-commerce-retailers-sales/|title=CEO Insiders: America's Top 25 E-commerce Retailers by Sales|last=Bhushan|first=Dr. Amarendra|date=March 8, 2016|website=CEOWorld Magazine|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-services allows businesses to reach new clientele and offer new services. Companies such as [[eBay]] and [[Etsy]] have achieved great success, with eBay posting a net income in 2016 of nearly $9 billion and Esty claiming roughly $200 million in profits from nearly $2 billion sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/27/how-e-commerce-helps-us-small-businesses-go-global.html|title=How e-commerce helps US small businesses go global|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 27, 2015|website=CNBC|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority or eBay's business is conducted in the United States but it does a great deal of international business including the United Kingdom and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2181/ebay/|title=eBay - Statistics &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global reach of Etsy is seen in nearly every country in the world with 31% of gross merchandise sales occurring outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amigobulls.com/articles/etsy-ipo-all-you-need-to-know-about-etsy|title=Etsy IPO: All You Need To Know About Etsy|last=Nagarkar|first=Vikram|date=March 19, 2015|website=Amigobulls|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-services in China ===
China’s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|title=China Gets the E-Gov Love Bug|last=Sharwood|first=Simon|date=September 15, 2016|website=The Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916031541/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China’s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “[[Internet Plus]].” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as [[Zhongguancun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2015-07/04/content_35980397.htm|title='Internet Plus' action plan unveiled|last=Xinhua|first=|date=July 4, 2015|website=China.org|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording)  This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased E-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/chinas-consumers-outspending-americans-and-british-online-2398441519.html|title=Chinese E-Commerce Boom — Bigger Than US, UK Combined|last=Vavra|first=Shannon|date=May 8, 2017|website=axios.com|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html?cid=PS_01_50_07_00_01_15_01&amp;mkwid=uui8CuV3|title=The Rise of China's New Consumer Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Goldman Sachs|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is China’s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion. Its services are globally available in Russia and Brazil through [[AliExpress]]. [[Tencent]] is another internet company with an annual revenue income of $16 billion. Tencent is used mainly for instant messaging but has other applications as well including mobile games and other digital content. By the end of 2015, Tencent’s [[WeChat]] messaging app reached around 700 million users. The biggest competitor for Tencent is Facebook’s [[WhatsApp]]. [[Baidu]] Is the most visited website in the country and it is used as a search engine and has an annual revenue of $10 billion. In March 2016, there were roughly 663 million users. [[Google]] challenges Baidu as the major internet search engines in the world. Huawei is a tech company that produces phones, tablets, and develops the equipment used in fixed-line networks. [[Huawei]] has an annual revenue income of $61 billion. It is currently located throughout 100 countries worldwide and in 2015, it filed 3,898 patent applications, more than any other country in the world. The biggest competitors to Huawei is Apple and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/technology/china-tech-behemoths/index.html|title=Meet China's Tech Behemoths|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|date=May 17, 2016|website=CNN|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Sheth., J.N., Sharma, A., (2007). E-Services: A framework for growth.  Journal of Value Chain Management, 1(1/2)&lt;/ref&gt; identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* [[Internet fraud|Fraud]] on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* [[Internet privacy|Privacy]] due the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, the access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. Possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is of privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations.  For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles.  Possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform.

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery ; one worth noting effort is Rowley’s study (2006)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Philip F. (2009). User Acceptance of Emergency Alert Technology: A Case Study. Proceedings of the 6th International ISCRAM Conference – Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.J. (2003). Usability of E-Government Web Sites for People with Disabilities, In Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03), IEEE Computer Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, P.T. Assessing Section 508 compliance on federal e-government Web sites: A multi-method, user-centered evaluation of accessibility for persons with disabilities. Government Information Quarterly 23 (2006) 169–190&lt;/ref&gt; who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site …Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Grönlund, Å., Hatakka, M. and Ask, A. (2007) ‘ Inclusion in the E-Service Society – Investigating Administrative Literacy Requirements for Using E-Services’. 6th International Conference (EGOV 2007, Regensburg, Germany), 4656&lt;/ref&gt; for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Bannister F. (2007). The curse of the benchmark: an assessment of the validity and value of e-government comparisons, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 73 (2), 171-188&lt;/ref&gt; “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
[[Digital divide]] is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, N; Gil-García, J ; Ferro, E (2009). Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature. Government Information Quarterly, 26(2009), 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites."

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or [[e-readiness]]. According to by Shalini (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Shalini, R. (2009). Are Mauritians ready for e-Government services?. Government Information Quarterly 26 (2009) 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; “the results of the research project reveal that a high [http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_2007_e_readiness_rankings&amp;rf=0|e-readiness index] may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question's priorities and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSINC International (2002). E-Readiness Guide. Available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/evaluation/e-readiness/geosinc01042002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”&lt;ref&gt;Codagnone, C.  Undheim T.A (2008).  Benchmarking eGovernment: tools, theory, and practice. European Journal of ePractice. Nº 4 • August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services.  According to the GAO report&lt;ref&gt;GAO.(2002). E-Government: Proposal addresses Critical Challenges. U.S General Accounting Office, Govt of the USA&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government.The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large,  Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, K, Melin, f, Lindgren, I, (2009) DEVELOPING PUBLIC E-SERVICES FOR SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS – A MULTIFACETED VIEW OF THE NEEDS FOR AN E-SERVICE. 17th European Conference on Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the [[stakeholder theory]] in public settings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, H. J. (2001). Applying stakeholder theory to e-government: Benefits and Limits. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C.,  Deshazo, R. &amp; Eck, D. V. (2001) "Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities". Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), 18(4), 293 - 307&lt;/ref&gt;

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=211245 Open Learning - OpenLearn - Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees' computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance.&lt;ref&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002). Strategic Management of Information systems and Technology in an e-World”, Proceedings of the 21st IT Conference, Sri Lanka, pp103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002b) “e-Governance in Asia Pacific”, Proceedings of the International Conference on Governance in Asia, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==E-service awards==
The benefits of e-services in advancing businesses efficiency and in promoting good governance are huge; recognizing the importance of these benefits has resulted in number of international awards that are dedicated to recognize the best designed e-services. In the section, we will provide description of some international awards

'''Frances Power Cobbe''' (4 December 1822 – 5 April 1904) was an Irish writer, social reformer, anti-[[vivisection]] activist, and leading [[women's suffrage]] campaigner. She founded a number of animal advocacy groups, including the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS) in 1875, and the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) in 1898, and was a member of the executive council of the London [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]].

She was the author of a number of books and essays, including ''The Intuitive Theory of Morals'' (1855), ''On the Pursuits of Women'' (1863), ''Cities of the Past'' (1864), ''Criminals, Idiots, Women and Minors'' (1869), ''Darwinism in Morals'' (1871), and ''Scientific Spirit of the Age'' (1888).

==Life==
[[File:Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Hajjin was Frances Power Cobbe's canine companion and traveled with her and her partner, Mary Lloyd, to Wales after Cobbe retired]]

Frances was a member of the prominent [[Cobbe family]], descended from Archbishop [[Charles Cobbe]], [[Primate of Ireland]]. She was born in [[Newbridge Estate|Newbridge House]] in the family estate in what is now [[Donabate]], Co. Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cobbe, Frances Power, with [[Blanche Atkinson]] |title=Life of Frances Power Cobbe as told by herself, |year=1904|location=London|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; co|page=74|url=https://archive.org/details/lifefrancespowe02atkigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe worked at the [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge Reformatory]] and lived with the owner, [[Mary Carpenter]], from 1858 to 1859, but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school and moved out.&lt;ref&gt;Saywell, R J, ''Mary Carpenter of Bristol'', The University of Bristol, 1964 (2001 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

Cobbe formed a relationship with the Welsh sculptor [[Mary Lloyd]] (1819-1896), whom she met in Rome in 1861 and lived with from 1864 until Lloyd's death. That death, in 1896, affected Cobbe badly. Her friend, the writer [[Blanche Atkinson,]] writing, “The sorrow of Miss Lloyd’s death changed the whole aspect of existence for Miss Cobbe. The joy of life had gone. It had been such a friendship as is rarely seen – perfect in love, sympathy, and mutual understand.” &lt;ref&gt; Shopland, Norena 'Frances and Mary' from ''Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales'' Seren Books (2017) &lt;/ref&gt; Around 1891 and in danger of losing their home at [[Hengwrt]], in which Lloyd had inherited a share on the death of her parents, the couple were relieved by a legacy of over £25,000 from the widow of [[Richard Vaughan Yates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=144, 335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are buried together at Saint Illtud Church Cemetery, [[Llanelltyd]], [[Gwynedd]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Sally|title=Frances Power Cobbe: Victorian Feminist, Journalist, Reformer|year=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|pages=139–147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAaC5cVOuuoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In letters and published writing, Cobbe referred to Lloyd alternately as "husband," wife," and "dear friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFRWylXaAtAC&amp;pg=PA51|title=Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England |first=Sharon |last=Marcus|publisher= |year= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobbe founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection (SPALV) in 1875, the world's first organisation campaigning against animal experiments, and in 1898 the BUAV, two groups that remain active. She was a member of the executive council of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and writer of editorial columns for London newspapers on [[suffrage]], property rights for women, and opposition to [[vivisection]]. Around 1880, with Louise Twining, she founded Homes for Workhouse Girls.&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, Eileen Janes (1992) Social motherhood and the sexual communion of labour in British Social Science, 1850-1950, ''[[Women's History Review]]'', 1:1, 63-87, DOI:

Cobbe met the Darwin family during 1868. [[Emma Darwin]] liked her, "Miss Cobbe was very agreeable." Frances persuaded [[Charles Darwin]] to read [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Metaphysics of Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Browne, Janet|title=Charles Darwin: The Power of Place|year=2002|publisher=Alfred A.

Cobbe's activism for women's rights included advocating for women to be allowed to take university examinations and therefore earn a degree at Oxford and Cambridge.

'''Francis Place''' (3 November 1771 in [[London]] – 1 January 1854 in London) was an [[England|English]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]].

==Early career and influence==
He was the illegitimate son of Simon Place and Mary Gray, and had a rough upbringing; his father ran a London [[sponging-house]] in Vinegar Yard, near [[Drury Lane]], and Place was born there. He was schooled to 1785 before being apprenticed to a leather-breeches maker in [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=22349|first=William|last=Thomas|title=Place, Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At eighteen Place was an independent journeyman, and in 1790 was married to Elizabeth Chad&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/visitkensingtonandchelsea/seedo/people/blueplaques/recordsp-s/francisplace.aspx|title=Francis Place|website=www.rbkc.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they moved to a house near the Strand. In 1793 he became involved in and eventually the leader of a strike of leather-breeches makers, and was refused work for several years by London's master tailors; he exploited this time by reading avidly and widely. In 1794, Place joined the [[London Corresponding Society]], a reform club, and for three years was prominent in its work, before resigning his post as chairman of the general committee in 1797 in protest at the violent tactics and rhetoric of some group members. In 1799 he became the partner in a tailor's shop, and a year later set up his own highly successful business at 16 Charing Cross.

==Energetic Radical==
[[File:Francis Place.jpg|thumb|200px|Francis Place portrait by [[Daniel Maclise]].]]
Withdrawing from politics whilst he established his business, he devoted three hours an evening after work to studying, eventually establishing such a large personal library in the back of his shop that it soon became a meeting place for radicals. In 1807 he supported [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet]], a Parliamentary candidate for Westminster, which allowed him to come into contact with such theorists as [[William Godwin]], [[James Mill]], [[Robert Owen]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Joseph Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. When Place retired in 1817 (with a steady stream of income from his shop, now run by his children), he lived for several months with Bentham and the Mills at [[Forde Abbey]].

It was around this time that he became involved in the movement for organised, public education, believing it to be a means of eradicating the ills of the working class. In the early 1820s he also became a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]], believing that as the population increased it would outstrip the food supply. He successfully associated [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]] with the idea of [[birth control]] (which Malthus himself had opposed despite his fears of overpopulation). Despite himself having fathered fifteen children, he advocated the use of contraception, although was not specific about in what forms. It was on this topic that he wrote his only published book, the influential and controversial ''Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population,'' in 1822.&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/CHplace.htm | title=Francis Place | work=Spartacus Educational | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stack98"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stack|first=David|title=Nature and Artifice|year=1998|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=0861932293|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest national birth control organization was founded in [[England]] in 1877 as a result of his thinking and activities.{{CN|date=November 2017}}  

Place also lobbied successfully for the 1824 [[repeal]] of the [[Combination Act]], which helped early [[Trade Unionism]], though new restrictions were soon introduced.  Oddly, Place himself regarded Trade Unionism as a delusion that workers would soon forget about if they were allowed to try it.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;
[[file:Louisa Chatterley as Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal by Rose Emma Drummond 1835.jpg|thumb|left|Louisa Chatterley in 1835]]
In 1827 he entered a long period of depression after the death of his wife from cancer. In February 1830 he married [[Louisa Chatterley]], a London actress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also in this year, Place helped support [[Rowland Detrosier]], a [[working class]] radical activist who also sought to distance himself from [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7559 Detrosier, Rowland (1800?–1834)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, accessed 10 Aug 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Through Place, Detrosier would be introduced to figures such as Bentham and J.S. Mill, who in turn introduced him to [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Detrosier's activities and writings would be influential amongst Manchester Radicals and the later [[Chartism|Chartists]]. He was also active in the agitation that led to the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], holding up the recent [[French Revolution of 1830|revolution in Paris]] as an example of what could happen if reform wasn't allowed by legal means.

== Moral-force Chartist and old age ==

Having lost much of his money in 1833 in bad investments, Place had to move from Charing Cross to [[Brompton Square]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and lost his regular contact with the Reformist middle-class. However, he remained politically active, working against the [[stamp tax]] and involving himself in the [[London Working Men's Association]], within which in 1838 he and [[William Lovett]] drafted the document that would become the [[Chartism|People's Charter]]. It then became evident that many Chartists were willing to use violent means, and when [[Feargus O'Connor]] replaced Lovett as the effective leader of the movement, Place ceased to be involved in Chartist activities.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt; On rescinding his involvement with the Chartists, he became involved in the movement to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].

For the next two decades he wrote his autobiography and organised the immense collection he had made: notes, pamphlets, newspapers and letters. In 1851 he separated from his wife and on 1 January 1854 died in the home of his two unmarried daughters in Hammersmith.

==Memorials==
[[File:Base of the Reformers Memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery, showing Lloyd Jones.JPG|thumb|220px|Base of the Reformers Memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery, showing Place's name]]
Place is listed on the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in [[London]].

==Legacy==
His pamphlets, letters, magazine and newspaper articles throw light on the social and economic history of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Thomas (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; His hoarding of documents create an important archive. The [[British Library]] currently holds these documents in fifty-four reels of micro-film as the [[Francis Place Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/microform/francisplace/index.html.

Men and women use [[social network service]]s (SNSs) differently and with different frequencies.  In general, several researchers have found that women tend to use SNSs more than men and for different and more social purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Historical connections==
Technologies, including communications technologies, have a long history of shaping and being shaped by the gender of their users. Although technologies used to perform housework have an apparent historical connection to gender in many cultures,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie_and_Wajcman&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald |last1=MacKenzie |first2=Judy |last2=Wajcman |title= The Social Shaping of Technology: How the Refrigerator Got its Hum |year=1985 |publisher=Open University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more ready connection to SNSs may be drawn with [[telephone]]s as a communications technology readily and widely available in the home. Telephone use has long had gendered connections ranging from the widespread assumption that women simply talk more than men, and the employment of women as [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. In particular, young women have been closely associated with extensive and trivial use of the telephone for purely social purposes.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940 |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.

There is historical and contemporary evidence that current fears about young girls' online safety have historical antecedents such as [[telegraph]]s and telephones. Further, in many cases those historical reactions resulted in restrictions of girls' use of technology to protect them from predators, molesters, and other criminals threatening their innocence. Like current fears focused on computer use, particularly SNSs and other communication media, these fears are most intense when the medium enters the home. These fears have the potential to – at least temporarily – overwhelm the positive and empowering uses of these technologies.&lt;ref name=Cassel_and_Cramer&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These historical fears are echoed in contemporary media accounts of youths' use of SNSs.

Finally, the histories of some SNSs themselves have ties with gender. For example, [[gay men]] were one of the earliest groups to join and use the early SNS [[Friendster]].&lt;ref name=boyd_and_Ellison&gt;{{cite journal |first1=danah |last1=boyd |first2=Nicole |last2=Ellison |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==

===Predilection for usage===
Many studies have found that women are more likely to use either specific SNSs such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross&gt;{{cite journal|author=Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. |year=2006 |title=Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook |journal=Privacy Enhancing Technologies |pages=36–58 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gx00n8nh88252822/ |doi=10.1007/11957454_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joinson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joinson, A.

The gap in gender differences has become less apparent in LinkedIn. In 2015 about 26 percent of online men and 25% of online women used the business-and employee-oriented networking site.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who have examined the gender of users of multiple SNSs have found contradictory results. Hargittai's groundbreaking 2007 study examining race, gender, and other differences between undergraduate college student users of SNSs found that women were not only more likely to have used SNSes than men but that they were also more likely to have used many different services, including Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster; these differences persisted in several models and analyses. Although she only surveyed students at one institution – the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] – Hargittai selected that institution intentionally as "an ideal location for studies of how different kinds of people use online sites and services."&lt;ref name=Hargittai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargittai, E. |year=2007 |title=Whose space? Differences among users and non-users of social network sites |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/hargittai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, data collected by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that men were more likely to have multiple SNS profiles. Although the sample sizes of the two surveys are comparable – 1,650 Internet users in the Pew survey&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; compared with 1,060 in Hargittai's survey&lt;ref name=Hargittai /&gt; – the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population.&lt;ref name=Pew_methodology&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Information |author=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200237/http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram attract more females. Picture sharing sites overall are very popular among women. Pinterest alone attracts three times as many female users than male. Although use of Pinterest by men has increased from 5% in 2012. Facebook attracts about 77% of women online. Instagram is also more likely to attract women. Men are more likely to participate in online forums like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot. One in five men claim to be a part of an online forum.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;

===Uses===

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt; Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., &amp; Smith, A. (2007). Teens and social media. Washington, DC: Pew Internet and American Life Project. Retrieved February 27, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-andSocial-Media.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study of [[blog]]s maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs.&lt;ref name=Jones_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Jones, S., Millermaier, S., Goya-Martinez, M., &amp; Schuler, J. |year=2008 |title=Whose space is MySpace? A content analysis of MySpace profiles |journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=9 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2202/2024 |doi=10.5210/fm.v13i9.2202}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Sweden|Swedish]] SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express [[heterosexual]] behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.&lt;ref name=Sveningsson&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Sveningsson Elm, M. |year=2007 |title=Gender stereotypes and young people's presentations of relationships in a Swedish Internet community |journal=YOUNG |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=145–167 |doi=10.1177/110330880701500203}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale study of gender differences in MySpace found that both men and women tended to have a majority of female Friends, and both men and women tended to have a majority of female "Top" Friends in the site.&lt;ref name=Thelwall1&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2008 |title= Social networks, gender and friending: An analysis of MySpace member profiles |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=1321–1330 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpace_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20835}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A later study found women to author disproportionately many (public) comments in MySpace,&lt;ref name=Thelwall2&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2009 |title= Homophily in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=219–231 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpaceHomophilypreprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20978}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but an investigation into the role of emotion in public MySpace comments found that women both give and receive stronger positive emotion.&lt;ref name=Thelwall3&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M., Wilkinson, D., Uppal, S. |year=2010 |title=Data mining emotion in social network communication: Gender differences in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–199 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DataMiningEmotionSNS_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.21180}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesised that women are simply more effective at using [[social networking sites]] because they are better able to harness positive emotion.

A study focused on the influence of gender and personality on individuals’ use of online social networking websites such as Facebook, reported that men use social networking sites with the intention of forming new relationships, whereas, women use them more for relationship maintenance. (Muscanell and Guadagno, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muscanell N.L., Guadagno R.E. | year = 2012 | title = Make new friends or keep the old: Gender and personality differences in social networking use | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 107–112 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to this, women are more likely to use Facebook or MySpace to compare themselves to others and also to search for information. Men, however, are more likely to look at other people's profiles with in the intention to find friends. (Haferkamp et al., 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haferkamp N., Eimler S.C., Papadakis A.M., Kruck J.V. | year = 2012 | title = Men are from Mars, women are from Venus?

===Privacy===

[[Internet privacy|Privacy]] has been the primary topic of many studies of SNS users, and many of these studies have found differences between male and female SNS users, although some studies have found results contradictory to those found in other studies.

Some researchers have found that women are more protective of their personal information and more likely to have private profiles.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Lewis, K., Kaufman, J., &amp; Christakis, N. |year=2008 |title=The taste for privacy: An analysis of college student privacy settings in an online social network |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that women are less likely to post some types of information. Acquisti and Gross found that women in their sample were less likely to reveal their [[sexual orientation]], personal address, or cell phone number.&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt; This is similar to Pew Internet &amp; American Life research of children users of SNSs that found that boys and girls presented different views of privacy and behaviors, with girls being more concerned about and restrictive of information such as city, town, last name, and cell phone number that could be used to locate them.&lt;ref name=Lenhart_and_Madden&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenhart, A., &amp; Madden, M. |year=2007 |title=Teens, privacy &amp; online social networks |publisher=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219174827/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that "identifies them directly – last name, cell phone number, and address or home phone number," linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about "[[cyberstalking]]", "[[cyberbullying]]", and security problems.&lt;ref name=Salaway_and_Caruso /&gt;

Despite these concerns about privacy, researchers have found that women are more likely to maintain up-to-date photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=Kolek&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Kolek, E. A., &amp; Saunders, D. |title=Online disclosure: An empirical examination of undergraduate Facebook profiles |journal=NASPA Journal |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1905}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strano&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Strano, M. M. |year=2008 |title=User descriptions and interpretations of self-presentation through Facebook profile images |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |volume=2 |issue=2 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110402&amp;article=(search%20in%20Issues)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kolek and Saunders found in their sample of college student Facebook users that women were more likely to not only post a photograph of themselves in their profile but that they were more likely to have a publicly viewable Facebook account (a contradictory finding compared to many other studies), post photos, and post photo albums.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt;

Women were more likely to have: (a) a publicly viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) a photo of themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, women were more likely to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt; Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study were more likely to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that there may also be a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.&lt;ref name=Strano /&gt;

Privacy has also been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send messages either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant gender differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Roesner, F., Gill, B. T., &amp; Kohno, T. (2014). Sex, Lies, Or kittens? investigating the use of snapchat’s self-destructing messages. In ''Financial Cryptography and Data Security - 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Revised Selected Papers.'' (Vol. 8437, pp. 64-76). (Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics); Vol. 8437). Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying'''

Past research carried out to investigate if there are any gender differences in cyber-bulling has found that boys commit more cyber verbal bullying, cyber forgery and more violence based on hidden identity or presenting themselves as other person. (Sincek 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Šincek, D., 2014, January. Gender differences in cyber-bullying. In International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ARTS SGEM2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
Although men and women users of SNSs exhibit different behavior and motivations, they share some similarities. For example, one study that examined the veracity of information shared on SNSs by college students found that men and women were as likely to "provide accurate and complete information about their birthday, schedule of classes, partner's name, AIM, or political views."&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt;

In contradiction to several of the studies described above that found that women are more likely to be SNS users, at least one very reputable study has found that men and women are equally likely to be SNS users. Data gathered in December 2008 by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] showed that the SNS users in their sample were equally divided among men and women.&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; As mentioned above, the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population&lt;ref name="Pew_methodology" /&gt; than the data in much of the previously described research.

==Traditional gender roles==
Some studies have found that traditional gender roles are present in SNSs, with men in this study conforming to traditional views of [[masculinity]] and the women to traditional views of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman /&gt; Qualitative work with college student SNS users by Martínez Alemán and Wartman&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Martínez Alemán |first1=A. M. |last2=Wartman |first2=K. L. |year=2009 |title=Online social networking on campus: Understanding what matters in student culture |publisher=Routledge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Managgo ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Manago, A. M., Graham, M. B., Greenfield, P. M., &amp; Salimkhan, G. |year=2008 |title=Self-presentation and gender on MySpace |journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology |volume=29 |pages=446–458 |doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001 |issue=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have found similar results for both Facebook and MySpace users. Moreover, the work by Managgo ''et al.'' discovered not only traditional gender roles and images but sexualisation of women users of MySpace.&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al /&gt; Similarly, research into the impact of comments in the profile of a Facebook users on that user's perceived attractiveness revealed a "sexual double standard", wherein negative statements resulted in male profile owners being judged more attractive and female profile owners less attractive.&lt;ref name=Walther_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x |author=Walther, J. B., Van Der Heide, B., Kim, S., Westerman, D., &amp; Tong, S.

&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at least one study has found that men and women SNS users both left textual clues about their gender.&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;

==Other gender identities in social networking==
In February 2014, Facebook announced the vast expansion of options for choosing gender identities to list on profiles, ranging to up to 56 gender identity choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apnewsbreak-gender-options-facebook-users-22501422|title=Technology and Science News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709|title=Timeline Photos - Facebook Diversity - Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Facebook followed up with allowing gender-neutral relationship identities for identifying family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/08/28/facebook-adds-gender-neutral-family-relationship-settings|title=Facebook Adds Gender-Neutral Family Relationship Settings|author=[[Parker Marie Molloy]]|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

The '''Hobbesian trap''' (or '''Schelling's dilemma''') is a theory that explains why [[preemptive strike]]s occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral ([[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], [[vicious circle]], [[Nash equilibrium]]) in which fear will lead to an [[arms race]] which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of [[game theory]]. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baliga|first=Sandeep|author2=Tomas Sjöström|title=The Hobbesian Trap|date=2010-09-21|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/baliga/htm/hobbesiantrap.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0143122012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory is most commonly associated with [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker TBS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0142003343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |title=The Gun Craze |last=Ocampo |first=Dan |date=December 16, 2012 |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419014702/http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_10_29_nytbookreview.html|title = All About Evil.

Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a [[preemptive strike]].&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

==Avoidance==
The Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström" /&gt; In the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], for example, [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Khrushchev]] realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

'''Human ecosystems''' are [[complex system|complex cybernetic systems]] that are increasingly being used by [[ecological]] [[anthropologists]] and other scholars to examine the ecological aspects of human communities in a way that integrates multiple factors as economics, socio-political organization, psychological factors, and physical factors related to the environment.

A human ecosystem has three central organizing concepts: human environed unit (an individual or group of individuals), environment, interactions and transactions between and within the components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sprout, H.H. and Sprout, M.: Ecological Perspective on Human Affairs (eBook and Paperback).|url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/2999.html|website = press.princeton.edu|access-date = 2016-01-28|date = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Total human ecosystem|total environment]] includes three conceptually distinct, but interrelated environments: the natural, human constructed, and human behavioral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">[[File:Ukposter.jpg|thumb|Poster in the Ukrainian language about the beginning of the indigenization policy ([[Korenizatsiya]] in Russian, meaning "indigenization", literally "putting down roots") in [[Soviet Ukraine]] (see: ''[[Ukrainization]]''). The text translates to: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army]] commanders, and the defense of Soviet Ukraine will be ensured." First published in the USSR in 1921.]]
'''Indigenization''' is the act of making something more native; transformation of some service, idea, etc. to suit a local culture, especially through the use of more indigenous people in [[Public administration|administration]], employment, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term is primarily used by [[anthropologist]]s to describe what happens when locals take something from the outside and make it their own (e.g. [[Africanization]], [[Americanization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenize|title=Definition of INDIGENIZE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In world politics, indigenization is the process in which non-Western cultures redefine their native land for better use in agriculture and [[mass marketing]]. Due to [[imperialism]] and the [[Motivation|impetus]] to [[Modernization theory|modernize]], many countries and cultures invoked Western values and ideals of [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] and [[independence]] in the past. But now, along with experiencing their own share of cultural confidence, they desire to revert to their traditional cultures and values.

However, the word indigenization is also used in almost the opposite sense, it means: to increase local participation in or ownership of, to indigenize foreign-owned companies, or to adapt (beliefs, customs, etc.) to local ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/indigenize|title=the definition of indigenize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the word ===
The word indigenization first appeared in a paper about studies conducted in India about [[Christian mission]]aries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/94473?redirectedFrom=indigenization+#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used to describe the process of making Churches indigenous in [[South India|southern India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=J. F|year=1951|title=The Indian Research Series|url=http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1951-00/1951-02-001-butler.pdf|journal=The Occasional Bulletin|volume=11|issue=2|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it spread to [[The Economist]] where it was used to describe managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named ''English Language in West Africa,'' where it was used to describe the adoption of English. Indigenization is often used to describe the adoption of [[colonialism|colonial]] culture in [[Africa]] because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== History of the use ===
Throughout history, the process of making something indigenous has taken different forms. Other words that describe similar processes of making something local are [[Africanization]], [[wikt:localization|Localization]], [[Glocalization]], and [[Americanization]]. However, these terms describe a specific case of the process of making something indigenous. These terms may be rejected in favor of the more general term of indigenization because the others may have too narrow of a scope. For example, [[Christianization]] was a form of indigenization by converting areas and groups to follow [[Christianity]].

== Types ==

=== Linguistics ===
In this context, indigenization is used to refer to how a language is adopted in a certain area such as [[African French|French in Africa]]. The term is used to describe the process of conveying a certain region’s culture and concepts in terms of the language that is being introduced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A common case where a language needed to be indigenized was in Africa where the ex-colonizer's language required some references to [[Religion in Africa|African religion]] and [[Culture of Africa|culture]], even though in the original language there was no vocabulary for this. As this process is being carried out, there is usually a [[metalanguage]] created that is some combination of the original language and the introduced language. This language shares cultural aspects from both cultures, making it distinct and usually done in order to understand the foreign language in the context of the local region. Sometimes the term indigenization is preferred over other terms such as [[Africanization]] because it carries no negative connotations and does not imply any underlying meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African Palimpsest : Indigenization of Language in the West African Europhone Novel|last=Zabus|first=Chantal|publisher=Rodopi|year=1991|isbn=9051831978|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
Indigenization is seen as the process of changing someone to a person of more corroboration towards their surroundings. A large part of that process is the economy of said surroundings. Indigenization has played an important part in the economic roles of society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Thanks to The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]], black people were offered a more distinguished position in the economy, with foreigners having to give up 51% of their business to black people.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-acts-against-foreign-business-owners|title=Zimbabwe acts against foreign business owners {{!}} The National|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Open Door Policy|China’s Open Door Policy]] is seen as a big step of indigenization for their economy, as it is opening its doors to the western world. This allowed different cultures to experience one another and opened up China’s businesses to the western world as well, which set [[China]] forth in a sort of [[Microeconomic reform|economic reform]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Kwok|year=2006|title=The Politics of Indigenization: A Case Study of Development of Social Work in China|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3161&amp;context=jssw|journal=The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|volume=33|issue=2|pages=63–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social work ===
Another big part of indigenization is [[social work]], although it is unknown what the actual process is when social forces come into place.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Indigenization is seen by some as less of a process of naturalization and more of a process of culturally relevant social work. While indigenization wasn’t the standard, it was a way to not only accustom others to a surrounding point of view, but also helping understand both where these people came from and also their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Kim-yee|year=2014|title=Importing Western Values Versus Indigenization: Social work practice with Ethnic Minorities in Hong Kong|url=|journal=International Social Work|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0020872813500804|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that while the indigenization of social work may work when it comes to foreigners being brought into Western cultures, it would not work as well non-Western cultures were those that were being taken in. They also argue that Western cultures seem to exaggerate the similarities and differences between Western and foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenization Measures and Multinational Corporations in Africa|last=Ijalaye|first=David|publisher=Oceana Publications|year=1978|isbn=9024727332|location=New York|pages=41|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act ===
The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]] was passed by [[Parliament of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe Parliament]] in 2008. It is a set of regulations meant to regulate businesses, compelling foreign-owned firms to sell 51-percent of their business to blacks over the following years. Five-year jail terms are assigned to foreigners who do not submit an indigenisation plan or use locals as fronts for their businesses.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The intent of the law is to ensure the country’s black members fulfill a more prominent role in the economy. Controversy rose over this intent, with opponents stating that the law will scare away foreign investors. Indigenous [[Demographics of Zimbabwe|Zimbabweans]] are defined as "any person who, before the 18th April, 1980 [when [[Zimbabwe]] gained independence from [[British Empire|Britain]]], was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race, and any descendant of such person, and includes any company, association, syndicate or partnership of which indigenous Zimbabweans form the majority of the members or hold the controlling interest".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This provision allows the minister of youth development, indigenization and economic empowerment, [[Saviour Kasukuwere]], to keep a database of indigenous businesses from which foreign interest can pick partners from. At the time of the law passing, the ruling party in Zimbabwe was [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|Zanu-PF]], lead by the president [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Saviour Kasukuwere is a member of this party, which brought up skepticism among economists who speculated that the database may be used by the party to give its allies the best deals. Mr. Kasukuwere stated that he will implement the law regardless of objections.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

'''''Instituto del Tercer Mundo''''' (ITeM, or the Third World Institute)  is a Non-Governmental Organization that performs information, communication and education activities. ITeM, which was established in 1989, shares the same secretariat and coordinating personnel as [[Social Watch]] and is based in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100022045&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Activities==

The organization describes itself as a civil society organization that encourages citizen involvement in global decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.item.org.uy/about&lt;/ref&gt;Among its principle aims are to:
*contribute to the construction and enhancement of democracy 
*promote a respect for human rights, 
*promote national and international networking among citizens' organizations, and 
*contribute to the study and solutions of problems affecting the [[Third World]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.item.org.uy/eng/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization places civil society organizations as key agents in the process of social transformation and focuses on information, communication, and education activities on an international level. It has produced original research and critical policy analysis, and has built electronic communication networks through Chasque. 

The organization has been known for the publication of ''The World Guide'' (formerly called the ''Third World Guide''), which acted as a reference book focusing on diverse global issues and concerns, as seen from the perspective of the [[Global South]].

'''The International Science Festival in Gothenburg''' (Swedish: '''Vetenskapsfestivalen''') is an annual [[festival]] in [[Gothenburg]] with science activities.

== About the festival ==
The International Science Festival in Gothenburg took place for the first time in April 1997 and is since then an annual recurrent event.
The purpose is to communicate science to the public and schools in an easy accessible and in a thought provoking manner&lt;!--check translation--&gt;. Another objective is to create a positive attitude to [[research]] and [[science]] which is intended to encourage [[Education in Sweden#Higher education|higher education]].

'''International communication''' (also referred to as the ''[[study of global communication]]'' or '''transnational communication''') is the communication practice that occurs across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and time–space compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543–553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. H. Downing]] proposed ten categories within which international communication should be conducted
# [[theories of international communication]]
# [[core international communication processes]]
# [[global media firms]]
# [[global media policies]]
# [[Global news flow]]s
# [[world cinema]]
# [[development communication]]
# [[the Internet]]
# [[intellectual property law]]
# [[non-hegemonic communication flows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downing|first=John D.

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

[[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; For topics and issues not directly addressed in these primary sources, sharia is derived. The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

Some apply all or a majority of the sharia, and these include [[Legal system of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan#Sharia law|Sudan]], [[Judicial system of Iran|Iran]], [[Law of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Law of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Legal system of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Legal system of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar#Sharia law|Qatar]], [[Legal system of Yemen|Yemen]] and [[Mauritania]].

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies.

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad. Verses such as "Do not follow the unbelievers, but struggle against them mightily" (25.52) and "fight [those who have been given a revelation] who do not believe in God  and the last day" (9.29) may originally have been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but could be redirected once a new set of enemies appeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani]].

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world.

[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H.

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".

On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Qur'an that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheline R. Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G.

("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===
{{Main article|Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Hudud|Qisas|Tazir}}

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against [[Allah]]; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

==Terrorism==

{{Jihadism sidebar}}
{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with [[Muslim theology]].&lt;ref name="Osborn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Lynn Osborn|title=Our New Husbands Are Here: Households, Gender, and Politics in a West African State from the Slave Trade to Colonial Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vFHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4397-2|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Müller|title=Religion and Chieftaincy in Ghana: An Explanation of the Persistence of a Traditional Political Institution in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T890Drkv9AoC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90360-0|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot Year (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|resulting from the September 11 attacks]], while others have associated it with the increased presence of [[Islam in the United States|Muslims]] in the [[Islamophobia in the United States|United States]], the [[European Union]] and other [[secular state|secular nations]].

===Favorable perceptions===
{{See also|Liberal Muslim movements|Cultural Muslim}}

In response to these perceptions, [[Ram Puniyani]], a [[secular]] activist and writer, says that "Islam does not condone violence but, like other religions, does believe in self-defence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times |first=Ram |last=Puniyani|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Juergensmeyer]] describes the teachings of Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror in the mind of God: the global rise of religious violence |first=Mark |last=Juergensmeyer |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Qur%27an+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eUsMTZ37PIqcsQON5uCJCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Qur%27an%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ralph W. Hood]], Peter C. Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra |last=Muzaffar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002|page=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-C8HTdGqOoOusAPNn4DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[South America]]'''. Separatism includes [[autonomism]] and [[secession]]ism. What is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
#They are active movements with living, active members.
#They are seeking greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region.
#They are citizens/peoples of the conflict area and not from another country.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following:
*''De facto'' state: for regions with ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy from the government
*Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding [[sovereign state]]
*Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession
**''De facto'' autonomous government: for governments with ''de facto'' autonomous control over a region
**Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control
**Political party (or parties): for [[Political party|political parties]] involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession
**Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations
**Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]]
**[[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s)

It is defined as, "engaging in two or more overlapping, synchronous conversations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.degarmo.com/multicommunicating-effectively-to-increase-productivity|title=Multicommunicating Effectively to Increase Productivity {{!}} DeGarmo|website=www.degarmo.com|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term multicommunicating was coined by Turner, Reinsch and Tinsley,&lt;ref name="Turner, J. W. 2008"&gt;Turner, J. W., Reinsch, L. &amp; Tinsley, C. (2008). Multicommunicating: A practice whose time has come? Academy of Management Review, 33(2), 391-403.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose that [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] conversations can be conducted using an ever increasing array of media, including face-to-face, phone and email tools for [[communication]]. Multicommunicating evolves with the rapid development of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]. It has become more and more prevalent in recent years and it has received attention from academic fields. Up to now, the majority of academic [[research]] focuses on its professional implications and outlines a number of key factors shaping the act of multicommunicating. For instance, the flexibility of communication tempo, the compartmentalization of conversations, and the topics and intensity of interactions are all contributing factors toward a person's choice of engaging in multicommunicating as well as his or her ultimate success with the practice.

The reason why multicommunicating is possible from a physiological and [[Cognition|cognitive]] perspective is because humans, or '''presence allocators''', are typically able to think faster than they are able to talk or type.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. W. 2008"/&gt; Nonetheless, most neuroscience studies imply that we are not truly cognitively capable of multitasking; we are just able to switch between tasks. This means that those of us who are most adept at apparent multitasking, or multicommunicating, are essentially very quick at juggling our attention(s) between messages.&lt;ref&gt;Ocasio, W. (2011). Attention to Attention. Journal of Organizational Science, 22(5), 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, many people engage in multiple conversations as a direct response to the requests of others. Employees frequently believe that multicommunicating increases their [[productivity]] and work [[efficiency]], however in-depth interviews about the practice of multicommunicating have often revealed some mixed results. Research has also shown that the most commonly used combinations for multicommunicating are the telephone and email, followed by the telephone and text-based messaging (text message, instant message, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (no year). Multicommunicating and Interpersonal Presence: Developing New Constructs for Studying New Phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a concept, multicommunicating primarily builds off [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s work on [[polychronicity]], [[Goffman]]'s theory of the presentation of self, and [[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's notion of [[Media richness theory|media richness]]; Multicommunicating is also similar in nature to the notion of [[human multitasking|multitasking]]. However, where multicommunicating departs from all of these previous concepts is that it refers specifically to managing multiple conversations, people and media&amp;nbsp;– not just tasks&amp;nbsp;– at the same time. Stephen, Cho and Ballard elucidate this distinction in a 2011 paper which compares dovetailing (sequential communication) with mutlicommunication (simultaneous interactions).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, K., Cho, J., &amp; Ballard, D. (2012). Simultaneity, Sequentiality, and Speed: Organizational Messages About Multiple-Task Completion. Human Communication Research, 38(1), 23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, multicommunicating often occurs unbeknown to one's communication partners.

Multicommunicating is closely related to [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s 1959 work on [[polychronicity]]; in fact, multicommunicating was initially called 'polychronic communication' in one of Turner and Reinsch' first scholarly presentations of the concept to the wider academic community.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (2005). Polychronic Communication in the Workplace: The Temporal Structure of "Connected Time". Paper Presented at the National Communication Association Conference, Boston, MA, November, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1959 book ''The Silent Language'' Hall coined the term polychronicity and in subsequent works developed the argument that polychronicity is a measure of a culture's preference toward engaging in several activities at a time. An important conceptual transition then occurred in the late 90's, when Bluedron&lt;ref&gt;Bluedorn, A. C., et al. (1999). Polychronicity and the inventory of polychronic values (IVP): The development of an instrument to measure a fundamental dimension of organizational culture. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 14(3/4), 205-230.&lt;/ref&gt; became one of the first scholars to adapt the term polychronicity from the cultural context and to apply it to the workplace.

[[Goffman]]'s theory of [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self]], which suggests that people engage in a world of multistage dramas, also plays an informing role in the construction of multicommunicating. The notion that we tailor our behavior to suit our environmental contexts and situations is indeed, true in conversations, too. Nonetheless, where multicommunicating differentiates itself from Goffman's theory of the presentation of self is that a 'presence allocator' picks up their appropriate behavior cues from the interaction and the [[Media (communication)|medium]] itself as opposed to the 'actor', who picks up his or her cues for appropriate behavior from their physical environment.

[[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's research on media richness theory or, how employees choose which technologies to use in the workplace, is another important concept for multicommunicating. Similar to [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'s notion of '[[The Medium Is the Massage|the medium is the message]]', Daft and Lengel argue that different media have varying qualities that make them more or less suited for certain interactions. For example, a relatively complex interaction, such as an important conversation with a new business partner, will likely be carried out with as rich a medium as possible. This rich medium would be a communication technology, like Skype or even a face-to-face conversation, which would allow for maximum information and submersion in the interaction. Conversely, a more casual and routine conversation, such as the making of lunch plans with a co-worker, could easily be carried out over a less contextually rich medium like an office chat or a text message.

Organizational norms shape the frequency and usage of multicommunication within an organization. In this sense, the practice of multicommunicating is a type of multiple media practices, also known as [[multimedia]], because people often use more than one media when engaging in multiple conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951778628|title=The international encyclopedia of organizational communication|others=Scott, Craig R. (Craig Richard),, Lewis, Laurie K.,, Barker, James R. (James Robert), 1957-, Keyton, Joann,, Kuhn, Timothy,, Turner, Paaige K.,|isbn=9781118955604|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=951778628}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media ecology|Media Ecology]] theory centers on the principles that  there is a strong connection between media, technology and communication, and how media and communication processes influence human perception, feeling, understanding and value, and usually all three are used when engaged in multiple conversations in a technology enriched workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844725577|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth edition|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Multicommunicating takes the medium selection concept from media richness theory and suggests that some of the same characteristics that contribute to making medium choices may also contribute to the reasons a person might multicommunicate.  For example, if a conversation is not very complicated or equivocal, a person might be more likely to engage in multiple conversations.  A conversation that is more complicated might make it hard for multicommunicating to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (2007). The Business Communicator as Presence Allocator: Multicommunicating, Equivocality, and Status at Work (2007). Journal of Business Communication, 44(1), 36-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely connected to [[media richness theory]] is also the notion of [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion Theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, J., &amp; Zmud, R. (1995). Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential.  The Academy of Management Journal, 42(2), 153-170.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that as an individual becomes more familiar with a specific [[technology]], his or her perception of its capabilities and richness expands. Thus, somebody who is very comfortable with a certain chat site may perceive it to be richer in contextual nature than somebody who is only familiar with its most basic functionalities. This contributes to our understanding of multicommunicating in the sense that a persons' experience with various media may make them more adept at picking up contextually rich conversation signals as well as more prepared for handling certain communication technologies. However, even though [[channel expansion theory]] implies there are positive effects associated with the familiarity of a technology, this does not necessarily suggest that as a person's perception of media richness increases, the process of multicommunicating becomes simplified.

== Versus multitasking ==
The difference between multicommunicating and [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] can be confusing since both of the terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. Scholars in the field of communication have made clear definition of the relationship between these two phenomena. They believe that multitasking has broader scope than multicommunicating which is one complex form of multitasking. Multitasking refers to a user engaging in multitasking behavior when s/he performs more than one unrelated  task concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benbunan-Fich|first=Raquel|last2=Adler|first2=Rachel F.|last3=Mavlanova|first3=Tamilla|date=2011-07-01|title=Measuring Multitasking Behavior with Activity-based Metrics|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1970378.1970381|journal=ACM Trans.

Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two.

In addition to multicommunicating, multitasking also includes electronic multitasking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/06/08/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt; invisible whispering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Alan R.|last2=Rennecker|first2=Julie A.|last3=Hansen|first3=Sean|date=2010-11-01|title=Invisible Whispering: Restructuring Collaborative Decision Making with Instant Messaging|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00290.x/abstract|journal=Decision Sciences|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=845–886|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00290.x|issn=1540-5915}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social multitasking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=05/09/2008|title=Adjusting the Volume: Technology and Multitasking in Discourse Control.|url=|journal=Handbook of mobile communication studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these subcategories are separated from others. They are overlapping with other categories more or less.

==Specific characteristics==

Research suggests that there are two characteristics which help to determine a person's choice of communication media when engaging in multicommunicating: compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo.

===Compartmentalization===
{{Quote_box

 |align=right
 |quote=compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo help to determine the success of an episode of multicommunicating}}
[[Compartmentalization (psychology)|Compartmentalization]] refers to the ability and ease of cross-conversations. For instance, an online chat allows one to relatively freely move from one conversation to another. In this case, the ability to hide conversations from the multiple communication partners is an important factor of compartmentalization, too.

===Flexibility of tempo===

Flexibility of tempo refers to the amount of time a person has to respond to a certain message. Face-to-face communication often allows for less flexibility of tempo than does a text message.

Most typically, users choose to combine media technologies such as the telephone (described as non-flexible in tempo and partially compartmentalized) with those such as electronic text (described as high in both flexibility and compartmentalization capabilities). Of course, sometimes presence allocators do not have a choice about one or more of the media they engage with. However, specific combinations of communication media may contribute strongly toward the success or, lack thereof, one has with multicommunicating.

==Successful and unsuccessful instances==

To multicommunicate or not to multicommunicate&amp;nbsp;– what is it that makes an multicommunicating episode successful? Several factors, including '''intensity''', '''topic of conversation''', '''[[Equivocation (information theory)|equivocality]]''', and the '''presence allocator''' themselves may help to determine the outcomes of an [[episode]] of multicommunicating.

=== Intensity of communication ===
'''Intensity''' of communication is one of the key factors in multicommunicating because it helps to predict the amount of attention and importance a specific conversation holds. Typically, conversation intensity increases with more, simultaneous conversations, a faster pace of conversion, a broader range of topics, and a wider mix of [[social role]]s. Overly high intensity has sometimes been reported as a factor for unsuccessful multicommunicating.

=== Topic of conversation ===
The '''topics''' or themes of episodes of multicommunicating are another key factor determining overall success. Put simply, the more alike the themes of the simultaneous conversations, the more congruent an experience and easier a time the presence allocator has in information processing and conversation-switching. Similarly, the more divergent the topics or themes of conversation, the bigger the cognitive strain on the presence allocator and the higher the chance for confusion or conversation mix-ups.

=== Equivocality ===
The notion of '''equivocality''' is closely related to topic or theme of communication and is another key factor, which may help to determine the success of multicommunicating. Equivocality refers to the possibility for misinterpretation and studies suggest that the higher the potential for equivocality in a conversation, the more likely an individual is to pick a medium of communication that is rich in contextual cues, or that has high media-richness. The possibility for equivocality extends to episodes of multicommunicating, too, and could potentially be compounded if one has to switch their attention between media&amp;nbsp;– or does not engage in [[rich-media]] conversations when necessary.

=== Presence allocator ===
There are limits to our working memory that in turn restrict our cognitive information processing capabilities. Performance deteriorates when these limits are exceeded. Because of these limits, performing two tasks at the same time or rapidly switching between two tasks results in decreased task performance in terms of accuracy and response time. These problems can be partially alleviated (but not eliminated) by practice and physical compatibility of the tasks being performed, but they increase with task complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Ann-Frances|last2=Webster|first2=Jane|date=2012-11-08|title=Multicommunicating: Juggling Multiple Conversations in the Workplace|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0446|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=24|issue=2|pages=352–371|doi=10.1287/isre.1120.0446|issn=1047-7047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, research advocates that presence allocators have the most successful experiences with multicommunicating episodes when engaged in multiple conversations with contextually appropriate media around similar topics. Likewise, the frequent reports of unsuccessful multicommunicating episodes include a sense of high intensity, equivocality and theme confusion. In those cases, information overload can occur to the point where a conversation slows down, becomes confounded or altogether stops.

==Implications==

While the study of multicommunicating is still in its emergent stages, it appears to be increasingly relevant to a fast-paced, multitasking society. Some implications of multicommunicating and suggestions for further studies include:

===Productivity===

Most people indicate that they multicommunicate in order to become more efficient. However, this goal of efficiency has received some mixed results. Despite the notion that getting several things done at once makes us more productive, research has indicated that polychronicity is negatively correlated with deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, C.F., Lane, P.M. and Lindquist, J.D. (1991). Exploring More than 24 Hours a Day: A Preliminary Investigation of Polychronic Time Use. Journal of Consumer Research, 18, 392–401.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, when it comes to communication and multiple conversations many people reveal a breaking point, at which they can no longer juggle [[Synchronity|synchronous]] messages. Significant numbers of research subjects also indicate that they prefer to stay away from multicommunicating altogether when it comes to important conversations which require strong attention.

Several scholars also hypothesized that perceived communication workload can influence people engaging in multicommunicating. Since perceived heavy workload gives people a sense of loss of time, which may result to people compensating for the effect of being overloaded by multicommunicating. However, as revealed by related research results, perceived communication overload did not predict meeting multitasking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stephens|first = Keri K.|last2 = Davis|first2 = Jennifer|date = 2009-06-08|title = The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/06/08/0893318909335417|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|language = en|doi = 10.1177/0893318909335417|issn = 0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perceived incivility ===
By employing the [[social exchange theory]], which views social behavior as "an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige" where "persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them",&lt;ref&gt;Homans, G. C. 1958. Social behavior as exchange. Amer. J. Sociol. 63(3) 597–606.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmeno and Webster examine the relational outcomes of multicommunicating from the following aspects: Partners-VS Focal-Initiated Conversation, Conversation Leveraging, Multicommunicating Performance, Focal Individual Accessibility, Partner's Polychronic Communication Orientation, Awareness and Media Fit. In their research, they suggest that Multicommunicating has the potential to build up or damage our workplace relationships. And the incivility perceived in multicommunicating may lead to mistrust in working places.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cameron, A., &amp; Webster, J. (2010). Relational Outcomes of Multicommunicating: Integrating Incivility and Social Exchange Perspectives. Organizational Science, 22(3), 754-771.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical uses of this theory ==

=== '''Personal Interaction''' ===
Staying “connected has become a societal norm and a personal habit in our society, especially with the development of new information communication technologies (ICTs). Bayer, Campbell &amp; Ling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayer|first=Joseph B.|last2=Campbell|first2=Scott W.|last3=Ling|first3=Rich|date=2015-11-24|title=Connection Cues: Activating the Norms and Habits of Social Connectedness|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/26/2/128/4061221|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=128–149|doi=10.1111/comt.12090|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain how individuals internalize and activate social connectedness during daily life. The model outlined typed of connection cues, factors, that moderate sensitivity to connection norms, and activation paths for connection habits. But what does it really mean to stay “connected”? Does it mean that our physical presence also determines our social presence? The research done by Turner &amp; Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jeanine Warisse|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K|date=2018-02-01|title=Options for the Construction of Attentional Social Presence in a Digitally Enhanced Multicommunicative Environment|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/28/1/22/4944963?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=22–45|doi=10.1093/ct/qty002|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;” suggests that there are four types of presences when we engage in multiple conversations: '''budgeted''', '''entitled''', '''competitive''' and '''invitational'''. 

* Budgeted presence happens when you engage in multiple conversations at once,for instance, talking to your friend while also sending an email.
* Entitled presence happens when you can take your audience’s technology away or someone takes  your technology away, for instance, you're in class and the professor asks to put your phones away.
* Competitive presence happens when you try to persuade other people or group of people to pay attention to you, and you seem to have to compete with their communication technology, for instance, when you're trying to share a personal story with your friend, but they're on their phone and are not paying attention to you.
* Invitational presence happens when you decide to focus on your audience and you are making a concrete effort to be in the moment (only one conversation), you are focused only on that interaction, for instance, you are having a one-on-one conversation with your friend, there is no technology involved and there are no distractions. 

Each presence involves the control of our audience and technology, the choices we make, and how we interact. 

Is there a way to measure our social presence? In her paper “Toward a more robust theory and measure of social presence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biocca|first=Frank|last2=Harms|first2=Chad|last3=Burgoon|first3=Judee K.|date=2003-10|title=Toward a More Robust Theory and Measure of Social Presence: Review and Suggested Criteria|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/105474603322761270|journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=456–480|doi=10.1162/105474603322761270|issn=1054-7460}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Biocca, Harms &amp; Burgoon contribute to the understanding of social behavior in mediated environments, which allows researchers to predict and measure differences among interfaces and guide the design of new social environments and interfaces

===Organizational norms and perceptions===
Multicommunicating is especially present in team collaborations. In order to be more effective in their workplace, teams would use different platforms for their communication practices. There are a number of communication platforms such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] that include multiple '''Social Media Channels''' (social networking platforms and instant messaging). The media capabilities of these platforms, including integrations for diverse information and communication technologies, enable '''[[Affordance|affordances]]''' for both highly adaptable and centralized team communication practices. A recent research shows that team communication platforms (also known as TCPs) enable affordances for multicommunication and attention allocation including flexible scaling of '''media modality''' and '''synchronicity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anders|first=Abram|date=2016-01-19|title=Team Communication Platforms and Emergent Social Collaboration Practices|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F2329488415627273|journal=International Journal of Business Communication|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=224–261|doi=10.1177/2329488415627273|issn=2329-4884}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In organizational settings, research suggests that individual's decisions to use informational communication technology are influenced by what they observe other members do in the organization, which is positive related to their multicommunicating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|date=2009|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of what others think about multicommunicating is also another significant predictor on this behaviors. Often, people hide the fact that they are multicommunicating from their conversational partners because they report an underlying perception of rudeness or partiality of conversational investment associated with multicommunicating. However, if people perceive that multicommunicating is acceptable in the organizations, they will not feel embarrassed and will engage in this kind of behaviors more often.

Depending on the organizational culture, multicommunicating can become particularly crucial and bear negative effects in a professional or office setting. Conversely, research suggests that employees who follow [[organizational communication]] norms receive higher performance ratings than those who don't. therefore, if multicommunicating were considered an organizational '[[Norm (social)|norm]]', its practice could also bring positive feedback.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While multicommunicating can be a controversial topic in research and practice, it is an increasingly common organizational realty. Further research into cognitive abilities, organizational settings and expanding virtual work opportunities, as well as technology will likely carry significant findings for our personal and professional lives.

=== Multicommunication on Workplace Productivity ===
Multicimmunication can change the ways in which teams work and interact within the organization.

An important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others. In their research Stephens and Davis (2009) talk about the social influences on electronic multitasking in organizational meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63–83|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have infiltrated meetings and allowed a new range of communicative behaviors to emerge. The observation of organizational norms and the perception of others’ thoughts concerning the use of ICTs for multitasking during a meeting explain a considerable amount of variance in how individuals use ICTs to communicate electronically in meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63–83|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Relating to this point, Belanger and Watson (2006) made a study exploring how virtual team members structure their use of multiple media to attain strategic goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bélanger|first=France|last2=Watson-Manheim|first2=Mary Beth|date=2006-07|title=Virtual Teams and Multiple Media: Structuring Media Use to Attain Strategic Goals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=299–321|doi=10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|issn=0926-2644}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In today’s work environment, individuals working in teams must learn to manage their time for communication and coordination, and to add to this complexity teams can range from completely virtual environments to face-to-face and all the technologies that are involved. Cardon and Dai (2014) did a study that examines the nature of mobile phone use in meetings among Chinese professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=W.|first=Cardon, Peter|last2=Ying|first2=Dai,|date=2014|title=Mobile Phone Use in Meetings among Chinese Professionals: Perspectives on Multicommunication and Civility|url=https://commons.emich.edu/gabc/vol3/iss1/2/|journal=Global Advances in Business Communication|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2164-1692}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using mobile phones in meetings is a form of multicommunicaion, but the etiquette associated with mobile phone use differ across cultures. Multicommunicating via mobile phones in meetings is mostly client-based and relationship-based, and it changes among cultures and across generations.

{{Expand French|Mutilation|date=December 2014}}
'''Mutilation''' or '''maiming''' (from the Latin: ''mutilus'') is cutting off or injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mutilation |volume=19 |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. [[scarification]], [[burn]]ing, [[flagellation]], [[tattooing]], or [[breaking wheel|wheeling]], as part of a [[rite of passage]]. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.

The traditional Chinese practices of [[Slow slicing|''língchí'']] and [[foot binding]] are forms of mutilation. One form of mutilation that has captured the imagination of Westerners is the "long-neck" people, a sub-group of the [[Karen people|Karen]] known as the [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] where women wear brass rings around their neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangdao.com/chiangmai/karenlongneck.htm|title=Karen Long Neck hilltribe - Padaung, Northern Thailand|publisher=Chiangdao.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[tattoo]]ing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within Christianity. A joint statement released by the [[United Nations]] and numerous other international bodies opposes [[female genital mutilation|female circumcision]] as a form of mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Eliminating Female genital mutilation - An interagency statement | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | isbn = 978-92-4-159644-2 | url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/fgm/fgm_statement_2008.pdf | format = pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not [[male circumcision]] amounts to mutilation is a subject of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denniston, G.

[[Castration]] is also a form of mutilation, as are [[body piercing]], some forms of extreme [[body modification]], and some [[cosmetic surgery]].

==Punishment==
''Maiming'', or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of [[physical punishment]], especially applied on the principle of [[an eye for an eye]].

The [[mapuche|Araucanian]] warrior [[Galvarino]] suffered this punishment as a prisoner during the Spanish [[conquest of Chile]].

In law, maiming is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], an [[Anglo]]-[[French language|French]] variant form of the word.

Maiming of animals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offence generally grouped as malicious damage. For the purpose of the law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny at common [[law]] or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic purposes.

In Britain under the [[Malicious Damage Act 1861]] the punishment for maiming of cattle was three to fourteen years penal servitude; malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is imprisonment with hard labor for over twelve months.  Maiming of animals by their owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.

==Mutilation as human punishment== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dock]] --&gt;
In times when even judicial [[physical punishment]] was still commonly allowed to cause not only intense pain and [[public humiliation]] during the administration but also to inflict permanent physical damage, or even deliberately intended to mark the criminal for life by [[docking (animal)|docking]] or [[human branding|branding]], one of the common anatomical target areas not normally under permanent cover of clothing (so particularly merciless in the long term) were the ear(s).
[[File:Un pauvre averti Gontran - Frédégonde ordonne la mutilation d'Olericus.jpg|thumb|[[Fredegund]] ordering the mutilation of Olericus.]]
In England, for example, various pamphleteers attacking the religious views of the Anglican episcopacy under [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had their ears cut off for those writings: in 1630 Dr. [[Alexander Leighton]] and in 1637 still other [[Puritans]], [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (puritan)|Henry Burton]] and [[William Prynne]].

In Scotland one of the [[Covenanters]], James Gavin of [[Douglas, Lanarkshire]], had his ears cut off for refusing to renounce his religious faith. In Japan, [[Gonsalo Garcia]] and his companions were similarly punished.

Notably in various jurisdictions of colonial British North America, even relatively minor crimes, such as hog stealing, were punishable by having one's ears nailed to the [[pillory]] and slit loose, or even [[cropping (punishment)|cropped]], a [[counterfeiter]] would be branded on top (for that crime, considered [[lèse-majesté]], the older [[mirror punishment]] was boiling in oil), which was an example of western mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, John A. (2003) Historical Viewpoints. New York City, New York: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence did not render American justice any less brutal. For example, in the future state of Tennessee, an example of harsh 'frontier law' under the 1780 [[Cumberland Compact]] took place in 1793 when Judge [[John McNairy]] sentenced Nashville's first horse thief, John McKain, Jr., to be fastened to a wooden stock one hour for 39 lashes, have his ears cut off and cheeks [[branding persons|branded]] with the letters "H" and "T".

[[Tongue cutting]] is also a form of mutilation as this leads to bleeding to death in most cases with choking in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/pun.html|title=A History of Punishments|publisher=Localhistories.org|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nebahne Yohannes]], an unsuccessful claimant to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian imperial throne]] who had his ears and nose cut off, yet was then freed. This form of mutilation against unsuccessful claimants to thrones has been in use in middle-eastern regions for thousands of years. To qualify as a king, formerly, one had to exemplify perfection. Obvious physical deformities such as missing noses, ears, or lips, are thereby sufficient disqualifications. The victim in these cases is typically freed alive to act (''a'') as an example to others, and (''b'') as no longer a threat.

== Terpenoids ==
[[File:Verbenone3D.png|thumb|The [[terpenoid]] [[verbenone]] is a plant [[pheromone]], signalling to insects that a tree is already infested by beetles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Mafra-Neto | first1=Agenor| last2=de Lame | first2=Frédérique M.  | last3=Fettig | first3=Christopher J. | last4=Perring | first4=Thomas M. | last5=Stelinski | first5=Lukasz L.  | last6=Stoltman | first6=Lyndsie L.| last7=Mafra | first7=Leandro E.

{{further|Terpenoid}}

Terpenoids facilitate communication between plants and insects, mammals, fungi, microorganisms, and other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Llusià |first=Joan |last2=Estiarte |first2=Marc |last3=Peñuelas |first3=Josep |date=1996 |title=Terpenoids and plant communication |journal=Bull. Inst. Cat. Hist. Nat |volume=64 |pages=125–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terpenoids may act as both attractants and repllants for various insects. For example, pine shoot beetles (''[[Tomicus piniperda]]'') are attracted to certain monoterpenes ( (+/-)-[[A-Pinene|a-pinene]], (+)-[[Carene|3-carene]] and terpinolene) produced by Scots pines ''([[Scots pine|Pinus sylvestris]]''), while being repelled by others (such as [[verbenone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J. A. |last2=Lanne |first2=B. S. |last3=Löfqvist |first3=J. |date=1989-05-01 |title=Host tree unsuitability recognized by pine shoot beetles in flight |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01952042 |journal=Experientia |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=489–492 |doi=10.1007/BF01952042|issn=0014-4754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terpenoids are a large family of biological molecules with over 22,000 compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/497430488|title=Dictionary of terpenoids |last=Hill |first=Ruaraidh |last2=Connolly |first2=J.D. |date=1991 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |year=1971 |isbn=041225770X |pages= |oclc=497430488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terpenoids are similar to [[terpene]]s in their carbon skeleton but unlike terpenes contain [[functional group]]s. The structure  of terpenoids is described by the [[biogenetic isoprene rule]] which states that terpenoids can be thought of being made of [[isoprenoid]] subunits, arranged either regularly or irregularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The isoprene rule and the biogenesis of terpenic compounds |first=Leopold |last=Ružička |journal=[[Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences]] |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=357–367 |year=1953 |doi=10.1007/BF02167631 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02167631}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biosynthesis of terpenoids occurs via the [[Non-mevalonate pathway|methylerythritol phosphate]] (MEP) and  [[Mevalonate pathway|mevalonic acid]](MVA) pathways&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; both of which include [[Isopentenyl pyrophosphate|isopentenyl diphosphate]] (IPP) and [[Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate|dimethylallyl diphosphate]] (DMAPP) as key compenents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McGarvey |first=Douglas J. |last2=Croteau |first2=Rodney |date=July 1995 |title=Terpenoid Metabolism |jstor=3870054 |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=7 |pages=1015–1026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEP pathway produces [[hemiterpene]]s, [[monoterpene]]s, [[diterpene]]s, and volatile [[carotenoid]] derivatives while the MVA pathway produces [[sesquiterpene]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5449">'''Prison religion''' includes the [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices of [[prison]] [[Wikt:Inmate|inmates]], usually stemming from or including concepts surrounding their imprisonment and accompanying lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html ''Religion in Prison''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702212124/http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html |date=2007-07-02 }}. Harry R. Dammer, University of Scranton&lt;/ref&gt; "Prison Ministry" is a larger concept, including the support of the spiritual and religious needs of prison guards and staff, whose work in an often demanding and brutal environment often creates a special need for pastoral care, similar to the care that is extended to the military, police officers and fire fighters.

==History==
[[File:Prison de Sainte-Pélagie - Chapelle.jpg|thumb|The chapel of the Saint-Pélagie Prison, Paris]]
Many religious groups often supply scripture and reading material, organize programs and worship, and train [[chaplains]] for work in prisons. Members of religious groups also engage in missionary activity, as there have been many instances of conversion throughout history.  For instance, one of the earliest introductions of [[Islam]] into [[Eastern Europe]] was through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] during their war against Muslims.  The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the [[Pechenegs]], where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O45CAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+walker+arnold+preaching&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vh74TLilEIOdlgfN34ifAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith''. Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, early [[colonists]] originated the concept of the [[prison|penitentiary]] as a place where inmates would demonstrate their [[penance]] and remorse for their crimes through prayer and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Clear, Todd R., Cole, George F., Reisig, Michael D. 2008. ''American Corrections''. Florence, KY: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

English prison chaplains also heard confessions from condemned prisoners, some of which were published – for example, the 18th century ''[[Ordinary of Newgate's Account]]''. Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation.

Chaplains have worked with prisoners and prison staff for many years, even before formal legislation addressed the constitutional rights of inmates.

A 2005 ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' study suggests that the practice of religion significantly reduces the chance of prisoners to engage in verbal or physical [[Wikt:altercation|altercations]], and increases the likelihood of reform after completing prison sentence time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070323195324/http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87547 ''UAB Study Finds Religion Helps Reduce Negative Prison Behaviors'']. Gail Short, UAB.edu, citing: Kent R. Kerley, Todd L. Matthews and Troy C. Blanchard. (2005) "Religiosity, Religious Participation, and Negative
Prison Behaviors." ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. 44(4):443–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for religious involvement==
[[File:Rabbi Philip Alstat.jpg|thumb|right|Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, c. 1920]]

Prisoners may become involved with religion while incarcerated for a variety of reasons ranging from the materially pragmatic to the personal and spiritual.  According to research conducted by sociologist Harry R. Dammer, some of the more prominent reasons include:
#Gaining direction and meaning in one's life.
#Improving one's concept of self.
#Promoting personal behavioral change.
#Gaining protection.
#Meeting other inmates.
#Meeting volunteers.
#Obtaining prison resources.&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R.  2006.  "Religion in prison."  In ''Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', edited by Marylin D. McShane and Frank P. Williams III.  New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R. 1992. ''Piety in Prison''. Ann Arbor: University Microfilms.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]], who served as Jewish chaplain for [[The Tombs]], the Manhattan Detention Facility, for thirty years, and also served as the Secretary of the National Jewish Council of Prison Chaplains, shared his vision of prison ministry by saying,  "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities – to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fiske, ''New York Times'', "City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy", Oct 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">The job of the '''public editor''' is to supervise the implementation of proper [[journalism ethics]] at a newspaper, and to identify and examine critical errors or omissions, and to act as a liaison to the public. They do this primarily through a regular feature on a newspaper's [[editorial]] page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they're criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.

Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their [[Ombudsman#News ombudsman|ombudsman]], though this is not always so. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the [[Organisation of News Ombudsmen]].

The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo's ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' and ''[[Louisville Times]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Ananny, "It’s time to reimagine the role of a public editor, starting at The New York Times," Nieman Lab, March 17, 2016, Neiman Foundation at Harvard, URL=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/mike-ananny-its-time-to-reimagine-the-role-of-a-public-editor-starting-at-the-new-york-times/&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''[[The New York Times]]'', the position was created in response to the [[Jayson Blair#Plagiarism and fabrication scandal|Jayson Blair scandal]]. The ''Times''' first public editor was [[Daniel Okrent]], who held the position from December 2003 through May 2005.  Okrent's successor was [[Byron Calame]], who was followed by [[Clark Hoyt]], who held the position for three years. In August 2010, [[Arthur S. Brisbane]] assumed the post and held it until 2012, when [[Margaret M. Sullivan]] took the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/times-names-buffalo-news-editor-as-its-new-public-editor/|title=Times Names Buffalo News Editor as Its New Public Editor|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|date=16 July 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April, 2016, Sullivan left the position to become a media columnist at the ''[[Washington Post]]''; her last column for the ''Times'' was dated April 16.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sullivan, "Public Editor No. 5 Is Yesterday’s News," The New York Times, April 16, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/public-editor/margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;  She was replaced by [[Elizabeth Spayd]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Ember, "New York Times Names Elizabeth Spayd Its 6th Public Editor", The New York Times, May 18, 2016, URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/media/new-york-times-names-elizabeth-spayd-its-6th-public-editor.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 31, 2017, the ''Times'' announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/business/media/new-york-times-buyouts.html |title=New York Times Will Offer Employee Buyouts and Eliminate Public Editor Role |work=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I.

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G.

New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.).

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**The implementation of ''school-wide early-warning systems'', the school equivalent of a [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]]-like surveillance operation designed to "prevent the worst cases of school violence," has been problematic.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; Recent developments in early threat assessment, however, show promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15388220.2010.519432 | pmid = | title = Development, Evaluation, and Future Directions of the Virginia Student Threat Assessment Guidelines | year = 2011 | last1 = Cornell | first1 = Dewey | last2 = Allen | first2 = Korrie | journal = [[Journal of School Violence]] | volume = 10 | pages = 88–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence-prevention efforts can also be usefully directed at developing anti-bullying programs, helping teachers with classroom-management strategies, applying behavioral strategies such as the Good Behavior Game, implementing curricular innovations such as the Second Step syllabus, developing programs to strengthen families (see below), and implementing programs aimed at enhancing the social and academic skills of at-risk students (see below).
* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders. Thus, whether and how teachers intervene in the case of bullying is of great importance. Research has shown that teachers prefer authority-based interventions towards bullies but seem to neglect to support the victims.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Burger| first      = Christoph| last2      = Strohmeier| first2     = Dagmar| last3      = Spröber| first3     = Nina| last4      = Bauman| first4     = Sheri| last5      = Rigby| first5     = Ken| date       = 2015| title      = How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies.| url        = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004| journal    = Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51| pages      = 191–202| doi        = 10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, most teacher training curricula do not include preventive and interventive skills regarding school violence.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"/&gt;

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L.

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

The '''Seshat: Global History Databank''' is an international [[scientific research]] project of the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Evolution Institute]]. Founded in 2011, the [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''Seshat: Global History Databank''] gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a [[Digital humanities|digital storehouse]] for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

The Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of [[Cliodynamics]]. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the [[scientific method]] to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turchin |first=Peter |title= Arise cliodynamics |journal=Nature |date=2008 |doi= 10.1038/454034a |pmid=18596791 |volume=454 |issue=7200 |pages=34–35}} http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural evolutionary theory]] or [[Cultural evolutionism|cultural evolutionary theory]] to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.

== Project ==

The Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of [[social complexity]] in early civilizations, the creation of [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]] (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of [[ritual]] and [[religion]] in [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], the causes of [[economic growth]] and its consequences on individual's [[well-being]], and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge [[Semantic Web|digital technologies]] can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.

Several key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does [[prosocial behavior]] evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info|title=Seshat: Global History Databank - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late [[Neolithic]] (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30/|title=World Sample 30 - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Praise ===

[[Ian Morris (historian)]] recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

[[Gary Feinman]] also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Critics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process. The Seshat project uses multiple coders and experts and other techniques for ensuring data quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collard |first=Mark |last2= Whitehouse |first2= Harvey |last3= Francois |first3= Pieter |last4= Slingerland |first4= Edward |last5= Turchin |first5= Peter |title=A Historical Database of Sociocultural Evolution |journal= Cliodynamics |date=2012 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have recently suggested that machine coding techniques hold great promise for further reducing biases and increasing the reliability of the data produced.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Funding ===

Funding for the Seshat: Global History Databank comes from the [[John Templeton Foundation]], the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[Horizon 2020]], the Tricoastal Foundation, and the Evolution Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-about-us/acknowledgements/|title=Acknowledgements - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

'''Sex segregation''' is the physical, legal, and cultural separation of people according to their biological sex.

In certain circumstances, sex segregation is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Salomone, Rosemary C. "Are Single-Sex Schools Inherently Unequal? Same, Different, Equal: Rethinking Single-Sex Schooling." "Michigan Law Review." 102(6):1219-1244&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics contend that it is a violation of capabilities and [[human rights]] and can create economic inefficiencies, while some supporters argue that it is central to certain religious laws and social and cultural histories and traditions.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"&gt;The World Bank. 2012. "Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012." Washington, D.C: The World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. 2003. "Women's Education: A Global Challenge." "Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society" 29(2): 325–355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term "sex" in "sex segregation" refers to apparent biological distinctions between men and women, used in contrast to "gender".&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"&gt;Cohen, David S. 2010. "The Stubborn Persistence of Sex Segregation." ''Columbia Journal of Gender and Law'' forthcoming 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The term "segregation" refers to separation of the sexes, which can be enforced by rules, laws, and policies, or be a ''[[de facto]]'' outcome in which people are separated by sex. Even as a de facto outcome, "sex segregation" taken as a whole can be caused by societal pressures, historical practices, and socialized preferences. Literally, sex segregation can be physical and spatial separation by sex, but the term is also used for the exclusion of one sex from participation in an occupation, institution, or group. Sex segregation can be complete or partial, as when members of one sex predominate within, but do not exclusively constitute, a group or organization.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

The term [[gender apartheid]] or (sexual apartheid) also has been applied to segregation of people by gender,&lt;ref name=clergy&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women clergy accuse Church of sexual apartheid|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,580180,00.html |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Unlimited | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Bates | date=October 25, 2001 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref name=Otto&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Otto D |title=Holding Up half the Sky, But For Whose Benefit: A Critical Analysis of the Fourth World Conference on Women |journal=Austl Feminist LJ. |month= |year=1996 |volume=7 |issue= |pages= |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/afemlj6&amp;section=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination, its effects have important consequences for [[gender equality]] and equity.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Men not allowed.jpg|thumb|A sign mandating sex segregation on a women's only car in India.]]

==Types==

Sex segregation can occur in both public and private contexts, and be classified in many ways. Legal and [[gender studies]] scholar David S. Cohen offers one taxonomy in categorizing sex segregation as mandatory, administrative, permissive, or voluntary. Mandatory and administrative sex segregation are required and enforced by governments in public environments, while permissive and voluntary sex segregation are stances chosen by public or private institutions, but within the capacity of the law.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Mandatory===

Mandatory sex segregation is legally required and enforces separation based on sex.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Examples include separation of men and women in prisons, law enforcement, military service, restrooms, and housing. These mandatory rules can be nuanced, as in military service, where sexes are often separated in laws about conscription, in housing, and in regulations on which sexes can participate in certain roles, like frontline infantry.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;  Mandatory sex segregation also includes less obvious cases of separation, as when men and women are required to have same-sex attendants for body searches. Mandatory sex segregation can thus dictate parameters for employment in sex segregated spaces, including medical and [[care work]] contexts,  and can be a form of [[occupational segregation]].&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; For example, a government may mandate that clinics hire female nurses to care for female patients.

===Administrative===

Administrative sex segregation involves public and government institutions segregating by sex in their operating capacity, rather than as the result of a formal mandate.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Examples of administrative sex segregation include sex segregation in government sponsored medical research, sports leagues, public hospitals with shared rooms, rehabilitation programs, and some public education facilities. Administrative sex segregation can occur in these environments simply as through the provisioning of sex segregated restrooms despite limited explicit legal requirements to do so.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Permissive===

Permissive sex segregation is segregation which is explicitly permitted by law, i.e. affirmatively authorized, but not necessarily legally required or encouraged.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Permissive sex segregation exempts certain things from anti-[[sex-discrimination]] laws, often allowing for, among others, segregation of religious and military schools, undergraduate schools that have traditionally admitted based on sex, health clubs, athletic teams, social fraternities and sororities, choirs and choruses, voluntary youth service organizations such as the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], father/son and mother/daughter activities, and sex-exclusive beauty pageants and scholarships.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Voluntary===

Sex segregation that is neither legally mandated, nor enacted in an administrative capacity, nor explicitly permitted by law, is recognized as voluntary sex segregation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Voluntary sex segregation refers to lack of explicit legal prescriptions; it does not necessarily indicate the free choice of either the segregated or the segregators, and it may be imposed by social and cultural norms. Voluntary sex segregation takes place in numerous national professional and interest-based membership organizations, local and larger clubs, professional sports teams, private recreational facilities, religious institutions, performing arts, and more.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==
Within [[feminist theory]] and [[feminist legal theory]], there are six main theoretical approaches that can be considered and used to analyze the causes and effects of sex segregation. They include libertarianism, equal treatment, difference feminism, anti-subordination, critical race feminism, and anti-essentialism.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Libertarianism===
{{main article|Libertarianism}}
[[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminist]] theory stems from ideologies similar to libertarian political theory; that legal and governmental institutions should not regulate choices and should allow people's free will to govern their life trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. 1998. "The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law".&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarianism takes a [[free market]] approach to sex segregation saying that women have a natural right and are the most informed to make decisions for themselves but rejects special protections specifically for women.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard. 1989. "Conservative Feminism". University of Chicago Legal F.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomy]] is central to libertarianism, so theorists believe that the government should not interfere with decision making or be concerned with reasoning behind such decisions since men and women culturally and naturally make different and often diverging choices. Policies and laws enforced by the government should not act to change any inherent differences between the sexes.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Richard A. 1999. "Liberty, Patriarchy, and Feminism." University of Chicago Legal F (89).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Libertarianism most directly relates to voluntary sex segregation as it maintains that the government should not regulate private institutions or entities' segregation by sex and should not regulate how individuals privately group themselves.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Libertarian feminist David Berstein argues that while sex segregation can cause harm, guarding the freedom of choice for men and women is more important than preventing such sex segregation since methods of prevention can often cause more harm than good for both sexes. Women's health clubs are an example of how sex segregation benefits women since desegregation would interfere with women's abilities to exercise without the distraction of men and 'ogling' without any direct benefit to allowing men a membership.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David E. 1999. "Sex Discrimination Laws Versus Civil Liberties" University of Chicago Legal F (133).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, libertarians would allow for permissive sex segregation since it allows people to choose how to organize their interactions and relationships with others.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;
Libertarian feminists acknowledge that there is legal precedence for sex segregation laws, but argue for such parameters to ensure equal treatment of similarly situated men and women. As such, libertarianism could allow or reject specific forms of sex segregation created to account for natural or biological differences between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Warnick, Ashlie. 2003. "Women: Freedom and Feminism in the Twenty-First Century." edited by Wendy McElroy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal treatment===
{{main article|Egalitarianism|Equal opportunity}}
Equal treatment theory or formal equity often works in tandem with libertarianism in that equal treatment theorists believe governments should treat men and women similarly when their situations are similar.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine A. 2007. "Sex Equality." 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"&gt;Halley, Janet. 2007. "Split Decisions: How and Why to Take a Break From Feminism." 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, equal treatment theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation.&lt;ref name="Chamallas 2003"&gt;Chamallas, Martha. 2003. "Introduction to Feminist Legal Theory." 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, equal treatment theory was adopted by the many feminists during the United States' feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of equal treatment theory led to the adoption of [[intermediate scrutiny]] as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations.&lt;ref name="Chamallas 2003"/&gt; While equal treatment theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently.&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"/&gt; In this manner, libertarianism and equal treatment theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McSally, Martha. 2007. "Women in Combat: Is the Current Policy Obsolete?" Duke Judicial Gender Law and Policy 1011:14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference feminism===
{{main article|Difference feminism}}
Difference feminism arose from libertarianism and equal treatment theories' perceived failure to create systemic equality for women. Difference feminism celebrates biological, psychological, moral differences between men and women, accusing laws concerning sex segregation of diluting these important differences.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, Nancy and Robert R. M. Verchick. 2006. "Feminist Legal Theory: A Primer." 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Difference feminists believe that such laws not only ignore these important differences, but also can exclude participation of women in the world. Difference feminism's goal is to bring about a consciousness of women's femininity and to cause the revaluation of begin to revalue women's attributes in a more respectful, reverent manner.&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Difference feminism and equal treatment theory are quite contrasting feminist theories of sex segregation. Difference feminism often justifies sex segregation through women's and men's differences while equal treatment theory does not support separation because of differences in sex. Difference feminism, however, argues against segregation that stems from societal and "old-fashioned" differences between men and women, but believes that segregation that takes women's differences into account and promotes equality is acceptable, even going so far as to say that some forms of sex segregation are necessary to ensure equality, such as athletics and education, and policies such as Title IX.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Anti-subordination===
Anti-subordination feminist theory examines sex segregation through power to ultimately whether women are treated or placed subordinately compared to men in a law or situation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; The theory focuses on male dominance and female subordination and promotes destroying a sex-based hierarchy in legal and social institutions and preventing future hierarchies from arising.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine. 1987. "Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law." 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-subordination also supports laws that promote the status of women even if they lower men's status as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Colker. 1986. "Anti-Subordination Above All: Sex, Race, and Equal Protection." NYU Law Review. 61(1003).&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial applications of anti-subordination that can either perpetuate the subordination of women or create the subordination of men include sex segregation in education and in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia F. 1997. "The Myths and Justifications of Sex Segregation in Higher Education: VMI and The Citadel." Duke Gender Law and Pol'y 101:1475-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical race feminism===
{{main article|Critical race theory}}
Critical race feminism developed due to the lack of racial inclusivity of feminist theories and lack of gender inclusivity of racial theories.&lt;ref name="Wing, Adrien Katherine 2003"&gt;Wing, Adrien Katherine. 2003. Introduction to "Critical Race Feminism: A Reader" ed. Adrien Katherine Wing.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is more global than the others, attempting to take into account the intersectionality of gender and race. Critical race feminism demands that theorists reexamine surface-level segregation and focus on how sex segregation stems from different histories, causing different effects based on race, especially for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perpetual Minors|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/04/19/perpetual-minors|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; women of color. This segregation is evident in many racially divided countries, especially in the relationship between the end of race-segregated schools and sex segregation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayeri, Serena. 2006. "The Strange Career of Jane Crow: Sex Segregation and the Transformation of Anti-Discrimination Discourse" Yale Judiciary Law and Humanities 187(257):338.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race feminism critiques other theories' failure to take into account their different applications once race, class, sexual orientation, or other identity factors are included in a segregated situation.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Angela P. 1990. "Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory." Stanford Law Review 42:581-590.&lt;/ref&gt; It creates the need to examine mandatory and administrative sex segregation to determine whether or if they sustain racial stereotypes, particularly towards women of color. Additionally, critical race feminists wonder whether permissive and voluntary sex segregation are socially acceptable manners by which to separate races and sexes or whether they maintain and perpetuate inequalities.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Critical race feminism is a form of anti-essentialism (below).&lt;ref name="Wing, Adrien Katherine 2003"/&gt;

===Anti-essentialism===
Anti-essentialists maintain that sex and gender categories are limiting and fail to include the unlimited variety of difference in human identity and impose identities rather than simply note their differences.&lt;ref&gt;Frug, Mary J. 1992. "Postmodern Legal Feminism." 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levit, Nancy. 1996. "Feminism for Men: Legal Ideology and the Construction of Maleness." UCLA Law Review 1037(1050).&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe that there is variation in what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and by promoting the differences through sex segregation, people are confined to categories, limiting freedom.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Anti-essentialists examine how society imposes specific identities within the sex dichotomy and how subsequently sex and gender hierarchies are created, perpetuated, and normalized.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; This theory requires that there is a specific disentanglement between sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, Francisco. 1995. "Queers, Sissies, Dykes, and Tomboys: Deconstructing the Conflation of "Sex," "Gender," and "Sexual Orientation" in Euro-American Law and Society." California Law Review 83(1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, Mary Anne. 1998. "Unpacking Package Deals: Separate Spheres Are Not the Answer." Denver University Law Review 75 (1305, 1317).&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-essentialists believe that there should not be an idea of what constitutes masculinity or femininity, but that individual characteristics should be fluid to eliminate sex and gender-based stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Sumi and Robert Wesley. 2000. "Critical Race Coalitions: Key Moments that Performed the Theory." 33 (1377, 1416).&lt;/ref&gt; No specific types of sex segregation are outwardly promoted or supported by anti-essentialists since mandatory and administrative sex segregation reinforce power struggles between the sexes and genders while permissive or voluntary forms of sex segregation allow institutions and society to sort individuals into categories with differential access to power, and supporting the government's elimination of such permission for certain institutions and norms to continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, David S. 2009. "No Boy Left Behind? Single-Sex Education and the Essentialist Myth of Masculinity" Indiana Law Journal 84(135).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary policy examples==

Sex segregation is a global phenomenon manifested differently in varying localities.&lt;ref&gt;Grusky, David B., and Maria Charles. 2001. "Is There a Worldwide Sex Segregation Regime?" Pp. 689-703 in Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (Second Edition), edited by David B. Grusky. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex segregation and integration considered harmless or normal in one country can be considered radical or illegal in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gubernskaya|first1=Zoya|title=Attitudes toward Cohabitation in 28 Countries: Does Marital Status Matter?|url=http://paa2008.princeton.edu/papers/80851|website=Princeton|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, many laws and policies promoting segregation or desegregation recur across multiple national contexts. Safety and privacy concerns, traditional values and cultural norms, and belief that sex segregation can produce positive educational and overall social outcomes all shape public policy regarding sex segregation.

===Safety and privacy===

Some sex segregation occurs for reasons of safety and privacy. Worldwide, laws often mandate sex segregation in bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and similar spaces, based on a common perceived need for privacy.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; This type of segregation policy can protect against [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Amnesty International USA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGACT770232007&amp;lang=e |publisher=Amnesty International USA |title=Six Steps to Stop Violence Against Schoolgirls |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624214051/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGACT770232007&amp;lang=e |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat [[groping]], [[street harassment]], and [[eve teasing]] of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated [[women only space]]s. For example, sex-segregated buses, [[women-only passenger car]]s, and compartments on trains have been introduced in [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and other countries to reduce sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Marc Lacey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/world/americas/11mexico.html|title=On Single-Sex Buses, Relief From Unwanted Contact|publisher=New York Times|author=Marc Lacey|work=Mexico City Journal|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Belarus rail targets 'smelly men' | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4439735.stm | accessdate = June 11, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=April 13, 2005 | first=Tatyana | last=Nechapayka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mainichi-disability"&gt;{{Cite news

Sex segregation rooted in safety considerations can furthermore extend beyond the physical to the psychological and emotional as well. A refuge for battered mothers or wives may refuse to admit men, even those who are themselves the victims of domestic violence, both to exclude those who might commit or threaten violence to women and because women who have been subjected to abuse by a male might feel threatened by the presence of any man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/05/domestic-violence-charity-funding |publisher=The Guardian|title=Women's refuges told they must admit men | location=London | first=Gaby | last=Hinsliff | date=April 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's health clinics and women's resource centers, whether in [[Africa]] or [[North America]], are further examples of spaces where sex segregation may facilitate private and highly personal decisions. [[Women-only bank]]s may be similarly intended to provide autonomy to women's decision making.

===Religious and cultural ideas===

Sex segregation can also be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under the pretenses of safety or privacy concerns. [[gender separation in Judaism|Gender separation and segregation in Judaism]] and [[gender segregation and Islam|Islam]] reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In [[women in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Christian feminism|Christianity]], and [[women in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[monastic orders]], prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Status of Women in World Religions {{!}} PROUT Globe|url=http://www.proutglobe.org:80/2011/05/the-status-of-women-in-world-religions/|website=ProutGlobe|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320004720/http://www.proutglobe.org/2011/05/the-status-of-women-in-world-religions/|archivedate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a policy perspective, [[theocracy|theocracies]] and countries with a [[state religion]] have sometimes made sex segregation laws based partially in religious traditions. Even when not legally enforced, such traditions can be reinforced by social institutions and in turn result in sex segregation. In the [[South Asia]]n context, one institution conducive to sex segregation, sometimes but not always rooted in national law, is [[purdah]].&lt;ref&gt;Asha, S. "Narrative Discourses on Purdah in the Subcontinent." ICFAI Journal of English Studies 3, no. 2 (June 2008): 41–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Wall Entrance.jpg|thumb|A sex-segregated entrance to the [[Western Wall]], a religious site in [[Jerusalem]].]]

During the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851-64) against the [[Qing dynasty]], areas controlled by the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] had strict sex separation enforced. Even married couples were not allowed to live together until 1858.

The [[Muslim world]] and the [[Middle East]] have been particularly scrutinized by scholars analyzing sex segregation resulting from the consequences of [[Sharia]], the moral and religious code of Islam that, in the strictest version, Muslims hold to be the perfect law created by God. [[Saudi Arabia]] has been called an epicenter of sex segregation, stemming partially from its conservative [[Sunni]] Islamic practices and partially from its monarchy's legal constraints.&lt;ref name="Meiher 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meiher|first1=Roel|title=Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Gender-Segregation Debate {{!}} Middle East Policy Council|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/reform-saudi-arabia-gender-segregation-debate|website=www.mepc.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sex segregation in Saudi Arabia]] is not inherent to the country's culture, but was promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by the government, the Sahwa movement, and conservative and religious behavioral enforcers (i.e. police, government officers, etc.).&lt;ref name="Meiher 2013"/&gt; 
Israel has also been noted both for its [[women in the military by country|military draft of both sexes]] and its sex-segregated [[Mehadrin bus lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/equality-religion-and-gender-in-israel|title=Equality, Religion and Gender in Israel - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and socialization===
{{See also|Mixed-sex education#Effects of coeducation|l1=Effects of coeducation|Single-sex education#Effects of single-sex education|l2=Effects of single-sex education}}

Sex segregation is sometimes pursued through policy because it is thought to produce better educational outcomes. In some parts of the world, especially in Europe, where education is available to girls as well as boys, educational establishments were frequently single-gender. Such [[single-sex education|single-sex schools]] are still found in many countries, including but not limited to, [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotch.vic.edu.au/ |title=Scotch College |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichs.org.uk/ |title=Ilford County High School |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in particular, two federal laws give public and private entities permission to segregate based on sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; These laws permit sex segregation of contact sports, choruses, sex education, and in areas such as math and reading, within public schools.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

[[File:PS116 girls door.jpg|thumb|The girls' entrance to a school; the boys use or used an equivalent door.]]

Studies have analyzed whether [[single-sex education|single-sex]] or [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed schools]] produce better educational outcomes. Teachers and school environments tend to be more conducive to girls' learning habits and participation rates improve in single-sex schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bauch, P.A. 1988.

Critics of single-sex schools and classes claim that single-sex schooling is inherently unequal and that its physical separation contributes to gender bias on an academic and social basis. Single-sex schooling also limits the socialization between sexes that co-educational schools provide. Coeducational school settings have been shown to foster less anxiety, have happier classrooms, and enable students to participate in a simulated social environment with the tools to maneuver, network, and succeed in the world outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, R.

Segregation by specialization is also evident in higher education and actually increases with economic development of a country.&lt;ref name="WDR 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,menuPK:7778074~pagePK:7778278~piPK:7778320~theSitePK:7778063~contentMDK:22851055,00.html|title=WDR 2012 - WDR 2012 Home Page|website=econ.worldbank.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambodia]], [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Morocco]], and [[Namibia]] are countries with the least amount of gender segregation in tertiary studies while [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], Japan, and [[Lithuania]] have the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WDR 2012 - WDR 2012 Home Page|url = http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,menuPK:7778074~pagePK:7778278~piPK:7778320~theSitePK:7778063~contentMDK:22851055,00.html|website = econ.worldbank.org|accessdate = November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desegregation===

Desegregation policies often seek to prevent [[sex discrimination]], or alleviate [[occupational segregation]]. These policies encourage women and men to participate in environments typically predominated by the opposite sex. Examples include [[women in government|government quotas]], gender-specific scholarships, co-ed recreational leagues, or programming designed to change social norms.

In China, deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee proposed that the public should be more attentive to widespread instances of occupational segregation in China. Often employers reject specifically women applicants or create sex requirements in order to apply. The [[Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China]] and Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women state that no employer can refuse to employ women based on sex or raise application standards for women specifically, but also do not currently have clear sanctions for those who do segregate based on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWDF Distributes Postal Parcels to Female Sanitation Workers - All China Women's Federation|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/150514-1.htm|website=www.womenofchina.cn|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
China has also begun to encourage women in rural villages to take up positions of management in their committees. Specifically, China's Village Committee Organization Law mandates that women should make up one third or more of the members of village committees. The Dunhuang Women's Federation of Dunhuang City, in China's Gansu Province, provided training for their village's women in order to build political knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruizhen|first1=Gu|last2=Ren|first2=Qinqin|title=China to Send Another Female Astronaut to Space - All China Women's Federation|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/150548-1.htm|website=www.womenofchina.cn|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 in the European Union, a resolution was passed to invest in training and professional development for women, promote women-run businesses, and include women on company boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty has a female face: economic crisis hits women hardest {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130308IPR06303/html/Poverty-has-a-female-face-economic-crisis-hits-women-hardest|website=Europarl|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412163815/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130308IPR06303/html/Poverty-has-a-female-face-economic-crisis-hits-women-hardest|archivedate=April 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the Minister of Religious Services, Yaakov Margi Shas, has recently supported removal of signs at cemeteries segregating women and men for eulogies and funerals, prohibiting women from taking part in the services. The Minister agreed with academic and politician, Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie, who questioned him about segregation policies enacted by rabbis and burial officials, that governmental opposition to sex segregation was necessary to combat these practices not supported by Jewish or Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miskin|first1=Maayana|title=Shas Minister: Gender Segregation a Problem|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/165686#.UUc15XATv-k|website=Israel National News|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, sex segregation in one arena can be pursued to enable sex desegregation in another. For example, separation of boys and girls for early math and science education may be part of an effort to increase the representation of [[women in engineering]] or [[women in science]].

Sometimes, countries will also argue that segregation in other nations violates [[human rights]]. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces in order to secure [[women's rights in Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;Le Renard, Amélie. 2008. "'Only for Women': Women, the State and Reform in Saudi Arabia," Middle East Journal,  62(4):610–629.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes to the idea of a segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of [[Wahhabism]]. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as [[khalwa]] and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nikolas|first1=Katerina|title=Saudi Arabia orders shops to build sex segregation walls|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/342355|website=DigitalJournal|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country's first women's only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated segregated institution. Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and [[abaya]]s and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world's first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East - Creating a woman's world in Arabia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7922279.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most children, sex segregation manifests itself early in the socialization process via [[socialization|group socialization theory]], where children are expected to behave in certain sex-typed manners and form sex in and out-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Amanda J. and Karen D. Rudolph. 2006. "A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys." Psychological Bulletin 132(1):98-131.&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-school classrooms, for example, making gender more salient to children has been shown to lead to stronger gender stereotypes and intergroup biases between sex groups. These evident tendencies were also manifested in decreased playtime with children of the opposite sex, or a kind of early, selective sex segregation based on preconceived social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Hilliard, Lacey J. and Lynn S. Liben. 2010. "Differing Levels of Gender Salience in Preschool Classrooms: Effects on Children's Gender Attitudes and Intergroup Bias" Child Development (81)6:1787-1798.&lt;/ref&gt; While specifically segregating by sex for playtime has not been linked to any long-lasting effects on women's rights compared to men, these different manners of socialization often lead to communication and power struggles between men and women and to differential life decisions by each sex based on these long-established gendered identities.&lt;ref&gt;Leaper, Cambell. 1994. "Exploring the Consequences of Gender Segregation on Social Relationships." New Directions for Child Development 65:67-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary and secondary education, sex segregation sometimes yields and perpetuates gender bias in the form of treatment by teachers and peers that perpetuates traditional [[gender role]]s and sex bias, underrepresentation of girls in upper level math, science, and computer classes, fewer opportunities for girls to learn and solve problems, girls receiving less attention compared to the boys in their classes, and significantly different performance levels between boys and girls in reading and math classes. Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Sex segregation in educational settings can also lead to negative outcomes for boys such as boys in coeducational classrooms having academic scores higher than boys in single-sex classrooms. On the contrary, girls in single-sex classrooms have academic scores higher than girls in co-educational classrooms. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a [[comparative advantage|comparative disadvantage]] for either sex.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of University Women. 1998.

A special case presents with choirs and choruses, especially in the tradition of the [[choir school]] which uses ensemble and musical discipline to ground academic discipline. Male and female voices are distinctive both solo and in ensemble, and segregated singing has an evolved and established aesthetic. Male voices, unlike female voices, break in early adolescence, and accommodating this break in an educational program is challenging in a coed environment. Coeducation tends to stigmatize males, as is often the case in expressive arts, unlike athletics.

{{main article|Occupational segregation}}
Physical sex separation is not popular in many institutions on a tertiary level (between types of institutions), while fields of study or majors are highly gendered, such as later life decisions such as work/care work conflicts. Men tend to occupy engineering, manufacturing, science, and construction fields while women dominate education, humanities and arts, social sciences, business, law, and health and welfare fields.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Maria and Karen Bradley. 2002. "Equal but Separate? A Cross-National Study of Sex Segregation in Higher Education" American Sociological Review 67(4):573-599.&lt;/ref&gt; However, important life decisions as occupations can yield other instances of sex segregation by impacting [[occupational segregation|occupational sex imbalances]] and further male and female [[socialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Scotland {{!}} Action call over sex segregation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4281423.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicki Schultz (1990) indicates that although [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits sex discrimination in employment and promised working women change, "most women continue to work in low paying, low status, and traditionally female jobs." Schultz (1990) states that "employers have argued that women lack interest in male-dominated jobs, which are highly rewarded and nontraditional for women." According to Schultz, the courts have accepted this argument, subsequently not holding employers liable. Schultz contends that "the courts have failed to recognize the role of employers in shaping women's work aspirations." (Schultz, 1990:1750,1756)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"&gt;Schultz, Vicki.(1990). Telling Stories about Women and Work: Judicial Interpretations of Sex Segregation in the Workplace in Title VII Cases Raising the Lack of Interest Argument Author(s): Harvard Law Review, Vol. 103, No. 8 (Jun. 1990), pp. 1749-1843 Published&lt;/ref&gt;) Schultz states that the judicial framework that has been established by the courts "has created an unduly narrow definition of sex discrimination and an overly restrictive role for the law in dismantling sex segregation." (Schultz, 1990:1757)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Schultz concludes by saying, "courts can acknowledge their own constructive power and use it to help create a work world in which women are empowered to choose the more highly rewarded occupations that Title VII has long promised."  (Schultz, 1990:1843)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Even at psychological levels, socialized preferences for or against sex segregation can also have significant effects. In one study, women in male-dominated work settings were the most satisfied psychologically with their jobs while women in occupational settings with only 15-30% men were less satisfied due to favored treatment of the male minority in such a segregated atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Amy S. and James N. Baron. 1991. "Satisfaction? The Psychological Impact of Gender Segregation on Women at Work" The Sociological Quarterly 32(3):365-387.&lt;/ref&gt; Stark segregation by occupation can lead to a sexual division of labor, influencing the access and control men and women have over inputs and outputs required for labor. Additionally, occupational sex segregation has certain health and safety hazards for each sex, since employment conditions, type of work, and contract and domestic responsibilities vary for types of employment. In many areas of work, women tend to dominate the production line jobs while men occupy managerial and technical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools and publications - Safety and health at work - EU-OSHA|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/faq/women-and-health/what-are-the-consequences-of-gender-segregation-in-occupations|website=osha.europa.eu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of workplace factors and interactions between work and family have been cited by social stratification research as key causes for social inequality. Family roles are especially influential for predicting significant differences in earnings between married couples. Men benefit financially from family roles such as a husband and a father, while women's incomes are lowered when becoming a wife and mother.&lt;ref name="Witkowski, Kristine M 1995"&gt;Witkowski, Kristine M. and Kevin T. Leicht. 1995. "The Effects of Gender Segregation, Labor Force Participation, and Family Roles on the Earnings of Young Adult Workers." Work and Occupations 22:48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gender disparities via sex segregation between men and women include differential asset ownership, house and care work responsibilities, and agency in public and private spheres for each sex.&lt;ref name="Witkowski, Kristine M 1995"/&gt; These segregations have persisted because of governmental policy, blocked access for a sex, and/or the existence of sex-based societal gender roles and norms. Perpetuation of gender segregation, especially in economic spheres, creates market and institutional failures. For example, women often occupy jobs with flexible working environments in order to take on [[care work]] as well as job responsibilities, but since part-time, flexible hourly jobs pay less and have lower levels of benefits, large numbers of women in these lower income jobs lowers incentives to participate in the same market work as their male counterparts, perpetuating occupational gender lines in societies and within households.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt; Schultz (1990) article indicates that "working-class women have made it a priority to end job segregation for they want opportunities that enable them to support them and their families." (Schultz, 1990:1755)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Additionally, economic development in countries is positively correlated with female workers in wage employment occupations and negatively correlated with female workers in unpaid or part-time work, self-employment, or entrepreneurship, job sectors often seen occupied by women in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt; Many critics of sex segregation see globalization processes as having the potential to promote systemic equality among the sexes.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt;

{{Close relationships |types}}
'''Sexual partners''' are people who engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] together. The sexual partners can be of any number, [[sex]], [[gender]], or [[sexual orientation]]. The sexual partners may be in a [[committed relationship]], either on an exclusive basis or not, or engage in the sexual activity on a [[Casual sex|casual basis]]. They may be on [[Intimate relationship|intimate terms]] (in which case they are often referred to as "lovers") or [[Anonymity|anonymous]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art32205.html Anonymous Sex - The Body&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of sex with a stranger, a [[one-night stand]], or a [[prostitute]]. A person can be another person's sexual partner even if the sexual activity is illegal, socially taboo, or otherwise [[Infidelity|in breach of a trust or commitment]]. A person may have more than one sexual partner at any one time, either as [[polyamory]], [[polygamy]] or in contravention of convention.

The term ''sexual partner'' is usually applied to consensual sexual relations, not to those that are forced or result from duress, as in the case of [[rape]]. In those cases, one party is typically called the perpetrator, and the person against whom the sex act is imposed is called a victim, or by similar terminology.

&lt;!--[Too many quotemarks / Needs to distinguish between consensual/non-consensual?:]--&gt;A sexual partner may or may not have equal power during a sexual activity; such sexual "roles" (which can sometimes be determined by [[personality type]] but can also be determined by a conscious choice by the individual to "assume" a particular "role") typically fall under [[Dominance and submission|various dominance/submission (D/s) categories]].

==Terminology==
Generally, a sexual partner is one with whom one is engaging in a sexual activity.

An ex-sexual partner is a person with whom the other partner does not intend to engage in any further sexual activity; while a prospective sexual partner is one with whom the person has not previously engaged in any sexual activity, but desires.

'''Social history''', often called the '''new social history,''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at the lived experience of the past. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and new social history==
The older social history (before 1960) included numerous topics that were not part of the mainstream historiography of political, military, diplomatic and constitutional history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. [[People's history]] was sometimes so [[Marxism|Marxist]] that non-Marxists were alienated by it. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M.

The "new social history" exploded on the scene in the 1960s, quickly becoming one of the dominant styles of historiography in the U.S., Britain and Canada.  The French version, promulgated by the [[Annales School]], was very well organized and dominated French historiography, and influenced much of Europe and Latin America. [[Jürgen Kocka]] finds two meanings to "social history."  At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of historiography that focused on social structures and processes.  In this regard it stood in contrast to political or economic history.  The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it "Gesellschaftsgeschichte."  It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society: Business, Labor, and Bureaucracy in Modern Germany, 1800-1918'' (New York: Berghahn Books, 1999) pp 275-97, at p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the "Gesellschaftsgeschichte" movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, "social history" caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept -- and a rallying point -- of [[Historical revisionism|historiographic revisionism]]. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the little people, of the underdog, of popular movements, or of the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that "literary" evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring "background" of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a "History from the Bottom Up" that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become "a predictive social science."  I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Johnson, "Reflections: Looking Back at Social History," ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 39, Number 2, June 2011 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v039/39.2.johnson.html online at [[Project MUSE]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes ''[[Social Science History]]'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the specialty of the ''[[Journal of Social History]]'', edited since 1967 by [[Peter Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;. See [http://chnm.gmu.edu/jsh/ ''Journal of Social History'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well.

However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by [[cultural history]], which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] and Victoria Bonnell, eds., ''Beyond the Cultural Turn'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===
{{main|Historical demography}}
The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as [[social mobility]].  H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~demog/ H-DEMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of [[demography]], as in the study of the [[Demographic Transition]].

===Black history===
Black history or [[African-American history]] studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] was founded by [[Carter G. Woodson]] in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the ''[[Journal of African American History]],'' formerly the ''Journal of Negro History.'' Since 1926 it has sponsored [[Black History Month]] every February.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.asalh.org/ ASALH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic history===
[[Ethnic history]] is especially important in the U.S. and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including blacks or Native Americans). 
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies.  In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo F. Acuna, ''The Making of Chicana/o Studies: In the Trenches of Academe'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Making-Chicana-Studies-Latinidad-Transnational/dp/0813550025/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor history===
{{main|Labor history (discipline)}}
[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]], deals with labor unions and the social history of workers. See for example [[Labor history of the United States]]  The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History]].''

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price, "Histories of Labour and Labour History," ''Labour History Review,'' Dec 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 3, pp 263-270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's history===
[[Women's history]] exploded into prominence in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mtsu.edu/~kmiddlet/history/women.html American Women's History: A Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1405149604 Teresa A. Meade and Merry Wiesner-Hanks, eds. ''A Companion to Gender History'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Social history uses the approach of women's history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to "Great Women," in the past. [[Joan Kelly|Feminist women's historians]] have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by [[Joan W. Scott]] in her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W.|title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1986|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1053–1075|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1864376?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101570710027|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.2307/1864376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social historians use Scott's concept of "perceived differences" to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the [[cultural turn]], many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/skhs/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mary-louise-adams |title=DR. MARY LOUISE ADAMS, PH.D. (TORONTO) |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the family===
{{see also|History of the family}}
The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from [[genealogy]], though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influential pioneering study ''Women, Work, and Family'' (1978) was done by [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]]. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women's place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner's 2012 book and ebook, ''The Family: A World History'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt; For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds. ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'' (4 vol, 2014).

The [[history of childhood]] is a growing subfield.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, "Social History and World History: Prospects for Collaboration." ''Journal of World History'' 2007 18(1): 43-52. {{ISSN|1045-6007}} Fulltext: [[History Cooperative]] and [[Project Muse]], deals with the history of childhood worldwide. See Peter N. Stearns, ''Childhood in World History'' (2005), A.R. Colon with P. A.

===History of education===
{{main|History of education|History of education in the United States#Historiography|History of childhood care and education}}
For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] (1868-1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world.  Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes.  The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Cohen, "The history of the history of American education, 1900-1976: The uses of the past." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 46#3 (1976): 298-330. online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of [[New Left]] scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939-2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Katz|title=Reconstructing American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpeeMe6o5jIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses and never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;For a counterattack see Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Best, ed. ''Historical inquiry in education: A research agenda'' (American Educational Research Association, 1983); The most comprehensive overview of the historiography of American education, with essays by 13 scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Three fourths of British studies are institutional, says William Richardson, "British Historiography of Education in International Context at the Turn of the Century, 1996-2006," ''History of Education'', July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 569-593,&lt;/ref&gt;  but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the U.S. attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Raftery, Jane McDermid, and Gareth Elwyn Jones, "Social Change and Education in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: Historiography on Nineteenth-century Schooling," ''History of Education'', July/Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 447-463&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reeder, Schooling in the City: Educational History and the Urban Variable," ''Urban History,'' May 1992, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 23-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Herbst, "The History of Education: State of the Art at the Turn of the Century in Europe and North America," ''Paedagogica Historica'' 35, no. 3 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sanderson, "Educational and Economic History: The Good Neighbours," ''History of Education,'' July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 429-445&lt;/ref&gt;  A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, ''The Race between Education and Technology'' (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===
{{main|Urban history}}
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the U.S. It looked at the "city as process" and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major early study was [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976); Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975); and Michael P. Weber, ''Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.'' (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''Journal of Early Modern History'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural history===
{{main|Rural history}}
[[Agricultural History]] handles the economic and technological dimensions, while [[Rural history]] handles the social dimension.  Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an "orthodox" school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the "agricultural revolution."&lt;ref&gt;On British rural history see Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?"  ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481. {{ISSN|0018-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History,'' has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''The Death Rural England'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/041513885X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a "post-productivist" countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the "rural idyll."  Most rural history has focused on the [[Southern United States|American South]]—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of [[Union (American Civil War)|the North]] as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Historiography of religion}}
The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history in Europe==

===France===
{{main|Annales School}}
Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see also|Bielefeld School|Historiography of Germany}}
Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society" - ''Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' - has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] (1931-2014) and his [[Bielefeld School]] as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''[[German Studies Review]]'' 1984 7(3): 451-480. {{DOI|10.2307/1428885}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1428885 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s German historians of society, led by Wehler and [[Jürgen Kocka]] at the "Bielefeld school"  gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200. {{ISSN|1364-2529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French [[Annales School]].  After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erős Vilmos|hu}}, "In the lure of Geistesgeschichte : the theme of decline in Hungarian historiography and historical thinking in the first half of the twentieth century". ''[[European Review of History]]'' (2015) 22#3 pp 411-432. {{doi|10.1080/13507486.2014.986435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]] in 1989. [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward [[urban history]] and the conditions of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gyáni Gábor|hu}}, "Trends in contemporary Hungarian historical scholarship," ''[[Social History (journal)|Social History]],'' (2009) 34#2 pp 250-260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
When [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Communism ended]] in 1991, large parts of the [[Soviet archives]] were opened.  The historians' data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.  The old [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]],  "Impact of the Opening of Soviet Archives on Western Scholarship on Soviet Social History." ''[[Russian Review]]'' 74#3 (2015): 377-400. {{DOI|10.1111/russ.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{main|Social history of Canada}}
Social history had a "golden age" in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.  Cross, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/social-history/ "Social History,"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2008) online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Cross and Gregory S. Kealey, eds.

''Studies in Canadian Social History'' (1974). 480 pp. articles by scholars&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the "new political history," which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew W. Robertson, and David Waldstreicher, eds. ''Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Huret, "All in the Family Again? Political Historians and the Challenge of Social History," ''Journal of Policy History'', July 2009, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathi|first=Prasannan|title=The State and Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=771–778|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3parthasarathi.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[governmentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Simon|title=From Hegemony to Governmentality:  Changing Conceptions of Power in Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=705–720|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3gunn.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.
[http://www.internationalmonitoring.de/fileadmin/Downloads/Trendstudien/Trends_V2/IMO-MAG%20Howaldt_final_mit_cover.pdf "Social Innovation: Concepts, research fields and international trends"], IMO international monitoring, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

* '''Innovation in public services''' was pioneered particularly in some [[Scandinavia]]n and [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires [[healthcare]], schooling and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp Innovation in the Public Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110162352/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp |date=2006-11-10 }} an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 Ready or Not?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070618163301/http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 |date=2007-06-18 }} published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, educational institutions are now increasingly supporting teaching and research in the area of social innovation. In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.)

Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S.

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.

}}
A '''strip game''' is a [[party game]], usually involving more than one player, where a player is required to remove clothes when they lose a card hand, points in a game, or otherwise fail to come out ahead. Most [[board game]]s, [[card game]]s, [[sports]], or other games, can be adopted to create a stripping variant. A classic example is [[strip poker]], the [[Striptease|strip]] variant of [[poker]].

Strip games can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups and may be intended to generate an atmosphere of fun and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere by creating sexual excitement. Like other adult or [[Adolescence|adolescent]] party games, activities besides removing clothing and playing cards might be involved. ("[[Truth or Dare?]]" type options are often included.)

Strip games are comparable to [[drinking game]]s, in which players are required to match game losses with the drinking of a certain amount of alcohol.

==Features==
In a strip variant of a game, players, in addition to losing points according to the normal rules of the game, are also required to incrementally remove their clothing. The number of garments removed depends on the particular rules being used, but typically one piece is removed per loss or per point lost. As there are many variants of each game, the rules which will be followed on each occasion will need to be made clear, especially if there are new players. A rule which will need to be clear is when a game is to stop. For example, players can agree for the game to stop when a player is in their underwear, has only one article left or is naked or for the game to continue until only one player is left with some clothes on; and if any player can pull out if they feel uncomfortable. Other rules which will be made clear is when a player must remove clothing, as well as what constitutes "clothing" (for example, whether a pair of shoes or socks is one article or two, and whether jewelry, sunglasses or other accessories are clothing).

Generally, players will start wearing the same number of articles of clothing, though that is not necessary. It must be made clear as to what happens when a player has removed all their clothes. For example, the person may be permitted to put their clothes back on and continue playing, or the person may continue playing without clothes, until everybody has removed their clothing, or for the game to stop at that point, with the players either putting clothes back on, or remaining unclothed or semi-clothed for the rest of the evening.

Unlike their traditional variants, strip games are usually not played until the last player is removed from the game by being outscored by other players, instead players are removed from the game when they have no further garments left to take off or refuse to take off further garments.

These variations of rules are introduced in order to make game play more enticing, get more players involved, and keep guests entertained, especially during parties where alcohol is already being consumed. Unlike its traditional counterpart, the strip game becomes significantly more exciting the longer it progresses, as players are anticipating the losers to be fully or partially [[nude]], depending on the rules of the game.

As with drinking games, the strip game is usually not drawn out until the players are fully undressed or completely intoxicated, instead the players usually withdraw from the game voluntarily beforehand, depending on the degree of their personal [[Social inhibition|inhibition]]s, as well as the general social atmosphere.

==Examples==
The rules of many card and board games can be altered to produce a strip variant. Traditional casino games, such as [[blackjack]] and [[poker]], as well as games often played at [[Party|parties]], such as [[Scrabble]][http://www.alcanthang.com/poker/strip_scrabble.jpg], [[Bullshit (game)|Bullshit]], [[Speed (card game)|Speed]], [[chess]], [[Yahtzee]], [[Shithead (card game)|Shithead]], and many others can be varied to include a stripping aspect.

===Strip poker===
{{main|Strip poker}}
Strip poker is played like regular varieties of [[poker]], except that players remove an article of clothing when they lose a round. Any form of poker can be adapted to a strip form; however, it is usually played with simple variants with few betting rounds, like [[five-card draw]].

===Strip Snap===
Based on that most simple of card games "snap" where two players simultaneously place a card face up on the table. If the cards are the same they must shout "snap". The winner is the one who shouts "snap" correctly first. A player also wins if the other player incorrectly shouts snap. As with standard snap, the winner takes all cards on the table. But in this case the loser also removes an item of clothing. A player loses either when they have removed all their clothes or the other player accumulates all the cards, at which point the loser must remove the last of their clothes. 

Instead of shouting "Snap" the players can shout "strip" which some believe adds to the atmosphere. 

Usually played between couples as a form of foreplay. In groups, played between pairs with winners playing winners until only one person remains wearing clothes. In group sessions winners may re-dress between games, if that is agreed beforehand, to extend gameplay. Otherwise getting dressed is unusual, being regarded as missing the point of the game and being prudish. The final winner is expected to remove the last of their clothes upon declaration as winner. Only at that point may everybody dress, if that has been agreed before the game. Usually people remain naked or leave.

The gender mix in the group games and individual pairs is entirely a matter for the participants. In some games selecting pairs randomly from the group, or randomly within gender, such as by throwing dice, adds to the atmosphere and acts as an "ice breaker" which is the underlying purpose of the game.

===Blackjack===
Like regular [[Blackjack]], players try to get a higher card count than a dealer and not over 21. Each time a player wins a hand, the dealer takes off one article of clothing and if the dealer wins, the player/s take one off.

===Strip Scrabble===
Normal [[Scrabble]] rules apply except for the stripping rules, which can vary. For example, the players can agree to  remove an article of clothing if a player scores less than 5 points; or when another player gets a triple word score; or if a player did not score the highest score on a round.

===Music box===
This game is a variant of pass the parcel or hot potato, and involves a group of people passing around a wind-up music box.  When the music stops playing, the person holding the box must remove an item of clothing.  The box is then wound up and passed around again.

===Yakyuken===
{{main|Yakyuken}}
The same as [[rock-paper-scissors]] game. The most popular strip game in [[Japan]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} possibly even in [[East Asia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Twister===
Standard [[Twister (game)|Twister]] gameplay, with the additional penalty that every time a player falls, they must remove an article of clothing.

===Uno===
Standard [[Uno (card game)|Uno]] gameplay, Normal Uno rules apply except for the stripping rules, every time a player loses a hand, the person must remove an item of clothing.

== In popular culture ==
Stripping games also often appear as plot devices or even themes in erotic or pornographic films. One example of such a case is the 2012 film ''Strip [[Mahjong]]: Battle Royale''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strip_mahjong_battle_royale_2011/ Strip Mahjong: Battle Royale (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television game shows===
Partial or complete removal of clothing has formed a central role in numerous game shows broadcast in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the US for some years.  These include:

*''[[Everything Goes (game show)|Everything Goes]]'' &amp;ndash; (United States, 1981–1988)
*''[[Räsypokka]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[subTV]] &amp;ndash; Finland &amp;ndash; 2002)
*''[[Strip! (game show)|Strip!]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[RTL II]] &amp;ndash; Germany &amp;ndash; 1999)
*''[[Strip Poker (TV show)|Strip Poker]]'' &amp;ndash; ([[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] &amp;ndash; United States &amp;ndash; 1997)
*''[[Tutti Frutti (1990 TV series)|Tutti Frutti]]/[[Colpo Grosso (TV series)|Colpo Grosso]]'' &amp;ndash; (Germany/Italy &amp;ndash; 1990)
*''[[Dog Eat Dog (game show)|Dog Eat Dog]]'' &amp;ndash; (United Kingdom/United States) &amp;ndash; 2001&amp;ndash;2003
*''[[Pants-Off Dance-Off]]'' &amp;ndash; (United States, 2006–present)

[[File:Evpatoria red terror corpses at sea coast.jpg|thumb|Victims of ''Red Terror'' in [[Crimea]], 1918]]
'''Terror''', is from the [[French (language)|French]] ''terreur'', from [[Latin]] ''terror'' meaning "great fear", a noun derived from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] [[wiktionary:terrere|''terrere'']] meaning "to frighten",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|terror}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a policy of [[political repression]] and [[political violence|violence]] intended to subdue political opposition.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern instances of terror include [[Red Terror (disambiguation)|red terror]] or [[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]].

Before the late twentieth century, the term ''"terrorism"'' in the English language was often used interchangeably with "''terror''." Some contemporary writers use terrorism to refer to acts by groups with a limited political base or parties on the weaker side in [[asymmetric warfare]] and terror to acts by governments and [[law enforcement]] officials, usually within the legal framework of the state. Others consider state terror to be a specific type of terrorism.

==Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror==
{{Main|Revolutionary terror}}
[[Revolutionary terror]], also known as ''"[[Red terror]]"'', was often used by revolutionary governments to suppress [[counterrevolutionaries]]. The first example was the [[Reign of Terror]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy", by Barrington Moore, Edward Friedman, James C. Scott (1993) {{ISBN|0-8070-5073-3}}, p.101: "Social Consequences of  Revolutionary Terror"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/Lafayette.cov.cn.html French revolutionary terror was a gross exaggeration, say Lafayette experts. By Chandni Navalkha.] April 28, 2008. accessed 5-20-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ''[[Red Terror]]'' in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1918–1922, as well as simultaneous campaigns [[Red Terror (Hungary)|in the Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and [[Red Terror (Finland)|in Finland]]. In China [[Red Terror (China)|Red Terror]] in 1966 and 1967 started the [[Cultural revolution]]. 

Counterrevolutionary terror is usually referred to as ''"[[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]]"''. Notable examples are the terror campaigns [[First White Terror|in France]] (1794–1795), [[White Terror (Russia)|in Russia]] (1917–20), [[White Terror (Hungary)|in Hungary]] (1919–1921), and [[White Terror (Spain)|in Spain]]. Modern examples of counter-revolutionary terror include [[Operation Condor]] in South America.

==Terror and terrorism==
{{Terrorism}}
David Forte states that the primary difference between terror and [[terrorism]] is that while terror can be neutrally evil (i.e., random violence committed by [[robbers]], [[rapists]], and even [[military personnel]]), terrorism has the additional political or moral dimension, being the systematized use of randomly focused violence by organized groups against [[non-combatants]] to effect a political objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte |first1=David F.|last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Terror and Terrorism: There Is a Difference |journal=Ohio Northern University Law Review |volume=13 |issue= |pages=39–52 |publisher=Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law |doi= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/onulr13&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Charles Tilly defines "terror" as a political strategy defined as "asymmetrical deployment of threats and violence against enemies using means that fall outside the forms of political struggle routinely operating within some current regime," and therefore ranges from:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. Terror, Terrorism, Terrorists. ''Sociological Theory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, Theories of Terrorism: A Symposium (Mar., 2004), pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#intermittent actions by members of groups that are engaged in wider political struggles to
#one segment in the modus operandi of durably organized specialists in coercion, including government-employed and government-backed specialists in coercion to
#the dominant rationale for distinct, committed groups and networks of activists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tilly, the term "terror" spans across a wide range of human cruelties, from Stalin's use of executions to clandestine attacks by groups like the Basque separatists and the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and even ethnic cleansing and genocide&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Connect U.S. Fund''' ('''CUSF''') was a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based nonprofit that promotes responsible U.S. global engagement in issues like [[nuclear nonproliferation]], [[human rights]], [[climate change]], and development. It was founded in 2004 by several foundations and shut down in 2013. The organization supported grantees and other non-governmental organizations in their efforts to collaborate, engage policy makers, and bring issues to the attention of the media. Its last President was [[Nancy Soderberg]].&lt;ref name=thehill&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/120591-investments-in-climate-change-solutions-can-break-the-global-logjam "Biographical Information: Ambassador Nancy E. Soderberg"], ''The Hill'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Connect U.S. initiative was founded in 2004 by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] to unite and support a growing number of U.S.-based organizations that work on international affairs. The [[Ford Foundation]] joined the collaborative in 2005, the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]] joined in 2008, the [[Ploughshares Fund]] joined in 2009, and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] joined in 2010. The Connect U.S. Fund operated as a project of the [[Tides Center]].&lt;ref name=ConnectUS&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.connectusfund.org/about/history|website =Connect U.S. Fund|title =History|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121102085423/http://connectusfund.org/about/history|archivedate =2 November 2012|deadurl =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative had emerged from a series of meetings among the founding partners in 2002 and 2003 when they discovered that they faced similar challenges, such as "limited public and private resources for foreign policy advocacy, media focus on a narrowly defined security agenda, and the absence of informed and empowered constituencies on global issues to hold policy makers accountable". The foundations agreed that "a collaborative fund, to which each would contribute, might provide an important incentive to collaboration among NGOs, and thereby enhance the collective impact of advocacy efforts. They thus created the Connect U.S. Fund and embarked on two rounds of grantmaking, from 2004 through 2006."&lt;ref name = ConnectUS/&gt;

In November 2006, [[Eric P. Schwartz]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its first executive director.&lt;ref name=statedepartment&gt;U.S. State Department. [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/125768.htm "Biographical Information Eric P. Schwartz"], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a program of grant-making and operations designed to promote a vision of responsible U.S. global engagement during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. In early 2009, Eric Schwartz left to join the [[U.S. State Department]] as the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration]], and [[Nancy Soderberg|Ambassador Nancy Soderberg]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its new President. She served until it shut down in 2013.

==Overview ==

The Connect U.S. Fund was managed and administered by the [[Tides Center]]. The Connect U.S. Council provided policy and program guidance for the Connect U.S. initiative, and was composed of representatives from each of the supporting foundations. The Council was supported by the Connect U.S. Fund professional staff and operated as a project of the Tides Center.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;

Through a program of grant-making and operations designed to foster stronger collaboration among non-governmental organizations active on foreign policy issues, the Connect U.S. Fund sought to advance a vision for responsible U.S. global engagement in an increasingly interdependent world.  The Fund supported a community of foundations and non-governmental organizations working together to enhance the effectiveness of their collective advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Priority Issues|url=www.connectusfund.org/issues|website=Connect U.S. Fund|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607050956/http://connectusfund.org/issues|archivedate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key issues===
In 2012, the Connect U.S. Fund was focusing on four key issues:&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;
* '''[[Human rights]]''': Encourage strong American leadership in multilateral human rights instruments and institutions, including support for the work of the [[International Criminal Court]]; strengthening UN human rights mechanisms; securing ratification of at least one “core” human rights treaty; and a U.S. government structure to prevent [[genocide]] and respond to mass atrocities.
* '''[[Climate change]]''':  Urge U.S. leadership in addressing the climate crisis through making smart investments at home and in the developing world and by promoting innovative solutions for reducing emissions.  This includes eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies and galvanizing investment in adaptation, clean technology, and forest protection in the developing world.
*'''Development''':  Support for international financial and trade reform as a means for global poverty alleviation, including U.S. support for international financial transparency, international financial institution reform, trade preference reform, and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] in the developing world, ensuring U.S. civilian agencies have the funds, capacity, and knowledge needed to conduct development, stability operations, and diplomacy effectively in order to strike a better balance between the civilian and military responsibilities in these areas.
* '''Security''':  U.S. support for [[arms control]] treaties, a [[fissile material]] cut-off, and efforts to secure vulnerable nuclear materials

'''Transhistoricity''' is the quality of holding throughout human history, not merely within the frame of reference of a particular form of [[society]] at a particular stage of historical development. An entity or concept that has transhistoricity is said to be '''transhistorical'''.

Certain theories of history (e.g. that of [[Historicism#Hegelian|Hegel]]), treat human history as divided into distinct [[historical period|epoch]]s with their own internal [[logic]]s—[[historical materialism]] is the most famous case of such a theory. States of affairs which hold within one epoch may be completely absent, or carry opposite implications in another, according to these theories.

== In the abstract ==
Transhistoricity may be seen as the necessary [[antithesis]] to the idea that meanings are bounded by their historical context. It is the temporal equivalent of the spatial concept of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]].

== In sociopolitical theory ==
Questions of what might and might not be transhistorical phenomena are typically the concern of historians and sociologists identifying with the [[Historicism|historicist]] traditions of [[Hegel]]ian or [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] thought, but matter additionally in the debates around [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of [[paradigm shift]] and similar discussions. 

[[Fredric Jameson]], a [[Marxist]] or perhaps [[post-modern]] theorist, is a case in point. He famously asserted that theory must "Always historicize!", going on to wryly observe that this order was itself a "transhistorical imperative".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric (1981). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xE6vLE71yUC&amp;dq=%22the+political+unconscious%22+books&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=book-ref-page-link&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail&amp;hl=en ''The Political Unconscious'']. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others look for transhistorical continuities to inform what's basic to the human condition. For example, D. K. Simonton, finds some regularities in the types of ideas that gain ascendancy following certain types of historical events, in a data series spanning 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D. K. (1976). ''The Sociopolitical Context of Philosophical Beliefs: A Transhistorical Causal Analysis''. ''Social Forces''. vol. 54. pp. 513–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, research in the vicinity of [[Evolutionary psychology]] has proceeded on the basis that some observed transcultural regularities in human behaviour are also transhistoric, accounted for by their being fixed in the genetic legacy common to all ''Homo sapiens''.

== In aesthetics ==
Part of the debate over the distinction between [[high art]] and [[folk art]] (or lesser disciplines) hinges on the question of whether art can (and if so, if it should) aspire to transcend the particular frame of reference within which it was produced. This frame may be taken to be historically delimited.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Paul (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpMsL8f56RMC&amp;dq=transhistorical+image+philosophizing+art ''The Transhistoric Image: Philosophizing Art and Its History'']. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
