'''Advanced Placement [[History of the United States|United States History]]''' (also known as '''AP U.S. History''' or '''APUSH''') is a course and examination offered by [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==Curriculum==

The AP U.S. History course is designed to provide the same level of content and instruction that students would face in a freshman-level college survey class. AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.

===Textbooks===
Commonly used textbooks that meet the curriculum requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/html/apcourseaudit/courses/us_history_textbook_list.html |title=AP United States History: Example Textbook List |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

===Conservative criticism===
[[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] have criticized the curriculum for downplaying [[American exceptionalism]] and failing to foster patriotism. In 2014, [[2014 Jefferson County Public Schools protests|there were protests against it]] in the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County Public Schools district]] in Colorado. In 2015, a bill to replace the curriculum was passed by the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]]’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ap-us-history-controversy-becomes-a-debate-on-america-115381.html|title=AP U.S. History controversy becomes a debate on America -|last=Lerner|first=Adam B.|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Politico]]|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/23/oklahoma-legislature-targets-ap-us-history-framework-being-negative |title=Oklahoma Board of Education targets US History course for being "negative"|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
The AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts.  Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from [[Pre-Columbian era|just before European contact with Native Americans]] to the present day. Moreover, section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.

Section II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two [[Essay|essays]]. Section II, part A, is a [[document-based question]] (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. 

Each long essay essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical thinking skills: patterns of continuity and change over time, comparison, or causation. Both of the essay questions will address the same historical thinking skill. In addition, neither essay's time frame will be exclusively before 1607 (the founding of Jamestown) or after 1980 (President Reagan's election). There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm; but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.&lt;ref name="Exam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf |title=AP US History: Course and Exam Description |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide,&lt;ref name="2011 Scores"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/2011_US_History_Score_Dist.pdf |title=AP United States History Student Score Distributions Global AP Exams - May 2011 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|title=AP Data – Archived Data 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401102514/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|archive-date=2013-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.&lt;ref name="Exam"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">The '''ASPRO chronology''' is a nine-period dating system of the ancient [[Near East]] used by the [[Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée]] for [[archaeological]] sites aged between 14,000 and 5,700 BP.&lt;ref name="Hours1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Hours|title=Atlas des sites du proche orient (14000 - 5700 BP)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 July 2011|year=1994|publisher=Maison de l'Orient méditerranéen|isbn=978-2-903264-53-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASPRO : Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient|url=http://www.mom.fr/ressources-numeriques/bases-de-donnees/ASPRO|website=MAISON DE L'ORIENT ET DE LA MÉDITERRANÉE JEAN POUILLOUX|accessdate=25 September 2016|ref=MOM.FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASPRO stands for the "Atlas des sites du Proche-Orient" (Atlas of Near East archaeological sites), a French publication pioneered by [[Francis Hours]] and developed by other scholars such as [[Olivier Aurenche]].

The periods, [[archaeological culture|cultures]], features and date ranges of the original ASPRO chronology are shown below:

In 2001, the institute revised the chronology of the first six periods based on newer carbon data and calibration curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auranche | first=O | title=Proto-neolithic and Neolithic Cultures in the Middle East — the Birth of Agriculture, Livestock Raining, and Ceramics: a Calibrated 14C Chronology 12,500–5500 cal BC | journal=Radiocarbon | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=1191–1202 | year=2001 | url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/PDF/RadioCarbon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Period 3 an early and late phase could be distinguished, but Periods 4 and 5 were merged. Overall they found more overlap in time between different cultural phases between different sites.

[[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line depicted, [[Biblioteca Estense]], [[Modena]]]]

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von Lübeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Silk Road]] and [[spice trade]] routes later blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 spurring exploration to find alternative sea routes]]
[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

==Atlantic Ocean (1419–1507)==

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492–1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After they had navigated for nearly {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway. Driven away by the ''Tramontane'' or north wind, they retraced their course.

Nuno Manuel), who would serve the Spanish Crown after 1516, believed that the navigators had discovered a southern ''strait'' to west and Asia.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Ocean (1497–1513)==

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}

[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]
In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.
[[File:Namban-08.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Portuguese ''[[wiktionary:南蛮人|Nanbanjin]]'' arriving at Japan much to the surprise of locals, detail from a [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] panel of the [[Kanō school]], 1593–1600]]
Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s. Top: [[Matteo Ricci]], [[Adam Schall von Bell|Adam Schaal]] and [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] (1623–1688); Bottom: [[Xu Guangqi|Paul Siu (Xu Guangqi)]], ''Colao'' or Prime Minister of State, and his granddaughter Candide Hiu]]

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Contemporaine afb jeanne d arc.png|thumb|right|Joan of Arc drawing by Clément de Fauquembergue, 1429. The artist never saw Joan.&lt;ref&gt;Alain-Gilles Minella (2012). ''Jeanne d'Arc pour les Nuls'', First Gründ, Paris, (online French) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EDofp6mcgf4C&amp;pg=PT340&amp;lpg=PT340&amp;dq=Cl%C3%A9ment+de+Fauquembergue+n%27a+jamais+rencontr%C3%A9+Jeanne+d%27Arc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdSP-BA5g9&amp;sig=eao9FWl9apzHq6IVHUMfMz8roUc&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dGmHU_2aBcvO0AWbyYGYBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cl%C3%A9ment%20de%20Fauquembergue%20n%27a%20jamais%20rencontr%C3%A9%20Jeanne%20d%27Arc&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are a number of [[Historical revisionism|revisionist theories]] about [[Joan of Arc]]  which contradict the established account of her life. These include the theory that she was in fact guilty of the heresy for which she was condemned; that bones and other alleged relics come from her; that she escaped death at the stake and lived out her life in secret.

The following interpretations are sometimes advanced to the public but have not gained significant acceptance among academic historians.

For avowedly fictional representations of Joan in art, literature, and popular culture see [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]].

 }}
In 1819, Pierre Caze published ''La Vérité sur Jeanne d’Arc'', which argued that Joan of Arc was the illegitimate daughter of the Queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], and [[Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Duke Louis of Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caze|first1=Pierre|title=La Vérité sur Jeanne d’Arc|date=1819|location=Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caze's reasoning, the queen hid their daughter in the countryside with the d'Arc family.  When Joan of Arc met the future King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] she would have given him a private sign that she was his half sister.  It has been theorized that the coat of arms he later granted her included a sword as a [[baton sinister|baton of bastardy]].

Although this would provide an explanation for how she gained the trust of Charles VII in early 1429, this hypothesis has too many other difficulties to be taken seriously.  Foremost among them is that the duke of Orleans died on November 23, 1407.  Isabeau of Bavaria delivered a son on November 10, 1407.  The likelihood of conceiving a daughter in the interim is exceedingly small.  Assuming Joan of Arc was born the following year, she would have been 23 years old at her trial in 1431.  She estimated her own age at 19 and all but one of the 115 witnesses at the trial of rehabilitation concurred with that age.

Furthermore, if the sword in Joan of Arc's coat of arms represented a baton of bastardy, then it would be unique in heraldry; it is inconsistent with the laws of [[heraldry]] that a sword ''party per pale'' (see "Coat of Arms of Jeanne d'Arc"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/jeannedarc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) be considered a sign of illegitimacy.  It would also mean that Joan of Arc and several witnesses perjured themselves about her birth.  In the words of Regine Pernoud and Marie-Veronique Clin, "Yet amateur historians still insist that all these people – as well as Charles VII, the duke of Alençon, Dunois, Bertrand de Poulengy – carried out an intricate plot to disguise Joan's authentic royal parents.  This thesis lacks credible documentation."&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud and Clin, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival ==
Several impostors claimed to be Joan of Arc after the execution date.  The most successful was [[Claude des Armoises]].  Claude des Armoises married the knight Robert des Armoises and claimed to be Joan of Arc in 1436.  She gained the support of Joan of Arc's brothers.  She carried on the charade until 1440, gaining gifts and subsidies.  One chronicle states, "In this year there came a young girl who said she was the Maid of France and played her role so well that many were duped by her, and especially the greatest nobles."  Claude finally confessed she was a fraud after Charles VII asked her to repeat the secret which the real Joan had revealed to him when they first met at Chinon in March 1429, which Claude could not do.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses" p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern authors attempt to revive this claim by asserting that some other victim was substituted for Joan of Arc at the stake.  The likelihood of this is extremely thin, since the trial of nullification records sworn testimony from numerous witnesses who were present at the execution and confirmed her identity.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud and Clin, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. ''Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses'', pp. 228–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. Cobham Brewer|Dr. Cobham Brewer]] wrote in his nineteenth century volume ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'':

{{quote|text=M. Octave Delepierre has published a pamphlet, called Doute Historique, to deny the tradition that Joan of Arc was burnt at Rouen for sorcery. He cites a document discovered by Father Vignier in the seventeenth century, in the archives of Metz, to prove that she became the wife of Sieur des Armoise, with whom she resided at Metz, and became the mother of a family. Vignier subsequently found in the family muniment-chest the contract of marriage between "Robert des Armoise, knight, and Jeanne D’Arcy, surnamed the Maid of Orleans." In 1740 there were found in the archives of the Maison de Ville (Orléans) records of several payments to certain messengers from Joan to her brother John, bearing the dates 1435, 1436. There is also the entry of a presentation from the council of the city to the Maid, for her services at the siege (dated 1439). M. Delepierre has brought forward a host of other documents to corroborate the same fact, and show that the tale of her martyrdom was invented to throw odium on the English.&lt;ref&gt;Dr E, Cobham Brewer, ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The revisionist theory described by Brewer has been criticized on a number of grounds, including the significant number of eyewitnesses to Joan's execution, as well as the fact that Claude des Armoises subsequently confessed before a number of witnesses on multiple occasions to being an impostor.&lt;ref&gt;St. Joan Center.  Misconceptions Series: [http://www.stjoan-center.com/misconceptions/armoises_theory.html "Did Joan Survive as Claude des Armoises?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Graeme Donald argues that much of the story of Joan of Arc is a myth. He says there are no accounts or portraits of Joan of Arc's victories during her time period, nor is she mentioned as a commander of the French army by [[Georges Chastellain|Chastellain]]. He also states that the most definitive work of her life was written by [[Jules Etienne Joseph Quicherat|Jules Quicherat]] between 1841 and 1849, after he discovered a cache of documents relating to her trial. Donald argues that she was most likely not burned.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme, Donald (2009). ''Lies, damned lies, and history''. pp. 99–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have contradicted this view by pointing out that there is a wealth of information about Joan of Arc's campaigns and life from her contemporaries, including eyewitness accounts of the battles which frequently mention Joan's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Among the books which present translations of extensive excerpts from the eyewitness accounts: Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses", pp. 59–60, 70-71, 80–93, 113–19, 12–24, 130, 132–34, 138–39, 147–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were written during the campaigns themselves, such as Guy de Laval's letter on 8 June 1429.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses", pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witch==
In 1921, anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] argued that Joan was correctly identified as a witch by the religious authorities who condemned her to death, but that what they called witchcraft was in fact a survival of the pagan "old religion" of pre-Christian Europe. She claimed that Joan and [[Gilles de Rais]] were leaders of a pagan witch cult that was a rival to the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Kathleen L. (2013). ''The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology''. New York: Lexington Books, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Joan was the "incarnate God" of a cult derived from the worship of the virgin huntress [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Sullivan, ''The Interrogation of Joan of Arc''. Contributors, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray claimed that this was still the religion of most of the common people and the reason Joan inspired the ordinary soldier:

{{quote|The men-at-arms, drawn from the lower orders, followed without hesitation one whom they believed to have been sent by their God, while the whole army was commanded by Marshal Gilles de Rais, who apparently tried to belong to both religions at once.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, M., ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe'', Appendix IV, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Murray, the destruction of Joan was orchestrated by the Catholic church itself and was its first major victory against the surviving pagan cult:

{{quote|The fifteenth century marks the first great victories of the Church. Beginning with the trials in Lorraine in 1408 the Church moved triumphantly against Joan of Arc and her followers in 1431, against Gilles de Rais and his coven in 1440, against the witches of Brescia in 1457.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Alva Hoyt, ''Witchcraft'', Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Murray's views have been dismissed by later scholars as pseudo-historical fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bailey. "Witchcraft Historiography" (review) in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81–85.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian called her ideas "vapid balderdash".&lt;ref&gt;C. L'Estrange Ewen (1938) "Some Witchcraft Criticism: A Plea for the Blue Pencil".&lt;/ref&gt; Her claims about Joan of Arc were dismissed by historians based on the extensive evidence of Joan's actual religious views, such as the letters she dictated in which she defines her faith in "King Jesus, King of Heaven and of all the earth, my rightful and sovereign Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine; and Clin, Marie-Veronique. "Joan of Arc : Her Story", p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and the many eyewitness accounts of her beliefs and behavior.

== Relics and sites ==
[[Image:Jehanne signature.jpg|thumb|right|Joan of Arc dictated her letters. Three of the surviving ones are signed.]]
The Joan of Arc museum at [[Chinon]], [[France]] has a charred bone fragment reputed to belong to Joan of Arc.  Its authenticity is unconfirmed and appears to be unlikely, given the circumstances of her death. Indeed, forensic analysis has indicated that the [[Joan of Arc#Alleged relics disproven|bone is actually from an Egyptian mummy]]. The English ordered her body burned to ashes and the ashes cast into the River [[Seine]]. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] has a helmet in its Arms and Armor collection with a legendary attribution to Joan of Arc.  The museum makes no claims that this legend is true, but notes that the helmet dates from the right time period.

Several locations associated with Joan of Arc still exist, including the house where she was born, at [[Domrémy-la-Pucelle]].  The site has been converted to a museum.  The adjacent church has undergone extensive alterations since the fifteenth century but still contains a fourteenth-century statue of Saint Margaret, before which Joan of Arc probably prayed.  By contrast, the royal castle at [[Chinon]] is now a ruin.  Little more than the outer wall remains.  One wall remains of the great hall where she met [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]].

The '''American frontier''' comprises the geography, history, folklore, and cultural expression of life in the forward wave of [[United States territorial acquisitions|American expansion]] that began with [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonial settlements]] in the early 17th century and ended with the admission of the last mainland territories as states in 1912. "[[Frontier]]" refers to a contrasting region at the edge of a European–American line of settlement. American historians cover multiple frontiers but the folklore is focused primarily on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Texas]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

In 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States in the second half of the 19th century, a period sometimes called the "'''Old West'''" or the "'''Wild West'''". Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This eventually inspired the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre of film, which spilled over into [[comic books]], and children's toys, games and costumes. This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]], giving rise to the [[expansionism|expansionist]] philosophy known as "[[Manifest destiny]]".

As defined by Hine and Faragher, "frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states." They explain, "It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert V. | last=Hine |author2=John Mack Faragher | title =The American West: A New Interpretive History | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year= 2000 | page= 10 | isbn = 978-0300078350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through treaties with foreign nations and [[Native Americans in the United States|native tribes]]; political compromise; military conquest; establishment of law and order; the building of farms, ranches, and towns; the marking of trails and digging of mines; and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in his "[[Frontier Thesis]]" (1893) theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as [[individualism]], self-reliance, and even violence. Thus, Turner's Frontier Thesis proclaimed the westward frontier to be the defining process of American history.

As the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the West in fiction and film took a firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike. In David Murdoch's view, [[American exceptionalism|America is "exceptional"]] in choosing its iconic self-image: "No other nation has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America's creation of the West."&lt;ref name="murdoch"&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Murdoch | title=The American West: The Invention of a Myth | publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] | isbn= 978-0874173697 | year = 2001| page= vii | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3dFIhTAVvNQC&amp;pg=PR7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms "West" and "Frontier" ==

The [[frontier|frontier line]] was the outer line of European-American settlement. It moved steadily westward from the 1630s to the 1880s (with occasional movements north into Maine and Vermont, south into Florida, and east from California into Nevada). Turner favored the Census Bureau definition of the "frontier line" as a settlement density of two people per square mile.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Juricek, "American Usage of the Word 'Frontier' from Colonial Times to Frederick Jackson Turner", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' (1966) 110#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;10–34 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/985999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The "West" was the recently settled area near that boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Stephen, "The Making of the First American West and the Unmaking of Other Realms" in {{cite book | first=William, ed. | last= Deverell | title=A Companion to the American West | year = 2007 | pages = 5–24 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | isbn = 978-1405156530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, parts of the [[Midwest]] and [[American South]], though no longer considered "western", have a frontier heritage along with the modern western states.&lt;ref name="Lamar1977"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamar | first = Howard R. | authorlink = Howard R.

== Colonial frontier ==
{{main|Thirteen Colonies}}
[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Boone]] escorting settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]]]
In the colonial era, before 1776, the west was of high priority for settlers and politicians. The American frontier began when [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier'' (5th ed. 2001) ch.&amp;nbsp;1–7&lt;/ref&gt; English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these [[habitants]] settled in villages along the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and mid-west region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Walworth Alvord, ''The Illinois Country 1673–1818'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a larger settlement around [[New Orleans]]. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning [[patroon]]s who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.&lt;ref&gt;Sung Bok Kim, ''Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664–1775'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas in the north that were in the frontier stage by 1700 generally had poor transportation facilities, so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low. These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:
{{quote|The typical frontier society therefore was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were a number of landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Turner Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountain region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer "frontier". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.&lt;ref&gt;Main, ''Social structure of revolutionary America'' (1965) p 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From British peasants to American farmers ===

The seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farm land.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kulikoff, ''From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the good land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread. Land ownership brought a degree of independence as well as a vote for local and provincial offices. The typical New England settlements were quite compact and small—under a square mile. Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues, namely who would rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alden T. Vaughan|title=New England Frontier: Puritans and Indians, 1620–1675|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhPMfcl24XQC&amp;pg=PA213|year=1995|publisher=U. of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806127187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River valley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Harris|author2=David Lyon|title=Journey to New England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kia1OQT4YjEC&amp;pg=PA339|year=1999|publisher=Globe Pequot|page=339|isbn=9780762703302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northern New England (which was a move to the north, not the west).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Hornsby|title=British Atlantic, American Frontier: Spaces Of Power In Early Modern British America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMvXsDXvI_YC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2005|publisher=UPNE|page=129|isbn=9781584654278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wars with French and with Natives ===

Most of the frontiers experienced Native wars,&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Oatis, ''Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730'' (2004) [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Colonial_Complex.html?id=_rcFu4KjwVAC excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[French and Indian Wars]]" were ''imperial wars'' between Britain and France, with the French making up for their small colonial population base by enlisting Indian war parties as allies. The series of large wars spilling over from European wars ended in a complete victory for the British in the worldwide [[Seven Years' War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|peace treaty of 1763]], France lost practically everything, as the lands west of the Mississippi river, in addition to Florida and New Orleans, went to Spain. Otherwise lands east of the Mississippi River and what is now Canada went to Britain.

=== Steady migration to frontier lands ===

Regardless of wars Americans were moving across the Appalachians into western Pennsylvania, what is now West Virginia, and areas of the [[Ohio Country]], Kentucky and Tennessee. In the southern settlements via the [[Cumberland Gap]], their most famous leader was [[Daniel Boone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Morgan|title=Boone: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdG0WnoMcXkC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2008|publisher=Algonquin Books|pages=xiv, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young [[George Washington]] promoted settlements in West Virginia on lands awarded to him and his soldiers by the Royal government in payment for their wartime service in Virginia's militia. West of the mountains, settlements were curtailed briefly by a decree by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]. However the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] (1768) re-opened most of the western lands for frontiersmen to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Ray A. Billington, "The Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768" ''New York History'' (1944), 25#2: 182–194. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23147791 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== New nation ==

The first major movement west of the Appalachian mountains originated in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina as soon as the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] ended in 1781. Pioneers housed themselves in a rough lean-to or at most a one-room log cabin. The main food supply at first came from hunting deer, turkeys, and other abundant game.
{{quote|Clad in typical frontier garb, leather breeches, moccasins, fur cap, and hunting shirt, and girded by a belt from which hung a hunting knife and a shot pouch—all homemade—the pioneer presented a unique appearance. In a short time he opened in the woods a patch, or clearing, on which he grew corn, wheat, flax, tobacco, and other products, even fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Ambler and Festus P. Summers, ''West Virginia, the mountain state''  (1958) p 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a few years, the pioneer added hogs, sheep, and cattle, and perhaps acquired a horse. Homespun clothing replaced the animal skins. The more restless pioneers grew dissatisfied with over civilized life, and uprooted themselves again to move 50 or hundred miles (80 or 160&amp;nbsp;km) further west.

=== Land policy ===

The land policy of the new nation was conservative, paying special attention to the needs of the settled East.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Gates, "An overview of American land policy". ''Agricultural History'' (1976): pp.&amp;nbsp;213–229. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3741919 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals sought by both parties in the 1790–1820 era were to grow the economy, avoid draining away the skilled workers needed in the East, distribute the land wisely, sell it at prices that were reasonable to settlers yet high enough to pay off the national debt, clear legal titles, and create a diversified Western economy that would be closely interconnected with the settled areas with minimal risk of a breakaway movement. By the 1830s, however, the West was filling up with squatters who had no legal deed, although they may have paid money to previous settlers. The [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land. By contrast, [[Henry Clay]] was alarmed at the "lawless rabble" heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law-abiding, stable middle-class republican community. Rich southerners, meanwhile, looked for opportunities to buy high-quality land to set up slave plantations. The Free Soil movement of the 1840s called for low-cost land for free white farmers, a position enacted into law by the new Republican Party in 1862, offering free 160 acre (65 ha) [[Homestead Acts|homesteads]] to all adults, male and female, black and white, native-born or immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

After winning the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (1783), American settlers in large numbers poured into the west. In 1788, [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]] established [[Marietta, Ohio]] as the first permanent American settlement in the [[Northwest Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Roosevelt|title=The Winning of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvIxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|year=1905|publisher=Current Literature |pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, [[Daniel Boone]] blazed a trail for the [[Transylvania Company]] from Virginia through the [[Cumberland Gap]] into central Kentucky. It was later lengthened to reach the [[Falls of the Ohio]] at [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The Wilderness Road was steep and rough, and it could only be traversed on foot or horseback, but it was the best route for thousands of settlers moving into [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kincaid, ''The Wilderness road'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas they had to face Indian attacks. In 1784 alone, Indians killed over 100 travelers on the Wilderness Road.

=== Acquisition of indigenous lands ===

[[File:Death tecumseh 1813.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Indian leader [[Tecumseh]] killed in battle in 1813 by [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]], who later became Vice president]]
The [[War of 1812]] marked the final confrontation involving major British and Indian forces fighting to stop American expansion. The British war goal included the creation of an independent Indian state (under British auspices) in the Midwest. American frontier militiamen under General [[Andrew Jackson]] defeated the Creeks and opened the Southwest, while militia under Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] defeated the Indian-British alliance at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in Canada in 1813. The death in battle of the Indian leader [[Tecumseh]] dissolved the coalition of hostile Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, "Tecumseh, Harrison, and the War of 1812", ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (March 1969) 65#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;25–44 [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/imh/printable/VAA4025-065-1-a02 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, General [[Andrew Jackson]] ended the Indian military threat in the Southeast at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814 in Alabama. In general the frontiersmen battled the Indians with little help from the U.S. Army or the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch.&amp;nbsp;11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

To end the [[War of 1812]] American diplomats negotiated the [[Treaty of Ghent]], signed in 1815, with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S. territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:
{{quote|The United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain. [...] They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their own territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Gates, "The West in American Diplomacy, 1812–1815", Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1940) 26#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;499–510 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1896318 in JSTOR], quote on p.&amp;nbsp;507&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== New territories and states ===

[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West]]

As settlers poured in, the frontier districts first became territories, with an elected legislature and a governor appointed by the president. Then when population reached 100,000 the territory applied for statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Floyd Calvin Shoemaker|title=Missouri's struggle for statehood, 1804–1821|year=1916|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontiersmen typically dropped the legalistic formalities and restrictive franchise favored by eastern upper classes, and adopting more democracy and more egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Barnhart, ''Valley of Democracy: The Frontier versus the Plantation in the Ohio Valley, 1775–1818'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800 the western frontier had reached the [[Mississippi River]]. [[St. Louis, Missouri]] was the largest town on the frontier, the gateway for travel westward, and a principal trading center for Mississippi River traffic and inland commerce but remained under Spanish control until 1803.

=== The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 ===

[[Thomas Jefferson]] thought of himself as a man of the frontier and was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill D. Peterson, "Jefferson, the West, and the Enlightenment Vision", ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (Summer 1987) 70#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;270–280 [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wmh&amp;CISOPTR=36471&amp;CISOSHOW=36418 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 doubled the size of the nation at the cost of $15&amp;nbsp;million, or about $0.04 per acre (${{Inflation|US|15|1803|r=0}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars, less than 42 cents per acre).&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, ed. ''The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] opposed the expansion, but [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] hailed the opportunity to create millions of new farms to expand the domain of land-owning [[yeomen]]; the ownership would strengthen the ideal republican society, based on agriculture (not commerce), governed lightly, and promoting self-reliance and virtue, as well as form the political base for [[Jeffersonian Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Michael Curtis|title=Jefferson's Freeholders and the Politics of Ownership in the Old Dominion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSpVb1mzGgsC&amp;pg=PA9|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|pages=9–16|isbn=9781107017405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $15&amp;nbsp;million paid France for its sovereignty over the territory in terms of international law. Because of inflation, that $15&amp;nbsp;million is equivalent to about $294&amp;nbsp;million in 2012 dollars. Between 1803 and the 1870s, the federal government purchased the actual land from the Indian tribes then in possession of it. 20th century accountants and courts have calculated the value of the payments made to the Indians, which included future payments of cash, food, horses, cattle, supplies, buildings, schooling, and medical care. In cash terms, the total paid to the tribes in the area of the Louisiana Purchase amounted to about $2.6&amp;nbsp;billion in current dollars, or $8.5&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012 dollars (nearly $9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars). Additional sums were paid to the Indians living east of the Mississippi for their lands, as well as payments to Indians living in parts of the west outside the Louisiana Purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lee, "Accounting for Conquest: The Price of the Louisiana Purchase of Indian Country", ''Journal of American History'' (March 2017) 103#4 pp 921–42, Citing pp 938–39. Lee used the consumer price index to translate historic sums into 2012 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the purchase Jefferson was planning expeditions to explore and map the lands. He charged [[Lewis and Clark]] to "explore the Missouri River, and such principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean; whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable communication across the continent for the purposes of commerce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald William Meinig|title=The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History: Volume 2: Continental America, 1800–1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk-LFPFl_3YC&amp;pg=PA65|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=65|isbn=0300062907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson also instructed the expedition to study the region's native tribes (including their morals, language, and culture), weather, soil, rivers, commercial trading, and animal and plant life.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Seefeldt, et al. eds. ''Across the Continent: Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, and the Making of America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs, most notably [[John Jacob Astor]] quickly seized the opportunity and expanded fur trading operations into the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Astor's "[[Fort Astoria]]" (later Fort George), at the mouth of the Columbia River, became the first permanent white settlement in that area, although it was not profitable for Astor. He set up the American Fur Company in an attempt to break the hold that the Hudson's Bay Company monopoly had over the region. By 1820, Astor had taken over independent traders to create a profitable monopoly; he left the business as a multi-millionaire in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Jay Dolin|title=Fur, Fortune, and Empire: The Epic History of the Fur Trade in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxitJ36fsIQC&amp;pg=PA220|year=2011|publisher=W.

As the frontier moved west, [[animal trapping|trappers]] and [[Fur trade|hunters]] moved ahead of settlers, searching out new supplies of [[beaver]] and other skins for shipment to Europe. The hunters were the first Europeans in much of the Old West and they formed the first working relationships with the Native Americans in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Jay Dolan, ''Fur, Fortune, and Empire: The Epic History of the Fur Trade in America'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiram Martin Chittenden|title=The American fur trade of the far West: a history of the pioneer trading posts and early fur companies of the Missouri valley and the Rocky mountains and the overland commerce with Santa Fe ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pf8tAAAAYAAJ|year=1902|publisher=F.P. Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; They added extensive knowledge of the Northwest terrain, including the important [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] through the central Rocky Mountains. Discovered about 1812, it later became a major route for settlers to Oregon and Washington. By 1820, however, a new "brigade-rendezvous" system sent company men in "brigades" cross-country on long expeditions, bypassing many tribes. It also encouraged "free trappers" to explore new regions on their own. At the end of the gathering season, the trappers would "rendezvous" and turn in their goods for pay at river ports along the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], the Upper Missouri, and the Upper Mississippi. St. Louis was the largest of the rendezvous towns. By 1830, however, fashions changed and beaver hats were replaced by silk hats, ending the demand for expensive American furs. Thus ended the era of the [[mountain men]], trappers, and scouts such as [[Jedediah Smith]], [[Hugh Glass]], [[Davy Crockett]], [[Texas Jack Omohundro|Jack Omohundro]], and others. The trade in beaver fur virtually ceased by 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Don D. Walker, "Philosophical and Literary Implications in the Historiography of the Fur Trade", ''Western American Literature'', (1974) 9#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;79–104&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The federal government and the West ===

There was wide agreement on the need to settle the new territories quickly, but the debate polarized over the price the government should charge. The conservatives and Whigs, typified by president [[John Quincy Adams]], wanted a moderated pace that charged the newcomers enough to pay the costs of the federal government. The Democrats, however, tolerated a wild scramble for land at very low prices. The final resolution came in the Homestead Law of 1862, with a moderated pace that gave settlers 160 acres free after they worked on it for five years.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Van Atta, ''Securing the West: Politics, Public Lands, and the Fate of the Old Republic, 1785–1850'' (Johns Hopkins University Press; 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The private [[profit motive]] dominated the movement westward,&lt;ref name="Christine Bold 2013"&gt;Christine Bold, ''The Frontier Club: Popular Westerns and Cultural Power, 1880–1924'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; but the Federal Government played a supporting role in securing land through treaties and setting up territorial governments, with governors appointed by the President. The federal government first acquired western territory through treaties with other nations or native tribes. Then it sent surveyors to map and document the land.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L. Agnew, "The Government Land Surveyor as a Pioneer", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1941) 28#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;369–382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1887121 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century Washington bureaucracies managed the federal lands such as the [[General Land Office]] in the Interior department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm J. Rohrbough|title=The Land Office Business: The Settlement and Administration of American Public Lands, 1789–1837|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rwo56CSIevwC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1968|publisher=Oxford U.P.|isbn=9780195365498}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1891 the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] in the Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''The American People and the National Forests: The First Century of the U.S. Forest Service'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1900 dam building and flood control became major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, ''It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own'' (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation was a key issue and the Army (especially the Army Corps of Engineers) was given full responsibility for facilitating navigation on the rivers. The steamboat, first used on the Ohio River in 1811, made possible inexpensive travel using the river systems, especially the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;Adam I. Kane, ''The Western River Steamboat'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Army expeditions up the Missouri River in 1818–25 allowed engineers to improve the technology. For example, the Army's steamboat "Western Engineer" of 1819 combined a very shallow draft with one of the earliest stern wheels. In 1819–25, Colonel Henry Atkinson developed keelboats with hand-powered paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Roger L. Nichols, "Army Contributions to River Transportation, 1818–1825", ''Military Affairs'' (1969) 33#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;242–249 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1984483 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service|federal postal system]] played a crucial role in national expansion. It facilitated expansion into the West by creating an inexpensive, fast, convenient communication system. Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide neutral help, assisted entrepreneurs to find business opportunities, and made possible regular commercial relationships between merchants and the West and wholesalers and factories back east. The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the ''New York Weekly Tribune'', facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped integrated established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Bergmann, "Delivering a Nation through the Mail", ''Ohio Valley History'' (2008) 8#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government and private enterprise sent many explorers to the West. In 1805–6, Army lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]] (1779–1813) led a party of 20 soldiers to find the head waters of the Mississippi. He later explored the Red and Arkansas Rivers in Spanish territory, eventually reaching the [[Rio Grande]]. On his return, Pike sighted [[Pike's Peak|the peak in Colorado named after him]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul David Nelson. "Pike, Zebulon Montgomery", [http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-00787.html ''American National Biography Online'' (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Stephen Harriman Long]] (1784–1864)&lt;ref&gt;Roger L. Nichols, "Long, Stephen Harriman", [http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-00604.html ''American National Biography Online'' (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; led the Yellowstone and Missouri expeditions of 1819–1820, but his categorizing in 1823 of the [[Great Plains]] as arid and useless led to the region getting a bad reputation as the "Great American Desert", which discouraged settlement in that area for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Moring|title=Men with sand: great explorers of the North American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVxmUt3Pi9kC&amp;pg=PA108|year=1998|publisher=Globe Pequot|pages=91–110|isbn=9781560446200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, naturalists [[Thomas Nuttall]] (1786–1859) and [[John Bradbury (naturalist)|John Bradbury]] (1768–1823) traveled up the Missouri River documenting and drawing plant and animal life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Drennen Thomas, "The United States Army as the Early Patron of Naturalists in the Trans-Mississippi West, 1803–1820", ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', (1978) 56#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;171–193&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[George Catlin]] (1796–1872) painted accurate paintings of Native American culture. Swiss artist [[Karl Bodmer]] made compelling landscapes and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Hollmann, ''Five Artists of the Old West: George Catlin, Karl Bodmer, Alfred Jacob Miller, Charles M. Russell [and] Frederic Remington'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John James Audubon]] (1785–1851) is famous for classifying and painting in minute details 500 species of birds, published in ''Birds of America.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nobles, "John James Audubon, the American "Hunter-Naturalist.". ''Common-Place: The Interactive Journal of Early American Life'' (2012) 12#2 [http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-12/no-02/nobles/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of the explorers was [[John Charles Frémont]] (1813–1890), an Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He displayed a talent for exploration and a genius at self-promotion that gave him the sobriquet of "Pathmarker of the West" and led him to the presidential nomination of the new Republican Party in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Nevins|title=Fremont, pathmarker of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0Qjsavhcv4C|year=1992|publisher=University of Nebraska Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led a series of expeditions in the 1840s which answered many of the outstanding geographic questions about the little-known region. He crossed through the Rocky Mountains by five different routes, and mapped parts of Oregon and California. In 1846–7, he played a role in conquering California. In 1848–49, Frémont was assigned to locate a central route through the mountains for the proposed transcontinental railroad, but his expedition ended in near-disaster when it became lost and was trapped by heavy snow.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Wise, "Fremont's fourth expedition, 1848–1849: A reappraisal", ''Journal of the West'', (1993) 32#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;77–85&lt;/ref&gt; His reports mixed narrative of exciting adventure with scientific data, and detailed practical information for travelers. It caught the public imagination and inspired many to head west. Goetzman says it was "monumental in its breadth—a classic of exploring literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William H.

While colleges were springing up across the Northeast, there was little competition on the western frontier for [[Transylvania University]], founded in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1780. It boasted of a law school in addition to its undergraduate and a medical programs. Transylvania attracted politically ambitious young men from across the Southwest, including 50 who became United States senators, 101 representatives, 36 governors, and 34 ambassadors, as well as Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Thelin, ''A History of American Higher Education'' (2004) pp.&amp;nbsp;46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

[[File:Circuit rider illustration Eggleston.png|thumb|right|Illustration from ''The Circuit Rider: A Tale of the Heroic Age'' by [[Edward Eggleston]]; The well organized Methodists sent the [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]] to create and serve a series of churches in a geographical area.]]

The established Eastern churches were slow to meet the needs of the frontier. The Presbyterians and Congregationalists, since they depended on well-educated ministers, were shorthanded in evangelizing the frontier. They set up a [[Plan of Union of 1801]] to combine resources on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark J. |last=Englund-Krieger |title=The Presbyterian Mission Enterprise: From Heathen to Partner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Llz6CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 |date=2015 |publisher=Wipf and Stock |pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=William W. |editor-last=Sweet |title=Religion on the American Frontier: The Presbyterians, 1783–1840 |year=1933 }} Has a detailed introduction and many primary sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Most frontiersmen showed little commitment to religion until traveling evangelists began to appear and to produce "revivals". The local pioneers responded enthusiastically to these events and, in effect, evolved their own populist religions, especially during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790–1840), which featured outdoor camp meetings lasting a week or more and which introduced many people to organized religion for the first time. One of the largest and most famous camp meetings took place at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky]] in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles A. |last=Johnson |title=The Frontier Camp Meeting: Contemporary and Historical Appraisals, 1805–1840 |journal=[[Mississippi Valley Historical Review]] |year=1950 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=91–110 |jstor=1888756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The localistic Baptists set up small independent churches—Baptists abjured centralized authority; each local church was founded on the principle of independence of the local congregation. On the other hand, bishops of the well-organized, centralized Methodists assigned circuit riders to specific areas for several years at a time, then moved them to fresh territory. Several new denominations were formed, of which the largest was the [[Disciples of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter Brownlow |last=Posey |title=Frontier Mission: A History of Religion West of the Southern Appalachians to 1861 |location= |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |year=1966 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6T5LAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Dickson D., Jr. |title=And They All Sang Hallelujah: Plain Folk Camp-Meeting Religion, 1800–1845 |location= |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |year=1974 |isbn=0-87049-157-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzMxPwAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David A. |last=Varel |title=The Historiography of the Second Great Awakening and the Problem of Historical Causation, 1945–2005 |journal=Madison Historical Review |year=2014 |volume=8 |issue=4 |url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=mhr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy in the Midwest ===

Historian Mark Wyman calls Wisconsin a "palimpsest" of layer upon layer of peoples and forces, each imprinting permanent influences. He identified these layers as multiple "frontiers" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman, '' The Wisconsin Frontier'' (2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;182, 293–94&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner's last students, [[Merle Curti]] used in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, "involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant."&lt;ref&gt;Merle Curti, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959) p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;Wyman, ''The Wisconsin Frontier'', p.&amp;nbsp;293&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Southwest ===

[[File:Map of Santa Fe Trail-NPS.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Santa Fe Trail]]]]
From the 1770s to the 1830s, pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas. Most were farmers who moved in family groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' (5th ed. 1982) pp.&amp;nbsp;203–328, 747–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:

{{quote|Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....

Yet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Morton Hacker, "Western Land Hunger and the War of 1812: A Conjecture", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1924) 10#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;365–395, quote on pp.&amp;nbsp;369–71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1892931 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced a more sustainable agriculture. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] explored the individualistic world view and values of the first generation:

{{quote|What they objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve preëminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Jackson Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) p.&amp;nbsp;342.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Manifest Destiny ===
{{Main|Manifest Destiny}}

Manifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was pre-ordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. The concept was expressed during Colonial times, but the term was coined in the 1840s by a popular magazine which editorialized, "the fulfillment of our manifest destiny...to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions." As the nation grew, "Manifest destiny" became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party. In the 1840s the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841–49) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine. However the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which represented business and financial interests, stood opposed to Manifest Destiny. Whig leaders such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for deepening the society through modernization and urbanization instead of simple horizontal- expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Walker Howe|title=What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XIvPDF9ijcC|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=702–6|isbn=9780199743797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the annexation of Texas, the expansionists got the upper hand. [[John Quincy Adams]], an anti-slavery Whig, felt the Texas annexation in 1845 to be "the heaviest calamity that ever befell myself and my country".&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico and Texas ===
{{Main|History of Mexico|Texas Revolution}}
[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Houston]] accepting the surrender of Mexican general [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], 1836]]
Mexico became independent of Spain in 1821, and took over Spain's northern possessions stretching from Texas to California. Caravans began delivering goods to Mexico's Santa Fe along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], over the {{convert|870|mi|km|adj=on}} journey which took 48 days from Kansas City, Missouri (then known as Westport). Santa Fe was also the trailhead for the "El Camino Real" (the King's Highway), a trade route which carried American manufactured goods southward deep into Mexico and returned silver, furs, and mules northward (not to be confused with another "Camino Real" which connected the missions in California). A branch also ran eastward near the Gulf (also called the [[Old San Antonio Road]]). Santa Fe connected to California via the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Luther Duffus|title=The Santa Fe Trail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLjhWHWN8dYC|origyear=1930|year=1972|publisher=U.

The Spanish and Mexican governments attracted American settlers to Texas with generous terms. [[Stephen F. Austin]] became an "empresario", receiving contracts from the Mexican officials to bring in immigrants. In doing so, he also became the ''de facto'' political and military commander of the area. Tensions rose, however, after an abortive attempt to establish the independent nation of [[Fredonian Rebellion|Fredonia]] in 1826. [[William Travis]], leading the "war party", advocated for independence from Mexico, while the "peace party" led by Austin attempted to get more autonomy within the current relationship. When Mexican president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] shifted alliances and joined the conservative Centralist party, he declared himself dictator and ordered soldiers into Texas to curtail new immigration and unrest. However, immigration continued and 30,000 Anglos with 3,000 slaves were settled in Texas by 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, "Texas: The South Meets the West, The View Through African American History", ''Journal of the West'' (2005) 44#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;44–52&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, the [[Texas Revolution]] erupted. Following losses at the [[Alamo]] and [[Goliad massacre|Goliad]], the Texians won the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] to secure independence. At San Jacinto, [[Sam Houston]], commander-in-chief of the Texian Army and future [[President of the Republic of Texas]] famously shouted "Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad". The U.S. Congress declined to annex Texas, stalemated by contentious arguments over slavery and regional power. Thus, the [[Republic of Texas]] remained an independent power for nearly a decade before it was annexed as the 28th state in 1845. The government of Mexico, however, viewed Texas as a runaway province and asserted its ownership.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Davis, ''Lone Star Rising: The Revolutionary Birth of the Texas Republic'' (Free Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Mexican–American War ===
{{Main|Mexican–American War}}

Mexico refused to recognize the independence of Texas in 1836, but the U.S. and European powers did so. Mexico threatened war if Texas joined the U.S., which it did in 1845. American negotiators were turned away by a Mexican government in turmoil. When the Mexican army killed 16 American soldiers in disputed territory war was at hand. [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], such as Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]] denounced the war, but it was quite popular outside New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert W.

From the main American base at New Orleans, General [[Zachary Taylor]] led forces into northern Mexico, winning a series of battles that ensued. The U.S. Navy transported General [[Winfield Scott]] to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. He then marched his 12,000-man force west to Mexico City, winning the final battle at Chapultepec. Talk of acquiring all of Mexico fell away when the army discovered the Mexican political and cultural values were so alien to America's. As the ''Cincinnati Herald'' asked, what would the U.S. do with eight million Mexicans "with their idol worship, heathen superstition, and degraded mongrel races?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reginald Horsman|title=Race and manifest destiny: the origins of American racial anglo-saxonism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5-9jU-9J20C|year=1981|publisher=Harvard U.

The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] of 1848 ceded the territories of California and New Mexico to the United States for $18.5&amp;nbsp;million (which included the assumption of claims against Mexico by settlers). The [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853 added southern Arizona, which was needed for a railroad route to California. In all Mexico ceded half a million square miles (1.3&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and included the states-to-be of California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming, in addition to Texas. Managing the new territories and dealing with the slavery issue caused intense controversy, particularly over the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have outlawed slavery in the new territories. Congress never passed it, but rather temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in the West with the [[Compromise of 1850]]. California entered the Union in 1850 as a free state; the other areas remained territories for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse S. Reeves, "The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo", ''American Historical Review'' (1905) 10#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;309–324 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834723 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, ''The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: A Legacy of Conflict'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth of Texas ===

=== The California Gold Rush ===
{{Main|California Gold Rush}}
[[File:California Clipper 500.jpg|thumb|[[Clipper]] ships took 5 months to sail the 17,000 miles (27,000 km) from New York City to San Francisco]]
[[File:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|San Francisco harbor {{circa|1850}}. Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco exploded from 500 to 150,000.]]

In 1846 about 10,000 Californios (Hispanics) lived in California, primarily on cattle ranches in what is now the Los Angeles area. A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts, including some Americans. With the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the U.S. sent in Frémont and a [[U.S. Army]] unit, as well as naval forces, and quickly took control.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Starr, ''California: A History'' (2007) pp.&amp;nbsp;43–70&lt;/ref&gt; As the war was ending, gold was discovered in the north, and the word soon spread worldwide.

Thousands of "Forty-Niners" reached California, by sailing around South America (or taking a short-cut through disease-ridden Panama), or walked the California trail. The population soared to over 200,000 in 1852, mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco.

Housing in San Francisco was at a premium, and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the gold fields themselves living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence, drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the "mining codes" used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantism—with Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=Law in the western United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjHQWyttp6QC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=209–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who added to the population of miners, saloon keepers, gamblers, and prostitutes. A San Francisco newspaper stated, "The whole country... resounds to the sordid cry of gold! Gold! ''Gold!'' while the field is left half planted, the house half built, and everything neglected but the manufacture of shovels and pick axes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marlene Smith-Baranzini|title=A Golden State: Mining and Economic Development in Gold Rush California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPUsIaHZTm0C&amp;pg=PA186|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|pages=186–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 250,000 miners found a total of more than $200&amp;nbsp;million in gold in the five years of the California Gold Rush.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Lamar 1977, pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447"&gt;Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephy (1965), p.&amp;nbsp;251&lt;/ref&gt; As thousands arrived, however, fewer and fewer miners struck their fortune, and most ended exhausted and broke.

Violent bandits often preyed upon the miners, such as the case of [[Jonathan R. Davis]]' killing of eleven bandits single-handedly.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Fournier, Richard. "Mexican War Vet Wages Deadliest Gunfight in American History", ''VFW Magazine'' (January 2012), p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Camps spread out north and south of the [[American River]] and eastward into the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]]. In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the '49 gold rush, through 1883, [[hydraulic mining]] was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Nugent, ''American West Chronicle'' (2007) p 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to [[Dakota Territory|South Dakota]] contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became [[ghost towns]] when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest. Soon gold was discovered in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and South Dakota (by 1864).
&lt;ref&gt;Rodman W. Paul, ''Mining Frontiers of the Far West, 1848–1880'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[Comstock Lode]], containing vast amounts of silver, resulted in the Nevada boomtowns of [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], and [[Silver City, Nevada|Silver City]]. The wealth from silver, more than from gold, fueled the maturation of San Francisco in the 1860s and helped the rise of some of its wealthiest families, such as that of [[George Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Robinson|title=The Hearsts: An American Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMuc9Lb-3mkC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1991|publisher=U. of Delaware Press|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Oregon Trail ===

[[File:Wpdms nasa topo oregon trail.jpg|thumb|400,000 men, women and children traveled 2,000 miles (3,000 km) in wagon trains during a six-month journey on the [[Oregon Trail]]]]
{{Main|Oregon Trail}}

To get to the rich new lands of the West Coast, there were two options: some sailed around the southern tip of South America during a six-month voyage, but 400,000 others walked there on an overland route of more than 2,000 miles (3,000&amp;nbsp;km); their wagon trains usually left from Missouri. They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the [[Oregon Trail]]. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.&lt;ref&gt;John David Unruh,  ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840–1860'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Wagon Train of 1843", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary [[Marcus Whitman]] led the wagons on the last leg. In 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about 2,000 miles (3,000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;John David Unruh, ''The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840–1860'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward, people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward. Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west. These "gobacks" were a major source of information and excitement about the wonders and promises—and dangers and disappointments—of the far West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Unruh | first= John D., Jr. | title=Against the Grain: West to East on the Overland Trail | work=Kansas Quarterly | year=1973| volume= 5 | issue=2 |pages= 72–84}} Also chapter four of Unruh, ''The Plains Across''&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all emigrants made it to their destination. The dangers of the overland route were numerous: snakebites, wagon accidents, violence from other travelers, suicide, malnutrition, stampedes, Indian attacks, a variety of diseases ([[dysentery]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]] were among the most common), exposure, avalanches, etc. One particularly well-known example of the treacherous nature of the journey is the story of the ill-fated [[Donner Party]], which became trapped in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains during the winter of 1846–1847 in which nearly half of the 90 people traveling with the group died from starvation and exposure, and some resorted to cannibalism to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Stuckey, "The Donner Party and the Rhetoric of Westward Expansion", ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs'', (2011) 14#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;229–260 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v014/14.2.stuckey.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Another story of cannibalism featured [[Alfred Packer]] and his trek to [[Colorado]] in 1874. There were also frequent attacks from bandits and [[highwaymen]], such as the infamous [[Harpe brothers]] who patrolled the frontier routes and targeted migrant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schram|first1=Pamela J.|last2=Tibbetts|first2=Stephen G.|title=Introduction to Criminology: Why Do They Do It?|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Sage|date=2014|isbn=9781412990851|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzsXBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|last2=French|first2=John L.|title=Serial Killers|location=New York|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|date=2008|isbn=9780791094112|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mknzvz_5CiEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Missouri and Illinois, [[1838 Mormon War|animosity]] between the Mormon settlers and locals grew, which would mirror those in other states such as Utah years later. Violence finally erupted on October 24, 1838 when militias from both sides [[Battle of Crooked River|clashed]] and a [[Haun's Mill massacre|mass killing]] of Mormons in Livingston County occurred 6 days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Emily W. |last= Jensen |title= Setting the record straight on the 'Hawn's' Mill Massacre |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705384477/Setting-the-record-straight-on-the-Hawns-Mill-Massacre.html |date= May 30, 2010 |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Missouri Executive Order 44|executive order]] was filed during these conflicts, and the Mormons were forced to scatter.&lt;ref&gt;Dean L.

A hundred rural Mormon settlements sprang up in what Young called "[[State of Deseret|Deseret]]", which he ruled as a theocracy. It later became Utah Territory. Young's [[Salt Lake City]] settlement served as the hub of their network, which reached into neighboring territories as well. The communalism and advanced farming practices of the Mormons enabled them to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bert M. Fireman|title=Arizona, historic land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-gTAAAAYAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Knopf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sold goods to wagon trains passing through and came to terms with local Indian tribes because Young decided it was cheaper to feed the Indians than fight them.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence G.

The great threat to the Mormons in Utah was the U.S. government, which took ownership of Utah in 1848, and pushed by the Protestant churches, rejected theocracy and polygamy. The Republican Party swore to destroy polygamy, which it saw as an affront to religious, cultural and moral values of a modern civilization. [[Utah War|Confrontations]] verged on open warfare in the late 1850s as President Buchanan sent in troops. Although there were no military battles fought, and negotiations led to a stand down, violence still escalated and there were a number of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Robert C. |last= Kennedy |title= Setting the record straight on the 'Hawn's' Mill Massacre |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/1128.html |date= November 28, 2001 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War the federal government systematically took control of Utah away from the Mormons, and drove the church's leadership underground.&lt;ref&gt;David Prior, "Civilization, Republic, Nation: Contested Keywords, Northern Republicans, and the Forgotten Reconstruction of Mormon Utah", ''Civil War History'', (Sept 2010) 56#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;283–310, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v056/56.3.prior.html in Project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, aggressive missionary work in the U.S. and Europe brought a flood of Mormon converts to Utah. Finally in 1890 the Church leadership announced polygamy was no longer a central tenet, and a compromise was reached, with Utah becoming a state and the Mormons dividing into Republicans and Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;David Bigler, ''Forgotten Kingdom: The Mormon Theocracy in the American West, 1847–1896'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ponymap.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pony Express]] route]]
{{Main|Pony Express}}

The federal government provided subsidies for the development of mail and freight delivery, and by 1856, Congress authorized road improvements and an overland mail service to California. The new commercial wagon trains service primarily hauled freight. In 1858 John Butterfield (1801–69) established a stage service that went from Saint Louis to San Francisco in 24 days along a southern route. This route was abandoned in 1861 after Texas joined the Confederacy, in favor of stagecoach services established via [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Salt Lake City]], a 24-day journey, with [[Wells Fargo &amp; Co.]] as the foremost provider (initially using the old "Butterfield" name).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, W. Turrentine, "Wells Fargo: Symbol of the Wild West?", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1972) 3#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;179–196 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967112 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

William Russell, hoping to get a government contract for more rapid mail delivery service, started the [[Pony Express]] in 1860, cutting delivery time to ten days. He set up over 150 stations about {{convert|15|mi|km}} apart.

In 1861 Congress passed the Land-Grant Telegraph Act which financed the construction of Western Union's transcontinental telegraph lines. [[Hiram Sibley]], Western Union's head, negotiated exclusive agreements with railroads to run telegraph lines along their right-of-way. Eight years before the transcontinental railroad opened, the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] linked Omaha, Nebraska and San Francisco (and points in-between) on October 24, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. DiCerto, ''The Saga of the Pony Express'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The Pony Express ended in just 18 months because it could not compete with the telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&amp;nbsp;577–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutionally, Congress could not deal with slavery in the states but it did have jurisdiction in the western territories. California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were actually interested in Kansas, but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of [[state's rights]]. With the passage of the extremely controversial [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called "Jayhawkers" or "Free-soilers") financed the migration of politically determined settlers. But pro-slavery advocates fought back with pro-slavery settlers from Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Goodrich, ''War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854–1861'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Violence on both sides was the result; in all 56 men were killed by the time the violence abated in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Watts, "How Bloody Was Bleeding Kansas?

[http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1995summer_watts.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860 the pro-slavery forces were in control—but Kansas had only two slaves. The antislavery forces took over by 1861, as Kansas became a free state. The episode demonstrated that a democratic compromise between North and South over slavery was impossible and served to hasten the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson, ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Civil War in the West ==

=== The Trans-Mississippi theater ===
{{Main|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}

The Confederacy engaged in several important campaigns in the West. However, Kansas, a major area of conflict building up to the war, was the scene of only one battle, at [[Battle of Mine Creek|Mine Creek]]. But its proximity to Confederate lines enabled pro-Confederate guerrillas, such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]], to attack Union strongholds and massacre the residents.&lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Crouch, "A 'Fiend in Human Shape?' William Clarke Quantrill and his Biographers", ''Kansas History'' (1999) 22#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;142–156 analyzes the highly polarized historiography&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, citizens voted to join the Confederacy; anti-war Germans were hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Alan Marten|title=Texas Divided: Loyalty and Dissent in the Lone Star State, 1856–1874|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hHlg76WTGIC&amp;pg=PA115|year=1990|publisher=U. Press of Kentucky|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local troops took over the federal arsenal in San Antonio, with plans to grab the territories of northern New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and possibly California. [[Confederate Arizona]] was created by Arizona citizens who wanted protection against Apache raids after the United States Army units were moved out. The Confederacy then sets its sight to [[New Mexico Campaign|gain control]] of the New Mexico Territory. General [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]] was tasked for the campaign, and together with his [[Army of New Mexico|New Mexico Army]], marched right up the Rio Grande in an attempt to take the mineral wealth of Colorado as well as California. The First Regiment of Volunteers discovered the rebels, and they immediately warned and joined the Yankees at Fort Union. The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] soon erupted, and the Union ended the Confederate campaign and the area west of Texas remained in Union hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War in the American West''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Westphall, "The Battle of Glorieta Pass: Its Importance in the Civil War", ''New Mexico Historical Review'' (1989) 44#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;137–154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], a Union state where slavery was legal, became a battleground when the pro-secession governor, against the vote of the legislature, led troops to the [[St. Louis Arsenal|federal arsenal at St. Louis]]; he was aided by Confederate forces from Arkansas and Louisiana. However Union General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] regained St. Louis and all of Missouri for the Union. The state was the scene of numerous raids and guerrilla warfare in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Fellman|title=Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9s_37IpWF30C&amp;pg=PA95|year=1990|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peacekeeping ===

[[File:Dakota War of 1862-stereo-right.jpg|thumb|Settlers escaping the [[Dakota War of 1862]]]]
The U.S. Army after 1850 established a series of military posts across the frontier, designed to stop warfare among Indian tribes or between Indians and settlers. Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically served built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement. Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Watson, ''Peacekeepers and Conquerors: The Army Officer Corps on the American Frontier, 1821–1846'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic conflict was the [[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux war in Minnesota]] in 1862, when Dakota tribes systematically attacked German farms in an effort to drive out the settlers. Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], slaughtered 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at [[Battle of Fort Ridgely|Fort Ridgely]], [[Battle of Birch Coulee|Birch Coulee]], [[Fort Abercrombie]], and [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]] punctuated a six-week war, which ended in American victory. The federal government tried 425 Indians for murder, and 303 were convicted and sentenced to death. Lincoln pardoned the majority, but 38 leaders were hanged .&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Carley, ''The Dakota War of 1862'' (Minnesota Historical Society, 2nd ed. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The decreased presence of Union troops in the West left behind untrained militias; hostile tribes used the opportunity to attack settlers. The militia struck back hard, most notably by attacking the winter quarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians, filled with women and children, at the [[Sand Creek massacre]] in eastern Colorado in late 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Hoig, ''The Sand Creek Massacre'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kit Carson]] and the U.S. Army in 1864 trapped the entire [[Navajo people|Navajo tribe]] in New Mexico, where they had been raiding settlers, and put them on a reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Hopkins, "Kit Carson and the Navajo Expedition", ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'' (1968) 18#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;52–61&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Indian Territory]], now Oklahoma, conflicts arose among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], most of which sided with the South being slaveholders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;W. David Baird and Danney Goble, ''Oklahoma: A History'' (2011) pp.&amp;nbsp;105–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Congress enacted two major laws to facilitate settlement of the West: the [[Homestead Act]] and the [[Pacific Railroad Act]]. The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.

== The Postbellum West ==

=== Territorial governance after the Civil War ===

[[File:Fsstockade.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Supply|Camp Supply]] Stockade, February 1869]]

With the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much "red tape", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Ericson Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires: Governors and Territorial Government, 1784–1912'' (U. of Pittsburgh Press 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;177&lt;/ref&gt;

Territorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.&lt;ref&gt;Eblen, ''The First and Second United States Empires'' p.&amp;nbsp;190&lt;/ref&gt;

These improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering. As [[Mark Twain]] wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, "The government of my country snubs honest simplicity, but fondles artistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Twain|title=Roughing it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAZEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA181|year=1913|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Territorial rings", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Indian tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Phillips|author2=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MNXAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federal land system ===

[[File:Homesteader NE 1866.png|thumb|[[Homestead Acts|Homesteaders]] [[circa|c.]] 1866]]

In acquiring, preparing, and distributing public land to private ownership, the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the [[Land Ordinance of 1785|Land Ordinance]] of 1785. Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at [[public auction]]. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of "land script". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vernon Webster Johnson|author2=Raleigh Barlowe|title=Land Problems and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoHUQQFXzKAC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed "claims clubs" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The Iowa Claim Clubs: Symbol and Substance", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1958) 45#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;231–253 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902928 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system. The [[Homestead Act]] granted {{convert|160|acre|km2}} free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women, were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.&lt;ref&gt;Harold M. Hyman, ''American Singularity: The 1787 Northwest Ordinance, the 1862 Homestead and Morrill Acts, and the 1944 GI Bill'' (U of Georgia Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah T. Phillips et al. "Reflections on One Hundred and Fifty Years of the United States Department of Agriculture", ''Agricultural History'' (2013) 87#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;314–367.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 provided for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad. The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt E. Kinbacher, and William G. Thoms III, "Shaping Nebraska", ''Great Plains Quarterly'' (2008) 28#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;191–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 provided land grants to states to begin colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts (engineering). Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in 1890. The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming more scientific and profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Wishart, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&amp;pg=PA204|year=2004|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcontinental railroads ===
{{main|First Transcontinental Railroad|History of the Union Pacific Railroad}}
[[File:Pacific Railroad Profile 1867.jpg|upright=2.75|thumb|center|Profile of the Pacific Railroad from San Francisco (left) to Omaha. ''Harper's Weekly'' December 7, 1867]]

In the 1850s government sponsored surveys to chart the remaining unexplored regions of the West, and to plan possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. Much of this work was undertaking by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]], and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as "The Great Reconnaissance". Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern, central or southern route. Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, and as nearly-level route as possible, given the weak locomotives of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Schubert, ''The Nation Builders: A Sesquicentennial History of the Corps of Topographical Engineers 1838–1863'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transcontinental railroad route.png|thumb|left|Route of the first transcontinental railroad across the western United States.]]

In the 1850s, proposals to build a transcontinental failed because of Congressional disputes over slavery. With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. [[Theodore Judah]], the chief engineer of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 [[Pacific Railroad Act]], which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the [[History of the Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] (which built west from Omaha).&lt;ref&gt;David Haward Bain, ''[[Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad]]'' New York: Penguin Books (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants ([[Leland Stanford]], [[Collis Huntington]], [[Charles Crocker]], and [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]]) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.

The road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money—later repaid—at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.

Most of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Saxton]], "The Army of Canton in the High Sierra", ''Pacific Historical Review'' (1966) 35#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;141–152 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3636678 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus shows how these men lived and worked, and how they managed their money. He concludes that senior officials quickly realized the high degree of cleanliness and reliability of the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;George Kraus, "Chinese Laborers and the Construction of the Central Pacific", ''Utah Historical Quarterly'' (1969) 27#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;41–57&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Pacific employed over 12,000 Chinese workers, 90% of its manual work force. Ong explores whether or not the [[Chinese Railroad Workers]] were exploited by the railroad, with whites in the better positions. He finds the railroad set different wage rates for whites and Chinese and used the latter in the more menial and dangerous jobs, such as the handling and the pouring of [[Nitro glycerin|nitroglycerin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-nitro/|title=PBS: Role of Nitro Glycerin in the Transcontinental Railroad}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the railroad also provided camps and food the Chinese wanted and protected the Chinese workers from threats from whites.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Ong, "The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor", ''Journal of Ethnic Studies'' (1985) 13#2w pp.&amp;nbsp;119–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Union pacific poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Poster for the Union Pacific Railroad's opening-day, 1869.]]

Building the railroad required six main activities: surveying the route, blasting a right of way, building tunnels and bridges, clearing and laying the roadbed, laying the ties and rails, and maintaining and supplying the crews with food and tools. The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later) and weighed {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}}. and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder. The Union Pacific construction crews, mostly Irish Americans, averaged about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of new track per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Edwin Legrand Sabin]]|title=Building the Pacific railway: the construction-story of America's first iron thoroughfare between the Missouri river and California, from the inception of the great idea to the day, May 10, 1869, when the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific joined tracks at Promotory point, Utah, to form the nation's transcontinental|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXO6x1nSldYC&amp;pg=PA13|year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six transcontinental railroads were built in the [[Gilded Age]] (plus two in Canada); they opened up the West to farmers and ranchers. From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, [[Milwaukee Road]], and [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]] along the Canada–US border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]], and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of [[James J. Hill]] relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier [[Jay Cooke]] (1821–1905) was in charge until 1873, when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] (1835–1900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1893]] and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from [[J.P. Morgan]], but President Theodore Roosevelt [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|broke them up in 1904]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross R. Cotroneo, "The Northern Pacific: Years of Difficulty", ''Kansas Quarterly'' (1970) 2#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;69–77&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of operation, 1869–70, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had "Immigration Bureaus" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because "settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber".&lt;ref&gt;Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' pp.&amp;nbsp;646–7&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gordon, ''Passage to Union: How the Railroads Transformed American Life, 1829–1929'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

White concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east–west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration after the Civil War ===

[[File:Picturesque America58.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1872, shows settlers crossing the [[Great Plains]]. By [[F.O.C. Darley]] and engraved by [[Henry Bryan Hall|H.B. Hall]].]]
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising "the Best Prairie Lands", "Low Prices", "Large Discounts For Cash", and "Better Terms Than Ever!". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Billington and Ridge, ''Westward Expansion'' ch 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to faced challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and fearsome tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/ourstory/activities/sodhouse/more.html|title=Life on the Prairie |publisher=American History |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses.

==== Oklahoma Land Rush ====
{{Main|Land Rush of 1889}}

In 1889, Washington opened {{convert|2000000|acre|km2}} of unoccupied lands in the Oklahoma territory. On April 22, over 100,000 settlers and cattlemen (known as "boomers")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soonersports.com/trads/what-is-a-sooner.html ''What is a Sooner.''] SoonerAthletics. University of Oklahoma.

A witness wrote, "The horsemen had the best of it from the start. It was a fine race for a few minutes, but soon the riders began to spread out like a fan, and by the time they reached the horizon they were scattered about as far as the eye could see".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Larry Schweikart]] and Bradley J.

In the same manner, millions of acres of additional land was opened up and settled in the following four years.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Hoig, ''The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alaska Purchase ===
{{Main|Alaska Purchase}}
Fearful of takeover of [[Alaska]] (then [[Russian America]]) from the British Army based in [[British North America]] and due to lack of economic interests, the [[Russian Empire]], which had established a presence in Alaska in the mid-18th century, was eager to get rid of the territory. They first approached the United States about selling the territory in the late 1850s, but negotiations were stalled by the outbreak of the Civil War. After 1865, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Seward]], a supporter of territorial expansion, was eager to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2 million ($118 million in today's dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] on October 18 of that same year where Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.

Critics at the time decried the purchase as "Seward's Folly", reasoning that there was no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slow, the discovery of gold fields during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1896 and [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1898 brought thousands of migrants and immigrants into the territory, thus propelling Alaska's prosperity for decades to come. Alaska is later known as "America's Last Frontier", as the U.S. completed westward in the North American continent.

{{Main|American Indian Wars}}

Indian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi. The [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]] (1894) provided an estimate of deaths:
{{quote|The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bureau of the Census|title=Report on Indians taxed and Indians not taxed in the United States (except Alaska)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWkUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637|year=1894|page=637|isbn=9780883544624}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Russell Thornton estimates that from 1800 to 1890, the Indian population declined from 600,000 to as few as 250,000. The depopulation was principally caused by disease as well as warfare. Many tribes in Texas, such as the [[Karankawa people|Karankawan]], [[Akokisa]], Bidui and others, were extinguished due to conflicts with settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell Thornton|title=American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492|url=|year=1990|page=131,132}} University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|978-0806122205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid depopulation of the American Indians after the Civil War alarmed the U.S. Government, and the [[James Rood Doolittle#U.S. Senator|Doolittle Committee]] was formed to investigate the causes as well recommendations to save the population.&lt;ref&gt;"DOOLITTLE AND THE INDIANS.; What the Senator Knows About Suppressing Reports A Good Secretary of the Interior for Greeley's Reform Cabinet", ''The New York Times'', September 8, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell Thornton|title=American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492|url=|year=1990|pages=132–133}} University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|978-0806122205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions presented by the committee, such as the establishment of the five boards of inspection to prevent Indian abuses, had little effect as large Western migration commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2012/01/jf-ptak-science-books-post-1706-the-indian-had-few-options-in-the-1860s-and-1870s-the-buffalo-were-gone-and-hunting-lands-w.html |title=The Doolittle Report on the State of Indians in U.S. Reservations, 1867 |publisher=Long Street |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian wars east of the Mississippi ===

==== The Trail of Tears ====
{{Main|Trail of tears}}

The expansion of migration into the Southeastern United States in the 1820s to the 1830s forced the federal government to deal with the "Indian question". The Indians were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of President [[Andrew Jackson]] demanded removal of the Indians out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The [[Jacksonian Democracy]] proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832 and 1836. By 1837 the "Indian Removal policy" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;However Jackson's policy is defended as benign by Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2001) pp.&amp;nbsp;226–53, and by Francis Paul Prucha, "Andrew Jackson's Indian Policy: A Reassessment", ''Journal of American History'' (1969) 56:527–39 {{JSTOR|1904204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Indians, but in reality the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred A. Cave, "Abuse of Power: Andrew Jackson and The Indian Removal Act of 1830", ''Historian'', (Winter 2003) 65#6 pp.&amp;nbsp;1330–1353 {{DOI|10.1111/j.0018-2370.2003.00055.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson justified his actions by stating that Indians had "neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of improvements".&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;86–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The forced march of about twenty tribes included the "Five Civilized Tribes" ([[Creek people|Creek]], [[Choctaw]], [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], and [[Seminole]]). To motivate natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Indian nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the "[[Indian Territory]]" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, William M., ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', Random House (2001) Chapter 7: Atrocities from the Trail of Tears to the Civil War. {{ISBN|978-0375758560}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exodus has become known as [[The Trail of Tears]] (in Cherokee "''Nunna dual Tsuny''", "The Trail Where they Cried"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.&lt;ref&gt;Theda Perdue, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2008) ch.&amp;nbsp;6, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The only way for an Indian to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many natives who took the offer were defrauded by "ravenous speculators" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached {{convert|3800000|acre|km2}}. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Mahon, ''History of the Second Seminole War, 1835–1842'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian wars west of the Mississippi ===

[[File:Western Indian Wars.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''Indian battles in the [[Trans-Mississippi|Trans Mississippi]] West'''&lt;/center&gt;]]

Indian warriors in the West, using their traditional style of limited, battle-oriented warfare, confronted the U.S. Army. The Indians emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the "modern" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. McGinnis, "When Courage Was Not Enough: Plains Indians at War with the United States Army", ''Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;455–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the [[Apache]]. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Michno, ''Encyclopedia of Indian wars: western battles and skirmishes, 1850–1890'' p.&amp;nbsp;367&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the [[Snake War]] in 1864–1868, which was conducted by a confederacy of [[Northern Paiute]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]] and [[Shoshone]] Native Americans, called the "Snake Indians" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848–1888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;462, note&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the [[Snake River]] Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Michno, Gregory, ''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864–1868''. Caldwell: Caxton Press, 2007. pp.&amp;nbsp;345–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Colorado War]] fought by [[Cheyenne]], Arapaho and Sioux, was fought in the territories of Colorado to Nebraska. The conflict was fought in 1863–1865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Indian women and children such as the bloody [[Sand Creek massacre]], and the Indians also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the [[American Ranch massacre]] and [[Raid on Godfrey Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, George E.

In the [[Apache Wars]], Colonel [[Kit Carson|Christopher "Kit" Carson]] forced the [[Mescalero]] Apache onto a reservation in 1862. In 1863–1864, Carson used a [[scorched earth]] policy in the [[Navajo Wars|Navajo Campaign]], burning Navajo fields and homes, and capturing or killing their livestock. He was aided by other Indian tribes with long-standing enmity toward the Navajos, chiefly the [[Ute Tribe|Utes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edwin Legrand|last=Sabin|title=Kit Carson days (1809–1868)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA409|year=1914|publisher=A. C. McClurg |pages=409–17}}, full text online&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent conflict of this war was [[Geronimo]]'s fight against settlements in Texas in the 1880s. The Apaches under his command conducted ambushes on US cavalries and forts, such as their [[Battle of Cibecue Creek|attack on Cibecue Creek]], while also raiding upon prominent farms and ranches, such as their infamous attack on the [[Empire Ranch]] that killed three cowboys.&lt;ref name="Chiefs"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capps | first = Benjamin | title = The Great Chiefs| publisher=Time-Life Education| year = 1975| page = 240| isbn = 978-0-316-84785-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Empire Ranch Foundation: History of the Empire Ranch| work=Gregory Paul Dowell| url=http://www.empireranchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dowell-Thesis-Converted.pdf| accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. finally induced the last hostile Apache band under [[Geronimo]] to surrender in 1886.

During the [[Comanche Campaign]], the [[Red River War]] was fought in 1874–75 in response to the Comanche's dwindling food supply of buffalo, as well as the refusal of a few bands to be inducted in reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel C.

The war finally ended with a final confrontation between the Comanches and the U.S. Cavalry in [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon|Palo Duro Canyon]].

[[Red Cloud's War]] was led by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] chief [[Red Cloud]] against the military who were erecting forts along the Bozeman trail. It was the most successful campaign against the U.S. during the Indian Wars. By the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]], the U.S. granted a large reservation to the Lakota, without military presence; it included the entire Black Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Spencer C.|last=Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyNakUZmQ9IC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=287|isbn=9781851096039}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]] was a chief of the Native American [[Modoc people|Modoc]] tribe of California and [[Oregon]], and was their leader during the [[Modoc War]].

[[File:Fetterman massacre.jpg|thumb|The battle near [[Fort Phil Kearny]], Dakota Territory, December 21, 1866]]
In June 1877, in the [[Nez Perce War]] the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] under [[Chief Joseph]], unwilling to give up their traditional lands and move to a reservation, undertook a 1,200-mile (2,000&amp;nbsp;km) fighting retreat from [[Oregon]] to near the Canada–US border in [[Montana]]. Numbering only 200 warriors, the Nez Perce "battled some 2,000 American regulars and volunteers of different military units, together with their Indian auxiliaries of many tribes, in a total of eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes."&lt;ref&gt;Alvin M. Jacoby, Jr., ''The Nez Perce and the Opening of the Northwest.'' (Yale U Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;632&lt;/ref&gt; The Nez Perce were finally surrounded at the [[Battle of Bear Paw]] and surrendered. The [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] was conducted by the Lakota under [[Sitting Bull]] and [[Crazy Horse]]. The conflict began after repeated violations of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] once gold was discovered in the hills. One of its famous battles was the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], in which combined [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]] forces defeated the 7th Cavalry, led by General [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Spencer C.|last=Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyNakUZmQ9IC&amp;pg=PA222|year= 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781851096039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ute War]], fought by the [[Ute people]] against settlers in Utah and Colorado, led to two battles; the [[Meeker massacre]] which killed 11 Indian agents, and the Pinhook massacre which killed 13 armed ranchers and cowboys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/library/2012/10/15/meeker-massacre-forced-utes-colorado-attack-backlash/4274/|title=Meeker Massacre forced Utes from most of Colorado, but the attack was a backlash |last=Bunch |first=Joey |work=The Denver Post |date=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gjsentinel.com/special_sections/articles/deadly_confrontation_in_utah_t |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150404112855/http://www.gjsentinel.com/special_sections/articles/deadly_confrontation_in_utah_t |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 4, 2015 |title=Deadly confrontation in Utah took place shortly before GJ incorporated |last=Jordan |first=Kathy |work=The Daily Sentinel |date=January 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ute conflicts finally ended after the events of the [[Bluff War]].

The end of the Indian wars came at the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] on December 29, 1890 where the [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] attempted to disarm a Sioux man and precipitated an engagement in which about 150 Sioux men, women, and children were killed.

=== Forts and outposts ===

As the frontier moved westward, the establishment of U.S. military forts moved with it, representing and maintaining federal sovereignty over new territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert Walter|last=Frazer|title=Forts of the West: Military Forts and Presidios, and Posts Commonly Called Forts, West of the Mississippi River to 1898|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GNSjwUnkmoC|year=1965|publisher=U. of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806112503}} for detailed guide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Warren A.|last1=Beck|first2=Ynez D.|last2=Haase|title=Historical Atlas of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8F1eGSL6_lwC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1992|publisher=U of Oklahoma Press|pages=36 for map|isbn=9780806124568}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military garrisons usually lacked defensible walls but were seldom attacked. They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas, particularly for counteracting the Indian presence. For example, [[Fort Bowie]] protected [[Apache Pass]] in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against [[Cochise]] and [[Geronimo]]. [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Kearny]] helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]], Arkansas, [[Fort Snelling]], Minnesota, [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico, [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and [[Fort Walla Walla]] in Washington. [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska was home to the [[Department of the Platte]], and was responsible for outfitting most Western posts for more than 20 years after its founding in the late 1870s. [[Fort Huachuca]] in Arizona was also originally a frontier post and is still in use by the United States Army.

Settlers on their way overland to Oregon and California became targets of Indian threats. Robert L. Munkres read 66 diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between 1834 and 1860 to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Indian attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming. The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Indians who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Munkres, "The Plains Indian Threat on the Oregon Trail before 1860", ''Annals of Wyoming'' (April 1968) 40#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;193–221&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen reports that the Shoshoni and Bannock tribes north and west of Utah were more aggressive toward wagon trains.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham D. Madsen, "Shoshoni-Bannock Marauders on the Oregon Trail, 1859–1863", ''Utah Historical Quarterly'', (Jan 1967) 35#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–30&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government attempted to reduce tensions and create new tribal boundaries in the Great Plains with two new treaties in the early 1850, The [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] established tribal zones for the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyennes]], [[Arapahos]], [[Crow Nation|Crows]], and others, and allowed for the building of roads and posts across the tribal lands. A second treaty secured safe passage along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual compensation for damages caused by migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Burton S. Hill, "The Great Indian Treaty Council of 1851", ''Nebraska History'', (1966) 47#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;85–110&lt;/ref&gt; The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the [[Mormons]] also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.

A new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the "Indian Territory" began to be ignored. In providing for Indian reservations, Congress and the [[Office of Indian Affairs]] hoped to de-tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society, the "ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis Paul|last=Prucha|title=The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSeWGTYsFcsC&amp;pg=PA324|year=1995|publisher=U. of Nebraska Press|page=324|isbn=0803287348}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the [[Missouri River]] in the new [[Nebraska Territory]], which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. Influential pioneer towns included [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] and [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]].

American attitudes towards Indians during this period ranged from malevolence ("the only good Indian is a dead Indian") to misdirected humanitarianism (Indians live in "inferior" societies and by assimilation into white society they can be redeemed) to somewhat realistic (Native Americans and settlers could co-exist in separate but equal societies, dividing up the remaining western land).&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;321&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing with nomadic tribes complicated the reservation strategy and decentralized tribal power made treaty making difficult among the Plains Indians. Conflicts erupted in the 1850s, resulting in various Indian wars.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;95&lt;/ref&gt; In these times of conflict, Indians become more stringent about white men entering their territory. Such as in the case of [[Oliver Loving]], they would sometimes attack [[cowboy]]s and their cattle if ever caught crossing in the borders of their land.&lt;ref name="richardmelzer"&gt;Richard Melzer, ''Buried Treasures: Famous and Unusual Gravesites in New Mexico History'', Santa Fe, New Mexico: Sunstone Press, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;105 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UxiTZmoAAKgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=%22oliver+loving%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22oliver%20loving%22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarah"&gt;Carter, Sarah, ''Cowboys, Ranchers and the Cattle Business: Cross-Border Perspectives on Ranching History'', Univ Pr of Colorado (2000) p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; They would also prey upon livestock if food was scarce during hard times.

After the Civil War, as the volunteer armies disbanded, the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten, among them Custer's [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] of [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] fame, and the African-American [[U.S. 9th Cavalry Regiment]] and [[U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment]]. The black units, along with others (both cavalry and infantry), collectively became known as the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. According to [[Robert M. Utley]]:
{{quote|The frontier army was a conventional military force trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like conventional enemies and, indeed, quite often were not enemies at all.

== Social history ==

=== Democratic society ===

[[File:Mayer-Awakening-1915.jpg|thumb|left|"The Awakening" [[Women's suffrage|Suffragists]] were successful in the West; their torch awakens the women struggling in the East and South in this cartoon by [[Henry "Hy" Mayer|Hy Mayer]] in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' February 20, 1915]]

Westerners were proud of their leadership in the movement for democracy and equality, a major theme for [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]. The new states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Ohio were more democratic than the parent states back East in terms of politics and society.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington, ''America's Frontier Heritage' (1963) ch.&amp;nbsp;6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The Western states were the first to give women the right to vote. By 1900 the West, especially California and Oregon, led the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]].

Scholars have examined the social history of the west in search of the American character. The [[history of Kansas]], argued historian [[Carl L. Becker]] a century ago, reflects American ideals. He wrote: "The Kansas spirit is the American spirit double distilled. It is a new grafted product of American individualism, American idealism, American intolerance. Kansas is America in microcosm."&lt;ref&gt;Carl L. Becker, "Kansas", in ''Essays in American History Dedicated to Frederick Jackson Turner'' (1910), 85–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have compared the emergence of democracy in America with other countries, with reference to the frontier experience.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D. Wyman, and Clifton B. Kroeber, eds. ''The frontier in perspective'' (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; Selwyn Troen has made the comparison with Israel. The American frontiersmen relied on individual effort, in the context of very large quantities of unsettled land with weak external enemies. Israel by contrast, operated in a very small geographical zone, surrounded by more powerful neighbors. The Jewish pioneer was not building an individual or family enterprise, but was a conscious participant in nation building, with a high priority on collective and cooperative planned settlements. The Israeli pioneers brought in American experts on irrigation and agriculture to provide technical advice. However they rejected the American frontier model in favor of a European model that supported their political and security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ilan Troen,  "Frontier myths and their applications in America and Israel: A transnational perspective". ''Journal of American History'' 86#3 (1999): 1209–1230.

=== Urban frontier ===

The cities played an essential role in the development of the frontier, as transportation hubs, financial and communications centers, and providers of merchandise, services, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, ''The Urban Frontier: The Rise of Western Cities, 1790–1830'' (1959) [https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Frontier-Western-Cities-1790-1830/dp/0252064224/ excerpt and text search], covers Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville and St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt; As the railroads pushed westward into unsettled territory after 1860, they build service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hudson, "Towns of the western railroads". ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 2#1 (1982): 41–54. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=greatplainsquarterly online]&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this pattern held for Texas as well, so railroads did not arrive until the 1880s. They then shipped the cattle out and cattle drives became short-distance affairs. However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Holden, "Law and Lawlessness on the Texas Frontier, 1875–1890". ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 44.2 (1940): 188–203. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30240564 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Denver Colorado 1898 - LOC - restoration1.jpg|783px|Panorama of [[Denver]] circa 1898.}}

Denver's economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40&amp;nbsp;million, and population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Leonard, and Thomas J. Noel, ''Denver: Mining Camp to Metropolis'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab12.txt|title=Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid "cribs" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and "crib girls" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Secrest. ''Hell's Belles: Prostitution, Vice, and Crime in Early Denver, with a Biography of Sam Howe, Frontier Lawman.'' (2nd ed., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

With its giant mountain of copper, [[Butte, Montana]] was the largest, richest and rowdiest mining camp on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation [[Anaconda Copper]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Emmons, ''The Butte Irish: class and ethnicity in an American mining town, 1875–1925'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, "an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling". It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners that Butte was a cultivated city.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Ring, "The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana", ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' (1993) 28#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;430–44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25542594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===

==== European immigrants ====

[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|Temporary quarters for [[Volga Germans]] in central [[Kansas]], 1875]]

European immigrants often built communities of similar religious and ethnic backgrounds. For example, many [[Finnish American|Finns]] went to Minnesota and Michigan, [[Swedish American|Swedes]] and [[Norwegian American|Norwegians]] to Minnesota and the Dakotas, [[Irish American|Irish]] to railroad centers along the transcontinental lines, [[Volga Germans]] to North Dakota, and [[German Jews]] to Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Luebke, ''European Immigrants in the American West: Community Histories''(1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman, ''Immigrants in the Valley: Irish, Germans and Americans in the Upper Mississippi Country, 1830–1860'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== African-Americans ====

[[File:Army buffalo soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Buffalo Soldier]]. The nickname was given to the Black soldiers by the Indian tribes they controlled.]]
African Americans moved West as soldiers, as well as cowboys, farm hands, saloon workers, cooks, and outlaws. The [[Buffalo Soldiers]] were soldiers in the all-black 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, and 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments of the U.S. Army. They had white officers and served in numerous western forts.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Leckie and Shirley A. Leckie. ''The Buffalo Soldiers: A Narrative of the Black Cavalry in the West'' (U. of Oklahoma Press, 2012)
&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4,000 blacks came to California in Gold Rush days. In 1879, after the end of Reconstruction in the South, several thousand Freedmen moved from Southern states to Kansas. Known as the [[Exoduster]]s, they were lured by the prospect of good, cheap Homestead Law land and better treatment. The all-black town of [[Nicodemus, Kansas]], which was founded in 1877, was an organized settlement that predates the Exodusters but is often associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nell Irvin Painter]], ''Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asians ====
{{main| Chinese American history}}
The [[California Gold Rush]] included thousands of Mexican and Chinese arrivals. Chinese migrants, many of whom were impoverished peasants, provided the major part of the workforce for the building of Central Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. Most of them went home by 1870 when the railroad was finished.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Ng, "The Sojourner, Return Migration, and Immigration History", ''Chinese America: History and Perspectives'' (1995) pp.&amp;nbsp;53–71,&lt;/ref&gt; Those who stayed on worked in mining, agriculture, and opened small shops such as groceries, laundries and restaurants. Hostility remained high as seen by the [[Chinese Massacre Cove]] episode and the [[Rock Springs massacre]]. The Chinese were generally forced into self-sufficient "Chinatowns" in cities such as San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Shih-Shan Henry Tsai, ''The Chinese Experience in America'' (Indiana University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, the last major anti-Chinese riot took place in 1871, after which local law enforcement grew stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Zesch, ''The Chinatown War: Chinese Los Angeles and the Massacre of 1871'' (2012) p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, Chinatowns were squalid slums known for their vice, prostitution, drugs, and violent battles between "tongs". By the 1930s, however, Chinatowns had become clean, safe and attractive tourist destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ivan|last=Light|title=From Vice District to Tourist Attraction: The Moral Career of American Chinatowns, 1880–1940|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=367–394|jstor=3638262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890–1907 era, thousands of [[Japanese American|Japanese]] permanently migrated to Hawaii, Alaska, and California as farm workers. Immigrants born in Asia were generally ineligible for U.S. citizenship until World War II. However, their children born in the U.S. automatically became citizens in accordance to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ingram, ''Japanese Immigrants'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hispanics ====

[[File:Exterior of the Mission Xavier del Bac.jpg|thumb|The Spanish mission of [[Mission San Xavier del Bac|San Xavier del Bac]], near Tucson, founded in 1700]]
{{main| History of Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
The great majority of Hispanics who had been living in the former territories of [[New Spain]] remained and became American citizens in 1848. The 10,000 or so Californios lived in southern California and after 1880 were overshadowed by the hundreds of thousands of arrivals from the east. Those in New Mexico dominated towns and villages that changed little until well into the 20th century. New arrivals from Mexico arrived, especially after the Revolution of 1911 terrorized thousands of villages all across Mexico. Most refugees went to Texas or California, and soon poor [[barrio]]s appeared in many border towns. Early on there was a criminal element as well. The California "Robin Hood", [[Joaquin Murieta]], led a gang in the 1850s which burned houses, killed miners, and robbed stagecoaches. In Texas, [[Juan Cortina]] led a 20-year campaign against Anglos and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], starting around 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldo De Leon and Richard Griswold Del Castillo, ''North to Aztlan: A History of Mexican Americans in the United States'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family life ===

On the [[Great Plains]] very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880–1940'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Montrie, "'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245–258&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ronning, "Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880–1920", ''Uncoverings'', (1992) Vol. 13, pp.&amp;nbsp;169–191&lt;/ref&gt; [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange meetings]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Marti, ''Women of the Grange: Mutuality and Sisterhood in Rural America, 1866–1920'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; church activities, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan B. Sanderson, "More Than a Potluck", ''Nebraska History'', (2008) 89#3 pp. 120–131&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Childhood ====

Childhood on the American frontier is contested territory. One group of scholars, following the lead of novelists [[Willa Cather]] and [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Harris, ''Long Vistas: Women and Families on Colorado Homesteads'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and Elliott West&lt;ref&gt;Elliott West, ''Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far Western Frontier'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and Lillian Schlissel&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, ''Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, ''Childhood on the Farm: Work, Play, and Coming of Age in the Midwest'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostitution ===
{{Further|History of prostitution}}
Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners. World-famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ann Laite, "Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution", ''Historical Journal'', (2009) 53#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;739–761 {{DOI|10.1017/S0018246X09990100}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in the United States|Prostitution]] was a growth industry attracting sex workers from around the globe, pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes; they had to send their earnings back to the family in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucie Cheng|Lucie Cheng Hirata]], "Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century America", ''Signs'' (1979) 5#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–29 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, [[Julia Bulette]], was one of the few who achieved "respectable" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic; this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867; they gave her a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marion S.

It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma of East Coast cities. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later―as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived―did prostitution become less blatant and less common.&lt;ref&gt;Anne M. Butler, ''Daughters of joy, sisters of misery: prostitutes in the American West, 1865–1890'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, worked as laundresses and seamstresses, and strove for independent status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julie Jeffrey|title=Frontier Women: "Civilizing" the West? 1840–1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veCFM5kr4z0C&amp;pg=PA164|year=1998|page=164|isbn=9780809016013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and order ===

[[File:WyattEarp-andothers.jpg|thumb|[[Wyatt Earp]], [[Bat Masterson]], and others on the [[Dodge City Peace Commission]]]]

Historian Waddy W. Moore uses court records to show that on the sparsely settled Arkansas frontier lawlessness was common. He distinguished two types of crimes: unprofessional ([[dueling]], crimes of drunkenness, selling whiskey to the Indians, cutting trees on federal land) and professional ([[rustling]], [[highway robbery]], [[counterfeiting]]).&lt;ref name=MooreCrimeArkansas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Waddy W.|title=Some Aspects of Crime and Punishment on the Arkansas Frontier|journal=Arkansas Historical Quarterly|date=Spring 1964|volume=23|issue=1|pages=50–64|jstor=40021171|doi=10.2307/40021171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminals found many opportunities to rob pioneer families of their possessions, while the few underfunded lawmen had great difficulty detecting, arresting, holding, and convicting wrongdoers. Bandits, typically in groups of two or three, rarely attacked stagecoaches with a guard carrying a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun; it proved less risky to rob teamsters, people on foot, and solitary horsemen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Edward|last=Chapel|title=Guns of the Old West: An Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYwvC6VegwMC&amp;pg=PA280|year= 2002|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-42161-2|pages=280–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; while bank robberies themselves were harder to pull off due to the security of the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-non-existent-frontier-bank-robbery|title=The Non-Existent Frontier Bank Robbery |last=Schweikart |first=Larry |publisher=The Freeman |date= January 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According also to historian Brian Robb, the earliest form of [[organized crime]] in America was born from the gangs of the Old West.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, Brian J. ''A Brief History of Gangsters''. Running Press (January 6, 2015). Chapter 1: Lawlessness in the Old West. {{ISBN|978-0762454761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When criminals were convicted, punishment was severe.&lt;ref name=MooreCrimeArkansas /&gt; Aside from the occasional Western [[sheriff]] and [[United States Marshals Service|Marshal]], there were other various law enforcement agencies throughout the American frontier, such as the [[Texas Rangers (Law Enforcement)|Texas Rangers]] and the [[North-West Mounted Police]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} These lawmen were not just instrumental in keeping peace, but also in protecting the locals from Indian and Mexican threats at the border.&lt;ref&gt;Utley, Robert M., ''Lone Star Lawmen: The Second Century of the Texas Rangers'', Berkley (2008) Chapter I: The Border 1910–1915. {{ISBN|978-0425219386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement tended to be more stringent in towns than in rural areas. Law enforcement emphasized maintaining stability more than armed combat, focusing on drunkenness, disarming cowboys who violated gun-control edicts and dealing with flagrant breaches of gambling and prostitution ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5|pages=116–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dykstra argues that the violent image of the cattle towns in film and fiction is largely myth. The real Dodge City, he says, was the headquarters for the buffalo-hide trade of the Southern Plains and one of the West's principal cattle towns, a sale and shipping point for cattle arriving from Texas. He states there is a "second Dodge City" that belongs to the popular imagination and thrives as a cultural metaphor for violence, chaos, and depravity.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, "Overdosing on Dodge City", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1996) 27#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;505–514 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/970535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; For the cowboy arriving with money in hand after two months on the trail, the town was exciting. A contemporary eyewitness of Hays City, Kansas paints a vivid image of this cattle town:
{{quote|Hays City by lamplight was remarkably lively, but not very moral. The streets blazed with a reflection from saloons, and a glance within showed floors crowded with dancers, the gaily dressed women striving to hide with ribbons and paint the terrible lines which that grim artist, Dissipation, loves to draw upon such faces... To the music of violins and the stamping of feet the dance went on, and we saw in the giddy maze old men who must have been pirouetting on the very edge of their graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Edward |last=Webb |title=Buffalo land: an authentic narrative of the adventures and misadventures of a late scientific and sporting party upon the great plains of the West.

It has been acknowledged that the popular portrayal of Dodge City in film and fiction carries a note of truth, however, as gun crime was rampant in the city prior to the establishment of a local government. Soon after the city's residents officially established their first municipal government, however, a law banning concealed firearms was enacted and crime was reduced soon afterwards. Similar laws were passed in other frontier towns to reduce the rate of gun crime as well. As UCLA law professor Adam Wrinkler noted:

{{quote|Carrying of guns within the city limits of a frontier town was generally prohibited. Laws barring people from carrying weapons were commonplace, from Dodge City to Tombstone. When Dodge City residents first formed their municipal government, one of the very first laws enacted was a ban on concealed carry. The ban was soon after expanded to open carry, too. The Hollywood image of the gunslinger marching through town with two Colts on his hips is just that – a Hollywood image, created for its dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/29/rick-santorums-misguided-view-of-gun-control-in-the-wild-west/ |title=Rick Santorum's misguided view of gun control in the Wild West |first=Glenn |last=Kassler |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tombstone, Arizona]] was a turbulent mining town that flourished longer than most, from 1877 to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric L. |last=Clements |title=Bust and bust in the mining West |journal=Journal of the West |year=1996 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=40–53 |issn=0022-5169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver was discovered in 1877, and by 1881 the town had a population of over 10,000. In 1879 the newly arrived [[Nicholas Porter Earp|Earp brothers]] bought shares in the Vizina mine, water rights, and gambling concessions, but [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]], [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], and [[Morgan Earp]] obtained positions at different times as federal and local lawmen. After more than a year of threats and feuding, they killed [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|three outlaws]] in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], the most famous gunfight of the Old West. In the aftermath, [[Virgil Earp]] was maimed in an ambush and [[Morgan Earp]] was assassinated while playing billiards. Wyatt and others, including his brothers [[James Earp]] and [[Warren Earp]], pursued those they believed responsible in an extra-legal [[Earp Vendetta Ride|vendetta]] and warrants were issued for their arrest in the murder of [[Frank Stilwell]]. The Cochise County Cowboys were one of the first [[organized crime]] syndicates in the United States, and their demise came at the hands of Wyatt Earp.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Bob.

==== Banditry ====

The major type of banditry was conducted by the infamous outlaws of the West, including [[Jesse James]], [[Billy the Kid]], the [[Dalton Gang]], [[Charles Boles|Black Bart]], [[Butch Cassidy]] and the [[Wild Bunch]] and hundreds of others who preyed on banks, trains, stagecoaches, and in some cases even armed government transports such as the [[Wham Paymaster Robbery]] and the [[Skeleton Canyon massacres#1879 Skeleton Canyon Massacre|Skeleton Canyon Robbery]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;336&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the outlaws, such as Jesse James, were products of the violence of the Civil War (James had ridden with [[Quantrill's Raiders]]) and others became outlaws during hard times in the cattle industry. Many were misfits and drifters who roamed the West avoiding the law. In rural areas [[Joaquin Murieta]], [[Jack Powers]], [[Augustine Chacon]] and other bandits terrorized the state. When outlaw gangs were near, towns would occasionally raise a posse to drive them out or capture them. Seeing that the need to combat the bandits was a growing business opportunity, [[Allan Pinkerton]] ordered his National Detective Agency, founded in 1850, to open branches out West, and they got into the business of pursuing and capturing outlaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James David|last=Horan|title=The Pinkertons: the detective dynasty that made history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVlCAAAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Crown Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was plenty of business thanks to the criminals such as the [[James-Younger Gang|James Gang]], [[Butch Cassidy]], [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]], and dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Bill O'Neal, ''Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; To take refuge from the law, outlaws would use the advantages of the [[open range]], [[Hole-in-the-Wall|remote passes]] and [[badlands]] to hide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulick|first=Bill|title=Manhunt: The Pursuit of Harry Tracy|year=1999|publisher=Caxton Press|isbn=0-87004-392-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bZSdHchp3WkC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=%22Hole+in+the+Wall+Gang%22+subject:%22Biography+%26+Autobiography+/+Criminals+%26+Outlaws%22|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some settlements and towns in the frontier also house outlaws and criminals, which were called "outlaw towns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mkVGPQAACAAJ&amp;dq=ISBN9780935269062 |title= Gunfight at Ingalls: Death of an Outlaw Town |last= Shirley |first=Glenn |year=1990 |work= |publisher= Barbed Wire Press |isbn= 9780935269062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalton Gang memento mori 1892.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Dalton Gang]] after the Battle of Coffeyville in 1892.]]
Banditry was a major issue in California after 1849, as thousands of young men detached from family or community moved into a land with few law enforcement mechanisms. To combat this, the [[San Francisco Committee of Vigilance]] was established to give [[drumhead trial]]s and death sentences to well-known offenders. As such, other earlier settlements created their own private agencies to protect communities due to the lack of peace-keeping establishments.&lt;ref name="CultureViolence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=803|title=The Culture of Violence in the American West: Myth versus Reality |last=DiLorenzo |first= Thomas J. |publisher=The Independent Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/f/fallonMalachi.html |title=Malachi Fallon First Chief of Police |first=Kevin |last=Mullen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731183542/http://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/f/fallonMalachi.html |archivedate=July 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These vigilance committees reflected different occupations in the frontier, such as land clubs, cattlemen's associations and mining camps. Similar vigilance committees also existed in Texas, and their main objective was to stamp out lawlessness and rid communities of desperadoes and [[Cattle rustling|rustlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasobserver.org/troubled-times/|title=Troubled Times |last=Barton |first=Julia |work=Texas Observer |date=August 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees would sometimes form mob rule for private [[vigilante]] groups, but usually were made up of responsible citizens who wanted only to maintain order. Criminals caught by these vigilance committees were treated cruelly; often hung or shot without any form of trial.&lt;ref name="Vigil"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jnv01|title=Vigilantes and Vigilance Committees|last=Gard |first=Wayne |publisher=Handbook of Texas |date= June 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians also took arms to defend themselves in the Old West, sometimes siding with lawmen ([[Dalton Gang#Coffeyville Bank Robbery|Coffeyville Bank Robbery]]), or siding with outlaws ([[Battle of Ingalls]]). In the Post-Civil War frontier, over 523 whites, 34 blacks and 75 others were victims of lynching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwightmurphey-collectedwritings.info/mono/mono1.htm|title=Lynching: History and Analysis|last=Murphey|publisher= Journal of Social and Economic Studies Legal-Studies Monograph Series |year= 1995|accessdate=March 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cases of lynching in the Old West wasn't primarily caused by the absence of a legal system, but also because of social class. Historian Michael J. Pfeifer writes, "Contrary to the popular understanding, early territorial lynching did not flow from an absence or distance of law enforcement but rather from the social instability of early communities and their contest for property, status, and the definition of social order."&lt;ref name="pfeifer-frontier-quote"&gt;Michael J. Pfeifer, ''Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874–1947'' (U of Illinois Press, 2004), p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gunfights and feuds ===

The names and exploits of Western gunslingers took a major role in American folklore, fiction and film. Their guns and costumes became children's toys for make-believe shootouts.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;Linda S. Watts, ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'' (2007) p.&amp;nbsp;36, 224, 252&lt;/ref&gt; The stories became immensely popular in Germany and other European countries, which produced their own novels and films about the American frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth based on repeated exaggerations. The most notable and well-known took place in Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were more episodic than being a common thing, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied.&lt;ref name="Neo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/06/07/the-truth-about-gunfights-in-the-old-west/|title=The Truth About Gunfights in the Old West|publisher=Neatorama|author=Miss Cellania}} June 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen.

Other conflicts over land and territory were also fought such as the [[Regulator–Moderator War]], [[Cortina Troubles]], [[Las Cuevas War]] and the [[Bandit War]].

[[Family feuds in the United States|Feuds]] involving families and bloodlines also occurred much in the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-feuds.html|title=Legends of America: Feuds and Range Wars|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since private agencies and vigilance committees were the substitute for proper courts, many families initially depended on themselves and their communities for their security and justice. These wars include the [[Lincoln County War]], [[Tutt–Everett War]], [[Hot Springs Gunfight|Flynn–Doran feud]], [[Early–Hasley feud]], [[Brooks-Baxter War]], [[Sutton–Taylor feud]], [[Horrell Brothers]] feud, [[Brooks–McFarland Feud]], [[Reese–Townsend feud]] and the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]].

=== Cattle ===
{{Main|Cattle drives in the United States}}

The end of the bison herds opened up millions of acres for cattle ranching.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis E. Atherton, ''The Cattle Kings'' (1961), is an influential interpretive study&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a brief survey and bibliography see {{cite book|first1=Ray Allen|last1=Billington|first2=Martin|last2=Ridge|title=Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoV-k7VcyZ0C|year=2001|publisher=U. of New Mexico Press|pages=611–28, 837–42|isbn=9780826319814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish cattlemen had introduced cattle ranching and longhorn cattle to the Southwest in the 17th century, and the men who worked the ranches, called "vaqueros", were the first "cowboys" in the West. After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (130+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The [[Chisholm Trail]], laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the {{convert|800|mi|km}} from south Texas to [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 back East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ted|last=Morgan|title=Shovel of Stars: The Making of the American West 1800 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aveRrVPqc0UC&amp;pg=PA257|year=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=257|isbn=9780684814926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s and 1880s, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts. Many of the largest ranches were owned by Scottish and English financiers. The single largest cattle ranch in the entire West was owned by American John W. Iliff, "cattle king of the Plains", operating in Colorado and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Boorstin|title=The Americans: The Democratic Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RicRyr47FMgC&amp;pg=PT23|year=1974|publisher=Random House|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, longhorns were replaced by the American breeds of [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] and [[Angus (cattle)|Angus]], introduced by settlers from the Northwest. Though less hardy and more disease-prone, these breeds produced better tasting beef and matured faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard W.|last=Slatta|title=The Cowboy Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_08YPVPGE_MC&amp;pg=PA227|year=1996|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funding for the cattle industry came largely from British sources, as the European investors engaged in a speculative extravaganza—a "bubble". Graham concludes the mania was founded on genuine opportunity, as well as "exaggeration, gullibility, inadequate communications, dishonesty, and incompetence". A severe winter engulfed the plains toward the end of 1886 and well into 1887, locking the prairie grass under ice and crusted snow which starving herds could not penetrate. The British lost most of their money—as did eastern investors like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], but their investments did create a large industry that continues to cycle through boom and bust periods.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Graham, "The Investment Boom in British-Texan Cattle Companies 1880–1885", ''Business History Review'' (1960) 34#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;421–445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111428 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

On a much smaller scale sheep grazing was locally popular; sheep were easier to feed and needed less water. However, Americans did not eat mutton. As farmers moved in [[open range]] cattle ranching came to an end and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to "fence wars" which erupted over disputes about water rights.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dick, ''Vanguards of the Frontier: A Social History of the Northern Plains and Rocky Mountains from the Fur Traders to the Busters'' (1941) pp 497–508.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Montejano|title=Anglos and Mexicans in the Making of Texas, 1836–1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnUKT4f_fZQC&amp;pg=PA87|year=1987|publisher=U. of Texas Press|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cowboys ====

[[File:Charles Marion Russell – Smoke of a .45 – Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Charles Marion Russell – Smoke of a .45]]
Central to the myth and the reality of the West is the American [[cowboy]]. His real life was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. Working the cattle was not just a routine job but also a lifestyle that exulted in the freedom of the wide unsettled outdoors on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ii.015|title=Cowboy Culture|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|last=Wishart|first=David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long drives hired one cowboy for about 250 head of cattle.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Lamar 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;269"&gt;Howard R. Lamar (1977), p.&amp;nbsp;269&lt;/ref&gt; Saloons were ubiquitous (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond B. Wrabley, Jr., "Drunk Driving or Dry Run? Cowboys and Alcohol on the Cattle Trail". ''Kansas History'' (2007) 30#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;36–51 [http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-history-spring-2007/12433 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle.&lt;ref name="Don"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/article/history-vaquero|title=The History of the Vaquero|publisher=American Cowboy|last=Livingston|first=Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and [[rustler]]s, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the [[Bowie knife]], [[lasso]], [[bullwhip]], pistols, rifles and shotguns.&lt;ref name="Sarah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Don"&gt;Rickey, Don, Jr. 1976. ''$10 Horse, $40 Saddle: Cowboy Clothing, Arms, Tools and Horse Gear of the 1880s'', pp.&amp;nbsp;62–90, The Old Army Press. {{ISBN|0803289774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the cowboys were veterans of the Civil War; a diverse group, they included Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and immigrants from many lands.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Freedman, ''Cowboys of the Wild West''(1985) p.&amp;nbsp;103 {{ISBN|0-590-47565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest cowboys in Texas learned their trade, adapted their clothing, and took their jargon from the Mexican vaqueros or "buckaroos", the heirs of Spanish cattlemen from middle-south of Spain. Chaps, the heavy protective leather trousers worn by cowboys, got their name from the Spanish "chaparreras", and the lariat, or rope, was derived from "la reata". All the distinct clothing of the cowboy—boots, saddles, hats, pants, [[chaps]], slickers, [[bandanna]]s, gloves, and collar-less shirts—were practical and adaptable, designed for protection and comfort. The [[cowboy hat]] quickly developed the capability, even in the early years, to identify its wearer as someone associated with the West; it came to symbolize the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;William Reynolds, and Rich Rand, ''The Cowboy Hat book'' (1995) p.&amp;nbsp;10 {{ISBN|0-87905-656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most enduring fashion adapted from the cowboy, popular nearly worldwide today, are "blue jeans", originally made by [[Levi Strauss]] for miners in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Howard R. Lamar (1977), p.&amp;nbsp;272&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a drive, a cowboy's duties included riding out on the range and bringing together the scattered cattle. The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. While camping every night, cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingstories.com/Stories/Why%20Cowboys%20Sing.pdf|title=Why Cowboys Sing?|publisher=Wyoming Stories|first=Wylie Grant|last=Sherwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work days often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, and brawling were often prohibited and fined, and sometimes cursing as well. It was monotonous and boring work, with food to match: bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes. On average, cowboys earned $30 to $40 per month, because of the heavy physical and emotional toll, it was unusual for a cowboy to spend more than seven years on the range.&lt;ref&gt;Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;268–270&lt;/ref&gt; As [[open range]] ranching and the long drives gave way to fenced-in ranches in the 1880s, by the 1890s the glory days of the cowboy came to an end, and the myths about the "free living" cowboy began to emerge.&lt;ref name="murdoch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, William and Rich Rand, ''The Cowboy Hat book'' (1995) p.&amp;nbsp;15 {{ISBN|0-87905-656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cowtowns ====

Anchoring the booming cattle industry of the 1860s and 1870s were the cattle towns in Kansas and Missouri. Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Dodge City]], and [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became [[ghost town]]s and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert R.|last=Dykstra|title=The Cattle Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t15L9AfXlPcC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and environmentalism ==

[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|1908 editorial cartoon of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] features his cowboy persona and his crusading for conservation.]]

Concern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum exploitation of natural resources to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, ''Gifford Pinchot and the making of modern environmentalism'' (2001) p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center were the [[conservation movement|conservationists]], led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with [[Gifford Pinchot]] and used the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&amp;nbsp;mi² or 930,000&amp;nbsp;km²) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt explained his position in 1910:

{{quote|Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was [[John Muir]] (1838–1914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the [[Sierra Club]]. Muir, based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the sequoias in the Yosemite Valley; Congress did pass the Yosemite National Park bill (1890). In 1897 President [[Grover Cleveland]] created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis C. Williams, ''God's wilds: John Muir's vision of nature'' (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;134&lt;/ref&gt; crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest "between landscape righteousness and the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Dorman, ''A word for nature: four pioneering environmental advocates, 1845–1913'' (1998) p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt; A master publicist, Muir's magazine articles, in ''Harper's Weekly'' (June 5, 1897) and the ''Atlantic Monthly'' turned the tide of public sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;John Muir, [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=atla;idno=atla0080-2 "The American Forests"]&lt;/ref&gt; He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt's program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President [[William Howard Taft]] on the [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer Donald Worster says, "Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster|title=A passion for nature: the life of John Muir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuAsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Oxford U.

{{Main|American Bison}}

The rise of the cattle industry and the cowboy is directly tied to the demise of the huge herds of bison—usually called the "buffalo". Once numbering over 25 million on the Great Plains, the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the Plains Indians, providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction. The last 10–15&amp;nbsp;million died out in a decade 1872–1883; only 100 survived.&lt;ref&gt;M. Scott Taylor, "Buffalo Hunt: International Trade and the Virtual Extinction of the North American Bison", ''American Economic Review'', (Dec 2011) 101#7 pp.&amp;nbsp;3162–3195&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes that depended on the buffalo had little choice but to accept the government offer of reservations, where the government would feed and supply them on condition they did not go on the warpath. [[Conservation in the United States|Conservationists]] founded the [[American Bison Society]] in 1905; it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds. Several national parks in the U.S. and Canada were created, in part to provide a sanctuary for bison and other large wildlife, with no hunting allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn E. Plumb, and Rosemary Sucec, "A Bison Conservation History in the U.S. National Parks", ''Journal of the West'', (2006) 45#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;22–28,&lt;/ref&gt; The bison population reached 500,000 by 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney P. Boyd and C. Cormack Gates, "A Brief Review of the Status of Plains Bison in North America", ''Journal of the West'', (2006) 45#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;15–21&lt;/ref&gt;

== American frontier in popular culture ==

[[File:Buffalo bill wild west show c1899.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[Buffalo Bill]]'s Wild West'' Show]]

The exploration, settlement, exploitation, and conflicts of the "American Old West" form a unique tapestry of events, which has been celebrated by Americans and foreigners alike—in art, music, dance, novels, magazines, short stories, poetry, theater, video games, movies, radio, television, song, and oral tradition—which continues in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Slatta, "Making and unmaking myths of the American frontier", ''European Journal of American Culture'' (2010) 29#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;81–92&lt;/ref&gt; Levy argues that the physical and mythological West inspired composers [[Aaron Copland]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Virgil Thomson]], [[Charles Wakefield Cadman]], and [[Arthur Farwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Beth E. Levy, ''Frontier Figures: American Music and the Mythology of the American West'' (University of California Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious themes have inspired many environmentalists as they contemplate the pristine West before the frontiersmen violated its spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dunlap, ''Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Nature-Environmentalism-Weyerhaeuser-Environmental/dp/0295985569/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, as historian [[William Cronon]] has demonstrated, the concept of "wilderness" was highly negative and the antithesis of religiosity before the romantic movement of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, "The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature" in William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature'' (1995) pp: 69–90 [http://www.williamcronon.net/writing/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frontier Thesis]] of historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], proclaimed in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/TURNER/ The Frontier In American History] the original 1893 essay by Turner&lt;/ref&gt; established the main lines of historiography which fashioned scholarship for three or four generations and appeared in the textbooks used by practically all American students.&lt;ref&gt;Roger L. Nichols, ed. ''American Frontier and Western Issues: An Historiographical Review'' (1986), essays by 14 scholars&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popularizing Western lore ===

The mythologizing of the West began with minstrel shows and popular music in the 1840s. During the same period, [[P. T. Barnum]] presented Indian chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness really took off when the [[dime novel]] appeared in 1859, the first being ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Utley (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;253&lt;/ref&gt; By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public's attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism, and fixed in the public's mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains—courageous cowboys and savage Indians, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis' ''Seth Jones'' (1860). [[Ned Buntline]]'s stories glamorized [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Edward Lytton Wheeler|Edward L. Wheeler]] created "[[Deadwood Dick]]", "Hurricane Nell", and "Calamity Jane".&lt;ref&gt;Howard R. Lamar (1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first "Wild West" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer's Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and Indians, as well as sure-shooting [[Annie Oakley]].&lt;ref&gt;Joy S. Kasson, ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West: Celebrity, Memory, and Popular History'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite Eastern writers and artists of the late 19th century promoted and celebrated western lore.&lt;ref name="Christine Bold 2013"/&gt; Theodore Roosevelt, wearing his hats as historian, explorer, hunter, rancher and naturalist, was especially productive.&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward White, ''The Eastern Establishment and the Western Experience: The West of Frederic Remington, Theodore Roosevelt, and Owen Wister'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Their work appeared in upscale national magazines such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' featured illustrations by artists [[Frederic Remington]], [[Charles M. Russell]], and others. Readers bought action-filled stories by writers like [[Owen Wister]], conveying vivid images of the Old West.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Bold, "The Rough Riders at Home and Abroad: Cody, Roosevelt, Remington and the Imperialist Hero", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' (1987) 18#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;321–350&lt;/ref&gt; Remington lamented the passing of an era he helped to chronicle when he wrote:

{{quote|I knew the wild riders and the vacant land were about to vanish forever...I saw the living, breathing end of three American centuries of smoke and dust and sweat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Nicolas S.|editor-last=Witschi|title=A Companion to the Literature and Culture of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gm0vRsG7jZ8C&amp;pg=PA271|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 20th century imagery ===

[[File:SearchersPoster-BillGold.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Searchers (film)|''The Searchers'']], a 1956 film portraying racial conflict in the 1860s]]

In the 20th century, both tourists to the West and avid readers enjoyed the visual imagery of the frontier. The Western movies provided the most famous examples, as in the numerous films of [[John Ford]]. He was especially enamored of [[Monument Valley]]. Critic Keith Phipps says, "its {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=sqbr|spell=in}} have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/features/2009/the_easy_rider_road_trip/monument_valley_where_peter_and_henry_fondas_careers_intersected.html The ''Easy Rider'' Road Trip]".

Harvey, ''Rainbow Bridge to Monument Valley: Making the Modern Old West'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The heroic stories coming out of the building of the transcontinental railroad in the mid-1860s enlivened many dime novels, and illustrated many newspapers and magazines with the juxtaposition of traditional environment with the iron horse of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Gardner Willumson, ''Iron Muse: Photographing the Transcontinental Railroad'' (2013).

==== Cowboy images ====

The cowboy has for over a century been an iconic American image both in the country and abroad; recognized worldwide and revered by Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William W.|last=Savage|title=The cowboy hero: his image in American history &amp; culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or7w5UKtqS0C&amp;pg=PR11|year=1979|publisher=U. of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-1920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous popularizers of the image include part-time cowboy and "Rough Rider" President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919), who made "cowboy" internationally synonymous with the brash aggressive American, and [[Indian Territory]]-born trick roper [[Will Rogers]] (1879–1935), the leading humorist of the 1920s.

Roosevelt conceptualized the herder (cowboy) as a stage of civilization distinct from the sedentary farmer—a theme well expressed in the 1944 Hollywood hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' that highlights the enduring conflict between cowboys and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Slotkin, "Nostalgia and progress: Theodore Roosevelt's myth of the frontier". ''American Quarterly'' (1981): pp.&amp;nbsp;608–637. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712805 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt argued that the manhood typified by the cowboy—and outdoor activity and sports generally—was essential if American men were to avoid the softness and rot produced by an easy life in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah Lyons|last=Watts|title=Rough rider in the White House: Theodore Roosevelt and the politics of desire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vh8vRr1_iykC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2003|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87607-8|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Rogers, the son of a Cherokee judge in Oklahoma, started with rope tricks and fancy riding, but by 1919 discovered his audiences were even more enchanted with his wit in his representation of the wisdom of the common man.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Ware, "Unexpected Cowboy, Unexpected Indian: The Case of Will Rogers", ''Ethnohistory'', (2009) 56#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–34 {{DOI| 10.1215/00141801-2008-034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who contributed to enhancing the romantic image of the American cowboy include [[Charles Siringo]] (1855–1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Howard|last=Lamar|title=Charlie Siringo's West: an interpretive biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qsr7-ThlRe0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=2005|publisher=U of New Mexico Press |isbn=978-0-8263-3669-9 |pages=137–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andy Adams (writer)|Andy Adams]] (1859–1935). Cowboy, Pinkerton detective, and western author, Siringo was the first authentic cowboy autobiographer. Adams spent the 1880s in the cattle industry in Texas and 1890s mining in the Rockies. When an 1898 play's portrayal of Texans outraged Adams, he started writing plays, short stories, and novels drawn from his own experiences. His ''The Log of a Cowboy'' (1903) became a classic novel about the cattle business, especially the cattle drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andy|last=Adams|title=The log of a cowboy: a narrative of the old trail days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ho4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1903|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company}}, full text&lt;/ref&gt; It described a fictional drive of the Circle Dot herd from Texas to Montana in 1882, and became a leading source on cowboy life; historians retraced its path in the 1960s, confirming its basic accuracy. His writings are acclaimed and criticized for realistic fidelity to detail on the one hand and thin literary qualities on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey L. Carter, "Retracing a Cattle Drive: Andy Adams's 'The Log of a Cowboy,'" ''Arizona &amp; the West'' (1981) 23#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;355–378&lt;/ref&gt; Many regard [[Red River (1948 film)|''Red River'' (1948)]], directed by Howard Hawks, and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift, as an authentic cattle drive depiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Randy|last1=Roberts|first2=James Stuart|last2=Olson|title=John Wayne: American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOPU1Zu7gjwC&amp;pg=PA304|year=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique skills of the cowboys are highlighted in the [[rodeo]]. It began in organized fashion in the West in the 1880s, when several Western cities followed up on touring Wild West shows and organized celebrations that included rodeo activities. The establishment of major cowboy competitions in the East in the 1920s led to the growth of rodeo sports. Trail cowboys who were also known as gunfighters like [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Luke Short]] and others, were known for their prowess, [[Fast draw|speed]] and skill with their pistols and other firearms. Their violent escapades and reputations morphed over time into the stereotypical image of violence endured by the "cowboy hero".&lt;ref name="Watts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Agnew, ''The Creation of the Cowboy Hero: Fiction, Film and Fact''(McFarland, 2014)  pp. 38–40, 88.  {{ISBN|978-0786478392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert K.

=== Code of the West ===

Historians of the American West have written about the mythic West; the west of western literature, art and of people's shared memories.&lt;ref name="Milner MT Shared Memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milner, II|first1=Clyde A.|title=The Shard Memory of Montana Pioneers|journal=Montana the Magazine of Western History|date=Winter 1987|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–13|jstor=4519027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is "the Imagined West".&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, ''It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own'' (1991), ch 21&lt;/ref&gt; The "Code of the West" was an unwritten, socially agreed upon set of informal laws shaping the [[cowboy culture]] of the Old West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-codewest.html|title=The Code of the West|publisher=Legends of America|last= Weiser|first=Kathy}} January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nofziger|first1=Lyn|title=Unwritten Laws, Indelible Truths|journal=American Cowboy|date=March–April 2005|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-oCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=Nofziger+Lyn+2005+American+Cowboy#v=onepage|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview|url=http://www.livingthecode.org./livingthecode/overview.html|website=Living the Code|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the cowboys developed a personal culture of their own, a blend of values that even retained vestiges of [[chivalry]]. Such hazardous work in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self-dependence and individualism, with great value put on personal honesty, exemplified in [[List of famous Cowboy songs|songs]] and [[cowboy poetry]].&lt;ref name=CattleKings241&gt;Atherton, Lewis ''The Cattle Kings'', (University of Nebraska Press 1961) pp.&amp;nbsp;241–262.&lt;/ref&gt; The code also included the [[Gunfighter]], who sometimes followed a form of [[Code duello#Western Code Duello|code duello]] adopted from the Old South, in order to solve disputes and [[Gunfighter#Real-life Wild West duels|duels]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South''.

== End of the frontier ==

Following the [[1890 United States Census|eleventh U.S. Census]] taken in 1890 the superintendent announced that there was no longer a clear line of advancing settlement, and hence no longer a frontier in the continental United States. Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] seized upon the statistic to announce the end of the era in which the frontier process shaped the American character.

Fresh farmland was increasingly hard to find after 1890—although the railroads advertised some in eastern Montana. Bicha shows that nearly 600,000 American farmers sought cheap land by moving to the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie frontier of the Canadian West]] from 1897 to 1914. However, about two-thirds of them grew disillusioned and returned to the U.S.&lt;ref name="murdoch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel Denis Bicha, "The Plains Farmer and the Prairie Province Frontier, 1897–1914", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', (Nov 1965) 109#6 pp.&amp;nbsp;398–440 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/986139 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of Oklahoma as a state in 1907 upon the combination of the [[Oklahoma Territory]] and the last remaining [[Indian Territory]], and the Arizona and New Mexico territories as states in 1912, did not end the frontier. These contained plenty of unoccupied land, as did the territory of Alaska. Nevertheless, the ethos and storyline of the "American frontier" had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Cloud|title=The Coming of the Frontier Press: How the West Was Really Won|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LVzRxYMIOMC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2008|publisher=Northwestern University Press|pages=17–18|isbn=9780810125087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==

Scores of Turner students became professors in history departments in the western states, and taught courses on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Etulain, ed. ''Writing Western History'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have debunked many of the myths of the frontier, but they nevertheless live on in community traditions, folklore and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Slatta, "Making and unmaking myths of the American frontier", ''European Journal of American Culture'' (2010) 29#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;81–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s a historiographical range war broke out between the traditional frontier studies, which stress the influence of the frontier on all of American history and culture, and the "[[New Western History]]" which narrows the geographical and time framework to concentrate on the trans-Mississippi West after 1850. It avoids the word "frontier" and stresses cultural interaction between white culture and groups such as Indians and Hispanics. History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this "New Western History" approach:

{{quote|It is easy to tell who the bad guys are – they are almost invariably white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class.... Anglo-American civilization....is represented as patriarchal, racist, genocidal, and destructive of the environment, in addition to hypocritically betrayed the ideals on which it supposedly is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William E. |last=Weeks|chapter=American Expansionism, 1815–1860|editor-first=Robert D.|editor-last=Schulzinger|title=A Companion to American Foreign Relations|publisher=Blackwell|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_jk8rKq5_MC&amp;pg=PA65|page=65|isbn=9780470999035}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, by 2005, Aron argues, the two sides had "reached an equilibrium in their rhetorical arguments and critiques".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Aron, "Convergence, California, and the Newest Western History", ''California History'' (2009) 86#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;4–13; Aron, "What's West, What's Next", ''OAH Magazine of History'' (2005) 19#5 pp.&amp;nbsp;22–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[environmental history]] has emerged, in large part from the frontier historiography, hence its emphasis on wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, "American environmental history: the development of a new historical field". ''Pacific Historical Review'' (1985): 54#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;297–335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3639634 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an increasingly large role in frontier studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mart A. Stewart, "If John Muir Had Been an Agrarian: American Environmental History West and South", ''Environment &amp; History'' (2005) 11#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;139–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians approached the environment from the point of view of the frontier or regionalism. The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment; the second looks at the influence of the environment. [[William Cronon]] has argued that Turner's famous 1893 essay was environmental history in an embryonic form. It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers, making a transition from wilderness to civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Isenberg, "Environment and the Nineteenth-Century West; or, Process Encounters Place". pp. 77–92 in {{cite book|author=William Deverell, ed.|title=A Companion to the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3q_0ZgquK4C&amp;pg=PA78|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|page=78|isbn=9781405138482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Samuel Lubell saw similarities between the frontier's Americanization of immigrants that Turner described and the [[social climbing]] by later immigrants in large cities as they moved to wealthier neighborhoods. He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile, and Western settlers' "land hunger" to poor city residents seeking social status. Just as the Republican party benefited from support from "old" immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms, "new" urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic [[New Deal coalition]] that began with [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="lubell1956"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6193934M/The_future_of_American_politics. | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | last=Lubell|first=Samuel | year=1956 | pages=65–68, 82–83 | edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s an active center is the history department at the [[University of New Mexico]], along with the University of New Mexico Press. Leading historians there include Gerald D. Nash, Donald C. Cutter, Richard N. Ellis, Richard Etulain, Margaret Connell-Szasz, Paul Hutton, Virginia Scharff, and Samuel Truett. The department has collaborated with other departments and emphasizes Southwestern regionalism, minorities in the Southwest, and historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Etulain, "Clio's Disciples on the Rio Grande: Western History at the University of New Mexico", ''New Mexico Historical Review'' (Summer 2012) 87#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;277–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Annales'' school}} 
The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel,&lt;ref&gt;Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argues that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295|isbn=9780375422348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.&lt;ref&gt;On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).&lt;ref name="journal names"&gt;P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past &amp; Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward&lt;/ref&gt;
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Hinrichs, "Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay," ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots.  Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Has been cited as a key influence in the development of [[World Systems Theory]] by sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel M. 2004. World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Argippaeans''' or '''Argippaei''' are a people mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]].'' He mentions them as north of the Scythians and much of the scholarship points to them being a tribe near the [[Ural Mountains]].

==In Herodotus==

{{quotation|
As far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been speaking is all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on a region which is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this rough country, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all—both men and women—bald from their birth, to have flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language of their own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian. They live on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum; in size it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like a bean, with a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloths; the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is called by the natives “aschy.” They lap this up with their tongues, and also mix it with milk for a drink; while they make the lees, which are solid, into cakes, and eat them instead of meat; for they have but few sheep in their country, in which there is no good pasturage. Each of them dwells under a tree, and they cover the tree in winter with a cloth of thick white felt, but take off the covering in the summer-time. No one harms these people, for they are looked upon as sacred—they do not even possess any warlike weapons. When their neighbours fall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one flies to them for refuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the Argippaeans.” |Herodotus | The Histories | Translated by George Rawlinson &lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/herodotus/h4/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:A Study of History.jpg|thumb|[[D. C. Somervell|Somervell's]] abridgement of Toynbee's ''[[A Study of History|magnum opus]]'']]

'''Arnold Joseph Toynbee''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CH|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔɪ|n|b|i}}; 14 April 1889 – 22 October 1975) was a British [[historian]], [[philosopher of history]], research professor of [[comparative history|international history]] at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of London]] and author of numerous books. Toynbee in the 1918–1950 period was a leading specialist on [[International relations|international affairs]].

He is best known for his 12-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1934–1961). With his prodigious output of papers, articles, speeches and presentations, and numerous books translated into many languages, Toynbee was a widely read and discussed scholar in the [[1940s in sociology|1940s]] and [[1950s in sociology|1950s]].

==Biography==
Toynbee (born in [[London in the 1960s|London]] on 14 April 1889) was the son of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861–1941), secretary of the [[Charity Organization Society]], and his wife Sarah Edith Marshall (1859–1939); his sister [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] was an archaeologist and art historian. Toynbee was the grandson of [[Joseph Toynbee]], nephew of the [[19th-century philosophy|19th-century]] economist [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1852–1883) and descendant of prominent British intellectuals for several generations. He won scholarships to [[Winchester College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] ([[Literae Humaniores]], 1907-1911),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orry|first1=Louise|title=Arnold Toynbee, Brief Lives|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198600879|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied briefly at the [[British School at Athens]], an experience that influenced the genesis of his philosophy about the decline of civilizations. 

In 1912 he became a tutor and fellow in ancient history at Balliol College, and in 1915 he began working for the intelligence department of the [[British Foreign Office]]. After serving as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 he served as professor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Modern Greece|modern Greek studies]] at the [[University of London]]. It was here that Toynbee was appointed to the [[Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature |Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature]] at [[King's College London|King's College]], although he would ultimately resign following a controversial academic dispute with the professoriate of the College.&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/classics/about/index.aspx | title=King's College London - Classics at King's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4283087|title = Politics and the Academy: Arnold Toynbee and the Koraes Chair|journal = Middle Eastern Studies|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = v–115|last1 = Clogg|first1 = Richard|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1922 he was the Manchester [[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian]] correspondent during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], an experience that resulted in the publication of ''The Western Question in Greece and Turkey''.&lt;ref name=toynbee1922&gt;{{cite book |last=Toynbee |first=Arnold J. |title=The Western Question in Greece and Turkey: A Study in the Contact of Civilisations |url=http://louisville.edu/a-s/history/turks/WesternQuestion.pdf |year=1922 |location=London |publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable and Company Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he became research professor of international history at the [[London School of Economics]] and director of studies at the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in London. He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdoms national academy for the humanities and social sciences, in 1937.&lt;ref name="WWW"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Toynbee, Arnold Joseph |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |website=[[Who Was Who]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=14 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |date=1 December 2007|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), daughter of [[Gilbert Murray]], in 1913; they had three sons, of whom [[Philip Toynbee]] was the second. They divorced in 1946; Toynbee then married his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter (1893-1980), in the same year.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p124&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

==Academic and cultural influence==
[[File:Toynbee1.jpg|thumb|Toynbee on the front cover of Time magazine, 17 March 1947. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793438,00.html read the ''Time'' article]]]

Michael Lang says that for much of the twentieth century: 
{{quote|Toynbee was perhaps the world’s most read, translated, and discussed living scholar. His output was enormous, hundreds of books, pamphlets, and articles. Of these, scores were translated into thirty different languages....the critical reaction to Toynbee constitutes a veritable intellectual history of the midcentury: we find a long list of the period’s most important historians, [[Charles Austin Beard|Beard]], [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]], [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]], and so on.&lt;ref name=lang2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Michael |title=Globalization and Global History in Toynbee |date=December 2011 |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=747–783 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2011.0118 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2014--&gt;{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his best-known work, ''[[A Study of History]]'', published 1934–1961, Toynbee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...examined the rise and fall of 26 civilizations in the course of [[human history]], and he concluded that they rose by responding successfully to challenges under the leadership of creative minorities composed of elite leaders.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee&gt;{{cite web |title= Arnold Toynbee |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601310/Arnold-Joseph-Toynbee |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online Academic Edition |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |date= 6 Apr 2014 |accessdate= 6 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''A Study of History'' was both a commercial and academic phenomenon. In the U.S. alone, more than seven thousand sets of the ten-volume edition had been sold by 1955. Most people, including scholars, relied on the very clear one-volume abridgement of the first six volumes by [[D. C. Somervell|Somervell]], which appeared in 1947; the abridgement sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. The press printed innumerable discussions of Toynbee's work, not to mention there being countless lectures and seminars. Toynbee himself often participated. He appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1947, with an article describing his work as "the most provocative work of historical theory written in England since Karl Marx’s ''Capital''”,&lt;ref name=kennan1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennan |first=George F. |authorlink=George F. Kennan|title=The History of Arnold Toynbee |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/01/the-history-of-arnold-toynbee/?pagination=false |date=1 June 1989 |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a regular commentator on [[BBC]] (examining the history of and reasons for the current hostility between east and west, and considering how non-westerners view the western world).&lt;ref name=montagu1956&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Montagu |editor1-first=M.

Canadian historians were especially receptive to Toynbee's work in the late [[1940s in sociology|1940s]]. The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Adams Innis]] (1894–1952) was a notable example. Following Toynbee and others (Spengler, Kroeber, Sorokin, Cochrane), Innis examined the flourishing of civilizations in terms of administration of empires and media of communication.&lt;ref name=massolin2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Massolin |first=Philip Alphonse |title=Canadian Intellectuals, the Tory Tradition, and the Challenge of Modernity, 1939–1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fL-lB1VJ4wC&amp;pg=PA162 |year=2001 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0802035097 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee's overall theory was taken up by some scholars, for example, [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], as a sort of paradigm in the post-war period. Curtius wrote as follows in the opening pages of ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953 English translation), following close on Toynbee, as he sets the stage for his vast study of [[medieval Latin]] literature. Curtius wrote, "How do cultures, and the historical entities which are their media, arise, grow and decay? Only a comparative morphology with exact procedures can hope to answer these questions. It was Arnold J. Toynbee who undertook the task."&lt;ref name=curtius1953&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtius |first=Ernst Robert |authorlink=Ernst Robert Curtius|title=European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/European_Literature_and_the_Latin_Middle.html?id=WrSpNfsBcocC |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1953|isbn=978-0691018997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960, Toynbee's ideas faded both in academia and the media, to the point of seldom being cited today.&lt;ref name=mcintire1989&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=McIntire |editor1-first=C.

For example, Diamond writes in ''Collapse'' that if the elites are insulated from problems in society and not actively engaged, they are more apt to make mistakes. Thus, Diamond may be stating that elites can not mount effective responses to challenges if their knowledge, sympathy, or own self-interest are not sufficiently the same as the broader society.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Political influence in foreign policy==
&lt;blockquote&gt; While the writing of the Study was under way, Toynbee produced numerous smaller works and served as director of foreign research of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1939–43) and director of the research department of the Foreign Office (1943–46); he also retained his position at the London School of Economics until his retirement in 1956.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Toynbee worked for the [[Political Intelligence Department (1918–1920)|Political Intelligence Department]] of the [[Foreign Office|British Foreign Office]] during [[World War I]] and served as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919. He was director of studies at Chatham House, Balliol College, Oxford University, 1924–43. Chatham House conducted research for the British Foreign Office and was an important intellectual resource during World War II when it was transferred to London. With his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, Toynbee was co-editor of the RIIA's annual ''Survey of International Affairs,'' which became the "bible" for international specialists in Britain.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Meeting with Adolf Hitler===
While on a visit in Berlin in 1936 to address the Nazi Law Society, Toynbee was invited to have a private interview with [[Adolf Hitler]], at Hitler's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brody |first=J. Kenneth |title=The Avoidable War—Volume 2: Pierre Laval and the Politics of Reality, 1935–1936 |date=1 October 1999 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0765806222|title-link=Pierre Laval }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler emphasized his limited expansionist aim of building a greater German nation, and his desire for British understanding and cooperation. Toynbee believed that Hitler was sincere and endorsed Hitler's message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989ch8&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Russia===
Toynbee was troubled by the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], for he saw Russia as a non-Western society and the revolution as a threat to Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paquette |first=Gabriel B. |title=The Impact of the 1917 Russian Revolutions on Arnold J.

He portrayed the Cold War as  a religious competition that pitted a Marxist materialist heresy against the West's spiritual Christian heritage—a heritage that had already been foolishly rejected by a secularized West. A heated debate ensued; an editorial in ''The Times'' promptly attacked Toynbee for treating communism as a "spiritual force".&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p464-5&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Greece and the Middle East===
Toynbee was a leading analyst of developments in the Middle East.  His support for Greece and hostility to the Turks during World War I had gained him an appointment to the Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History at [[King's College London|King's College, University of London]].&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"/&gt; However, after the war he changed to a pro-Turkish position, accusing Greece's military government in occupied Turkish territory of atrocities and massacres. This earned him the enmity of the wealthy Greeks who had endowed the chair, and in 1924 he was forced to resign the position.

His stance during World War I reflected less sympathy for the Arab cause and took a pro-Zionist outlook. He also expressed support for a [[Jewish State]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which he believed had "begun to recover its ancient prosperity" as a result. Toynbee investigated [[Zionism]] in 1915 at the Information Department of the Foreign Office, and in 1917 he published a memorandum with his colleague [[Lewis Namier]] which supported exclusive Jewish political rights in Palestine. In 1922, however, he was influenced by the Palestine Arab delegation which was visiting London, and began to adopt their views. His subsequent writings reveal his changing outlook on the subject, and by the late 1940s he had moved away from the Zionist cause and toward the Arab camp.

The views Toynbee expressed in the 1950s continued to oppose the formation of a Jewish state, partly out of his concern that it would increase the risk of a nuclear confrontation. However, as a result of Toynbee's debate in January 1961 with Dr. [[Yaakov Herzog]], the Israeli ambassador to Canada, Toynbee softened his view and called on Israel to fulfill its special "mission to make contributions to worldwide efforts to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Isaiah |title=Arnold Toynbee: Pro-Arab or Pro-Zionist? |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html |date=Spring 1999 |journal=Israel Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1353/is.1999.0019 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=This is how we ruined Toynbee's theory |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/this-is-how-we-ruined-toynbee-s-theory-1.210993|newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=19 December 2014|date=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Jewish Rights in Palestine",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453271|title = Jewish Rights in Palestine|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 1|last1 = Toynbee|first1 = Arnold J|doi = 10.2307/1453271|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; he challenged the views of the editor of the [[Jewish Quarterly Review]], historian and talmudic scholar [[Solomon Zeitlin]], who published his rebuke, "Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453272|title = Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 12|last1 = Zeitlin|first1 = Solomon|doi = 10.2307/1453272|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Rights in Palestine (pp. 1-11); Arnold J.

{{quote|"population’s human rights to their homes and property over-ride all other rights in cases where claims conflict." He did concede that the Jews, "being the only surviving representatives of any of the pre-Arab inhabitants of Palestine, have a further claim to a national home in Palestine." But that claim, he held, is valid "only in so far as it can be implemented without injury to the rights and to the legitimate interests of the native Arab population of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jta.org/1961/12/01/archive/prof-toynbee-rebuked-by-u-s-scholar-for-renewed-attack-on-jews | title=Prof. Toynbee Rebuked by U.S. Scholar for Renewed Attack on Jews| date=December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dialogue with Daisaku Ikeda===
In 1972, Toynbee met with [[Daisaku Ikeda]], president of [[Soka Gakkai International]] (SGI), who condemned the "demonic nature" of the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Toynbee had the view that the atomic bomb was an invention that had caused warfare to escalate from a political scale to catastrophic proportions and threatened humanity's very existence. In his dialogue with Ikeda, Toynbee stated his worry that humankind would not be able to strengthen ethical behavior and achieve self-mastery "in spite of the widespread awareness that the price of failing to respond to the moral challenge of the atomic age may be the self-liquidation of our species."

The two men first met on 5 May 1972 in London. In May 1973, Ikeda again flew to London to meet with Toynbee for 40 hours over a period of 10 days. Their dialogue and ongoing correspondence culminated in the publication of ''Choose Life'', a record of their views on critical issues confronting humanity. The book has been published in 24 languages to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choose Life—Arnold Toynbee and Daisaku Ikeda" Exhibition Opens in Hiroshima |url=http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |date=23 July 2005 |website=[[Soka Gakkai|Soka Gakkai International]] |accessdate=13 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053522/http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toynbee also wrote the foreword to the English edition of Ikeda's best-known book, ''The Human Revolution'', which has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=humanrevolution&gt;{{cite book |last=Ikeda |first=Daisaku |authorlink= |title=The Human Revolution |location=Santa Monica |publisher=World Tribune Press |year=2004 |at=Preface |isbn=978-0915678778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition celebrating the 30th anniversary of Toynbee and Ikeda's first meeting was presented in SGI's centers around the world in 2005, showcasing contents of the dialogues between them, as well as Ikeda's discussions for peace with over 1,500 of the world's scholars, intellects, and activists. Original letters Toynbee and Ikeda exchanged were also displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thirtieth Anniversary of Toynbee-Ikeda Dialogue |url=http://www.sgiquarterly.org/news2003Jan-4.html |journal=SGI Quarterly |date=January 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 his granddaughter [[Polly Toynbee]] wrote a critical article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' on meeting Daisaku Ikeda.&lt;ref name=ToynbeeP1984&gt;{{cite news |last=Toynbee |first=Polly |title=The Value of a Grandfather Figure |newspaper=[[Manchester Guardian]] |date=19 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge and response&lt;!--'Toynbee's law of challenge and response' redirects here--&gt;==
With the civilizations as units identified, he presented the history of each in terms of challenge-and-response, sometimes referred to as theory about the law of challenge and response. Civilizations arose in response to some set of challenges of extreme difficulty, when "creative minorities" devised solutions that reoriented their entire society. Challenges and responses were physical, as when the [[Sumer]]ians exploited the intractable swamps of southern [[Iraq]] by organizing the Neolithic inhabitants into a society capable of carrying out large-scale irrigation projects; or social, as when the Catholic Church resolved the chaos of post-Roman Europe by enrolling the new Germanic kingdoms in a single religious community. When a civilization responded to challenges, it grew. Civilizations disintegrate when their leaders stopped responding creatively, and the civilizations then sank owing to nationalism, militarism, and the tyranny of a despotic minority. According to an Editor's Note in an edition of Toynbee's ''A Study of History,'' Toynbee believed that societies always die from suicide or murder rather than from natural causes, and nearly always from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J. Toynbee|title=A Study of History: Abridgement of Volumes I to VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbJ-31LPvyoC&amp;pg=PA273|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199826698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees the growth and decline of civilizations as a spiritual process, writing that "Man achieves civilization, not as a result of superior biological endowment or geographical environment, but as a response to a challenge in a situation of special difficulty which rouses him to make a hitherto unprecedented effort." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Snooks|title=The Laws of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vkvMpiag-gC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=91|isbn=9780203452448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J.

==Toynbee Prize Foundation==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Named after Arnold J. Toynbee, the [Toynbee Prize] Foundation was chartered in 1987 'to contribute to the development of the [[social sciences]], as defined from a broad historical view of human society and of human and social problems.' In addition to awarding the Toynbee Prize, the foundation sponsors scholarly engagement with global history through sponsorship of sessions at the annual meeting of the [[American Historical Association]], of international conferences, of the  journal ''New Global Studies'' and of the Global History Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Toynbee Prize Foundation |url=http://toynbeeprize.org/toynbee-prize-foundation/ |publisher=Toynbee Foundation |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Toynbee Prize is an honorary award, recognizing social scientists for significant [[academic]] and public contributions to humanity. Currently, it is awarded every other year for work that makes a significant contribution to the study of global history. The recipients have been [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lord Kenneth Clark]], Sir [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], [[Bruce Mazlish]], [[John McNeill (botanist)|John McNeill]], [[William McNeill (historian)|William McNeill]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Barbara Ward]], [[Lady Jackson]], [[Sir Brian Urquhart]], [[Michael Adas]], [[Christopher Bayly]], and [[Jürgen Osterhammel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toynbeeprize.org/global-history-blog/the-2017-toynbee-prize-lecture-arnold-toynbee-and-the-problems-of-today-jurgen-osterhammel/|title=The 2017 Toynbee Prize Lecture: "Arnold Toynbee and the Problems of Today" (Jürgen Osterhammel) {{!}} Toynbee Prize Foundation|website=toynbeeprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Toynbee's ideas also feature in the [[Ray Bradbury]] [[short story]] named "[[The Toynbee Convector]]". He appears alongside [[T. E. Lawrence]] as a character in an episode of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', dealing with the post-[[World War I]] treaty negotiations at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]].  He also receives a brief mention in the [[Charles Harness]] classic, ''The Paradox Men'' (a working title was ''Toynbee 22''). [[Frederick Buechner]] also mentions him in the 1957 novel ''The return of Ansel Gibbs''. Most versions of the ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' computer game refer to his work as a historian as well. Toynbee receives mention in Pat Frank's post-apocalyptic novel "[[Alas, Babylon]]". A character in the P. Schuyler Miller short story "As Never Was" adopts the name Toynbee "out of admiration for a historian of that name". He is also mentioned in the [[Tom Robbins]] novel, ''[[Another Roadside Attraction]]''. The [[Toynbee tiles]] may be a reference to Toynbee.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30331">The '''Bancroft Prize''' is awarded each year by the trustees of [[Columbia University]] for books about [[diplomacy]] or the history of the [[Americas]]. It was established in 1948 by a bequest from [[Frederic Bancroft]].  The prize has been generally considered to be among the most prestigious awards{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in the field of American history writing and comes with a $10,000 stipend (raised from $4,000 beginning in 2004).  Seventeen winners had their work supported by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and 16 winners were also recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neh.gov/projects/prizewinners.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was affected by the post-award controversy involving the scholarship of [[Michael A. Bellesiles]], who received the prize for his work in 2001. Following independent investigations, Columbia University rescinded the prize for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">{{short description|Theory of continuous nonconformist Christian Church}}
'''Baptist successionism''' (or '''Baptist perpetuity''') is one of several theories on the [[Baptists#Origins|origin and continuation of Baptist churches]]. The theory postulates an unbroken lineage of churches (since the days of [[John the Baptist]], who baptized [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]) which have held beliefs similar to those of current [[Baptists]]. Groups often included in this lineage include the [[Montanists]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], [[Cathari]], [[Waldenses]], [[Albigenses]], and [[Anabaptist]]s.{{sfn|Patterson|1969|p= 9}}

== Articulation of the theory ==

[[File:The Trail of Blood.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Diagram representing ''[[The Trail of Blood]]'' as presented by [[James Milton Carroll]]]]
The perpetuity view is often identified with ''[[The Trail of Blood]]'', a pamphlet by [[James Milton Carroll]] published in 1931.{{sfn|McBeth|1987|pp=59–60}} Other Baptist writers who held the perpetuity view are [[John T. Christian]], [[Thomas Crosby (Baptist)|Thomas Crosby]], G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray.{{sfnm |1a1=McBeth |1y=1987 |1pp=59–60 |2a1=Torbet |2y=1975 |2p=18}}

This view was once commonly held among Baptists.{{sfn|Torbet|1975|p=18}} Since the end of the 19th century, however, the theory has increasingly come under attack and today has been largely discredited.{{sfnm |1a1=Brackney |1y=2004 |2a1=McGoldrick |2y=2000}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}} Nonetheless, the view continued to be the prevailing view among Baptists of the [[Southern United States]] into the latter 20th century.{{sfn|Patterson|1969|p=6}} It is now identified primarily with [[Landmarkism]], though not exclusively so.{{sfnm |1a1=McBeth |1y=1987 |1p=58 |2a1=Patterson |2y=1969 |2p=6}} The concept finds its parallels in the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] doctrine of [[apostolic succession]] and stands in contrast to the restorationist views of [[Mormons|Latter Day Saints]] and the [[Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].{{sfn|Torbet|1975|p=19}}

== Modern rejection of the theory ==

Since the end of the 19th century the trend in academic Baptist [[historiography]] has been away from the successionist viewpoint to the view that modern day Baptists are an outgrowth of 17th-century [[English Separatist|English Separatism]].{{sfn|Cross|1990|p=174}} This shift precipitated a controversy among [[Southern Baptists]] which occasioned the [[Southern Baptist Convention#Whitsitt controversy|forced resignation of William H. Whitsitt]], a professor at [[Southern Baptist Seminary]], in 1898 from the seminary for advocating the new view, though his views continued to be taught in the seminary after his departure.{{sfn|McBeth|1987|pp=457–458}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Chronological synchronism''' is an event that links two [[chronology|chronologies]]. For example, it is used in [[Egyptology]] to ground [[Egyptian chronology]]. The main types of chronological synchronism are synchronisms with other historical chronologies and synchronisms with precisely datable astronomical events.

Synchronisms with other chronologies often rely on some form of recorded communication between regions. For example, in Egyptology, the earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC, during the [[Amarna Period]] by the considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Akhenaten]] and various [[Near Eastern]] monarchs; that links Egyptian chronology with other Near Eastern chronologies.

Astronomical synchronisms rely on precise identification of astronomical events recorded in the historical record. The best known of these is the [[Sothic cycle]] whose careful study led [[Richard Anthony Parker]] to argue that the dates of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] could be fixed with absolute precision.&lt;ref&gt;Set forth in "Excursus C: The Twelfth dynasty" in his ''The Calendars of ancient Egypt'' (Chicago: University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has eroded that confidence and questioned many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle. As a result, experts have moved away from relying on it.&lt;ref&gt;One example is Patrick O'Mara, "Censorinus, the Sothic Cycle, and calendar year one in ancient Egypt: the Epistological problem", ''Journal of Near Eastern studies'', '''62''' (2003), pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural globalization''' refers to the transmission of ideas,
meanings, and [[values]] around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify [[social relation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of [[culture]]s that have been diffused by the [[Internet]], [[popular culture]] media, and [[international travel]]. This has added to processes of [[commodities exchange|commodity exchange]] and [[colonization]] which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural [[globalization]] involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism, Sage Publications, London, 2010. download pdf https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames {{Cite book|last1=Inda |first1=Jonathan |last2=Rosaldo |first2=Renato |title=The Anthropology of Globalization |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of Cultural Globalization ==

=== Overview ===

* Diffusion of ideas and cultures amongst all of the civilizations of the world.
* Trend that will eventually make all of human experience and customs the same since all cultures are coming together into one
* Occurs in everyday life, through wireless communication, electronic commerce, popular culture and international trade
* Attempt to promote a Western lifestyle and possibly Americanize the world.

=== Contributing Factors ===

* New technology and forms of communication around the world help to integrate different cultures into each other 
* Transportation technologies and services along with mass migration and individual travel contribute to this form of globalization allowing for cross-cultural exchanges
* Infrastructures and institutionalization embedded change (e.g. teaching languages such as English across the world through educational systems and training of teachers)

=== Benefits ===

* Allows for profits to companies and nations
* Offers opportunities for development and advancement in economics, technology, and information and usually impacts developed countries
* Creates a more homogeneous world
* Generates interdependent companies amongst companies

== Phases of Cultural Globalization    ==

=== Pre-modern Phase of Globalization (early civilizations to 1500) ===

* Early human migration (facilitation of trade and creation of social networks amongst other nations)
* Emergence of world religions
* Development of trans-regional trade networks (long distance trade, many centered in China and India. Early forms of globalization, especially with the Silk Route which linked the Roman Empire and the Chinese Han Empire

=== Modern Phase of Globalization ===

* European imperialism (rise of the West. European expansionism, especially with Columbus’ encounter with the New World which allowed goods and people to cross the Atlantic)
* Emerging international economy
* International migration and developments outside of the West
* Spread of modernity
* Rise of nation-state (a development of freedom of movement and cultural diffusion. 
* Industrialization (demand for raw materials to supply industries. Science grew immensely with electronic shipping, railways, and new forms of communication, such as cable technology

=== Contemporary Phase of Globalization (1945- Present) ===

* Struggle after cold war led to a slow but steady increase in cultural flows with the immigration of peoples, ideas, goods, symbols and images. 
* Represented global cultural interconnectedness, which eventually led to developments in transport and transport infrastructures such as jet airlines, construction of road and rail networks. This allowed for more tourism and shifting patterns of global migration.
* Marshall McLuhan introduced the term “global village” in the 1960s stating that it was the ability to connect and trade ideas instantly amongst the nations of the world
* The term “globalization” became popular in the 1980s

== Examples of Cultural Globalization ==

Cultural globalization integrates scholars from several disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, communication, cultural studies, geography, political science and international relations. The field is notably broad as there are several concepts which may be perceived as cultural or transnational.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Crane, D. (2011) Cultural globalization: 2001–10, University of Pennsylvania. Available from: sociopedia.isa [6 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

A visible aspect of the cultural globalization is the diffusion of certain cuisines such as American [[fast food chain]]s. The two most successful global food and beverage outlets, [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]], are American companies often cited as examples of globalization, with over 36,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390816000103/mcd-12312015x10k.htm|title=2015 Form 10-K, McDonald's Corporation|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 24,000 locations operating worldwide respectively as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Steger, Manfred.''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ExsTX8z4j8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=globalization&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Globalization]''. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Mac Index]] is an informal measure of purchasing power parity among world currencies.

Cultural globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike economic and political globalization, cultural globalization has not been the subject of extensive research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Measurement==

There have been numerous attempts to measure globalization, typically using indices that capture quantitative data for [[trade flows]], [[political integration]], and other measures.  The two most prominent are the AT Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization index and the KOF Globalization Index.  Cultural globalization, however, is much more difficult to capture using quantitative data, because it is difficult to find easily verifiable data of the flow of ideas, opinions, and [[fashion]]s.  One attempt to do so was the Cultural Globalization Index, proposed by Randolph Kluver and Wayne Fu in 2004, and initially published by Foreign Policy Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Kluver, R., &amp; Fu, W. (2004). The cultural globalization index. In Foreign Policy Magazine. Available online: https://foreignpolicy.com/2004/02/10/the-cultural-globalization-index/&lt;/ref&gt;  This effort measured cultural flow by using global trade in media products (books, periodicals, and newspapers) as a proxy for cultural flow.  Kluver and Fu followed up with an extended analysis, using this method to measure cultural globalization in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Kluver, R., &amp; Fu, W. (2008). Measuring cultural globalization in Southeast Asia. In T. Chong (Ed.), Globalisation and its counter-forces in Southeast Asia. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. [https://www.academia.edu/download/31540811/measuring_cult_globalization_in_SE_Asia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of Cultural Globalization ==
The patterns of cultural globalization is a way of spreading theories and ideas from one place to another. Although globalization has affected us economically and politically, it has also affected us socially on a wider scale. With the inequalities issues, such as race, ethnic and class systems, social inequalities plays a part within those categories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahay|first=Vijoy|date=2013|title=Globalization, Urbanization and Migration:Anthropological Dimensions of Trends and Impacts|url=|journal=Oriental Anthropologists|volume=13|pages=305–312|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past half-century has witnessed a trend towards globalization. Within the media and pop culture, it has shaped individuals to have certain attitudes that involve race issues thus leading to stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Technology is an impact that created a bridge that diffused the globalization of culture. It brings together [[globalization]], [[urbanization]] and [[Human migration|migration]] and how it has affected today's trends. Before urban centers had developed, the idea of globalization after the second world war was that globalization took place due to the lifting of state restrictions by different nations. There were national boundaries for the flow of goods and services, concepts and ideas.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Hybridization===

Many writers suggest that cultural globalization is a long-term historical process of bringing different cultures into interrelation. Jan Pieterse suggested that cultural globalization involves human integration and hybridization, arguing that it is possible to detect cultural mixing across continents and regions going back many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jan N. |last=Pieterse |title=Globalization and Culture |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refer, for example, to the movement of religious practices, language and culture brought by [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The Indian experience, to take another example, reveals both the pluralization of the impact of cultural globalization and its long-term history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=Biswajit |year=2011 |title=Cultural changes in the era of globalisation |journal=Journal of Developing Societies |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=153–175 |doi=10.1177/0169796x1102700203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of such cultural historians qualifies the lineage of writers—predominantly economists and sociologists—who trace the origins of globalization to recent [[capitalism]], facilitated through technological advances.

===Homogenization===

An alternative perspective on cultural globalization emphasizes the transfiguration of worldwide diversity into a pandemic of Westernized [[consumer culture]].&lt;ref name="Kraidy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |title=Hybridity, or the Cultural Logic of Globalization |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2005 |pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that the dominance of American culture influencing the entire world will ultimately result in the end of [[cultural diversity]]. Such cultural globalization may lead to a human monoculture.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffe|first1=Eugene D.|title=Globalization and Development|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438123318|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b5EnlzZSK4QC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Monoculture+globalization#v=onepage&amp;q=Monoculture%20globalization&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jansson|first1=Bruce S.|title=Becoming an Effective Policy Advocate|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495812395|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OmkE7Zs91uMC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Monoculture+globalization#v=onepage&amp;q=Monoculture%20globalization&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, understood as [[cultural imperialism]],&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson (1999). Globalization and Culture. Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} is associated with the destruction of cultural identities, dominated by a homogenized and westernized, consumer culture. The global influence of American products, businesses and culture in other countries around the world has been referred to as [[Americanization]]. This influence is represented through that of American-based television programs which are rebroadcast throughout the world. Major American companies such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have played a major role in the spread of American culture around the globe. Terms such as [[Coca-colonization]] have been coined to refer to the dominance of American products in foreign countries, which some critics of globalization view as a threat to the cultural identity of these nations.

===Conflict intensification===

Another alternative perspective argues that in reaction to the process of cultural globalization, a "[[Clash of Civilizations]]" might appear. Indeed, [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] emphasizes the fact that while the world is becoming smaller and interconnected, the interactions between peoples of different cultures enhance the civilization consciousness that in turn invigorate differences. Indeed, rather than reaching a global cultural community, the differences in culture sharpened by this very process of cultural globalization will be a source of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=The Clash of Civilizations|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=1993|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22–3, 25–32, 39–41, 49|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not many commentators agree that this should be characterized as a 'Clash of Civilizations', there is general concurrence that cultural globalization is an ambivalent process bringing an intense sense of local difference and ideological contestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2010 | author= Paul James and Manfred Steger | title= Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism | url= https://www.academia.edu/4510893 | publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Benjamin Barber]] in his book ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'' argues for a different "cultural division" of the world. In his book the McWorld represents a world of globalization and global connectivity and [[interdependence]], looking to create a "commercially homogeneous global network". This global network is divided into four imperatives; [[Market (economics)|Market]], [[Resource]], [[information technology|Information-Technology]] and the [[Ecological]] imperative. On the other hand, "[[Jihad]]" represents traditionalism and maintaining one's identity. Whereas "Clash of Civilizations" portrays a world with five coalitions of nation-states, "Jihad vs. McWorld" shows a world where struggles take place on a sub-national level. Although most of the western nations are capitalist and can be seen as "McWorld" countries, societies within these nations might be considered "Jihad" and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Lechner and John Boli., ''The Globalization Reader: Fourth Edition'', Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">The '''[[Klondike Gold Rush#Culture|Klondike Gold Rush]]''' is commemorated through film, literature, historical parks etc.

==Literature==
[[File:Jim Mason plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque to Skookum Jim Mason]]
Amongst the many to take part in the gold rush was writer [[Jack London]], whose books ''[[White Fang]]'', ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', and ''[[To Build a Fire]]'', a collection of short stories, were influenced by his northern experiences. London was inspired to write stories by various adventurers he met. ''The Thousand Dozen'' for instance was inspired by a brief market corner on eggs created by [[Bill Gates (frontiersman)|"Swiftwater" Bill Gates]]. Part I of Jack London's 1910 novel ''Burning Daylight'' is centered on the Klondike Gold Rush. Another literary luminary connected with the rush, and whose cabin still stands in Dawson City, was folk-lyricist [[Robert W. Service]], whose short epics [[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]] and other works describe the fierce grandeur of the north and the survival ethic and gold fever of men and women in the frozen, gold-strewn north. Service's best-known line is the opening of [[The Cremation of Sam McGee]], which goes;

:''There are strange things done in the midnight sun
:''By the men who moil for gold;

One of the last books of [[Jules Verne]], ''Le Volcan d'Or'' (''The Volcano of Gold''), deals with the terrible hardships endured by the gold-seekers in the Klondike. The book was written circa 1899 but was not published until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dumas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVidJFp26oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22the+golden+volcano%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nUzs9QiCer&amp;sig=dinajx-4HX_UHKRbCGIRfI6cEnY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9tiPS-2HHI3SsgO9t_yfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Preface to ''The Golden Volcano''], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James A. Michener]]'s novel ''[[Alaska (novel)|Alaska]]'' (chapter VIII) and his short novel ''Journey'' describe the harsh realities of the Klondike Gold Rush using fictional characters.

[[Image:TheGoldRush.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] carving up a boot in ''[[The Gold Rush]]'']]  The 1997 book "Jason's Gold" by [[Will Hobbs]] (not published until 1999) was about a boy who went to Klondike in search for gold and his experience there.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Will. ''Jason's Gold'', HarperCollins, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian author [[Vicki Delany]] writes the Klondike Gold Rush series of mystery novels from Dundurn Press, which include '''Gold Digger''' (2009) and '''Gold Fever''' (2010) and '''Gold Mountain''' (May 2012)

==Film and television==
[[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), the highest grossing silent comedy, was set in the Klondike, as was the silent epic ''[[The Trail of '98]]'' (1928) and [[Mae West]]'s ''[[Klondike Annie]]'' (1936). A silent-era film by Russian director [[Lev Kuleshov]] ''By the Law'' (1926), based on [[Jack London]]'s story "The Unexpected" also dramatizes the life of the gold-seekers.

The 1946 comedy, ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' is set during the Rush. 

Life in Dawson City during the gold rush was also the subject of the award-winning 1957 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) documentary ''[[City of Gold (1957 film)|City of Gold]]'', narrated by Pierre Berton.

The 1955 film''[[The Far Country]]'' is a Western set in Skagway and Dawson City during the gold rush era. It was directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and written by [[Borden Chase]]. The 1978 [[Television|TV]] [[Television special|special]] ''[[What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown!]]'' is also set during the Gold Rush but is disputed to be the [[1925 serum run to Nome]].

The [[Irish language]] TV series ''[[An Klondike]]'' (2015) also takes place during the Rush.

==Music and Theater==
The ''Klondyke march and two step'' with music by [[Oscar Telgmann]] was published in [[Kingston, Ontario]] by the Music Emporium, c. 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/m5-bin/Main/ItemDisplay?l=0&amp;l_ef_l=-1&amp;id=544315.1058422&amp;v=1&amp;lvl=1&amp;coll=17&amp;rt=1&amp;itm=23831798&amp;rsn=S_WWWbeaPPbvVu&amp;all=1&amp;dt=AW+%7cTelgmann%7c&amp;spi=-&amp;rp=1&amp;vo=1 |title=Klondyke march and two step |publisher=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dawson City was also the starting place of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]]. He opened a small theater to entertain the miners. He also became the partner and lover of [["Klondike Kate" Rockwell]]. Soon, however, his activities expanded and he became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons.

The song "Gold Dust" by Canadian independent artist Right On Yukon makes multiple references to the hardships endured by fortune seekers and animals along the White Pass trail from Skagway to Dawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightonyukon.bandcamp.com/track/gold-dust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Back to the Klondike.png|thumb|Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck comics established the character as a participant in the Klondike rush. Cover to the Carl Barks story ''[[Back to the Klondike]]'', Uncle Scrooge #2, 1952. Art by Carl Barks]] --&gt;[[Carl Barks]]' 1950s [[Scrooge McDuck]] comics established the character as a successful participant in the Klondike rush when he was young, around the turn of the century. While Barks was content with leaving Scrooge's backstory of his Klondike days at the level of short flashbacks, his successor [[Don Rosa]] has gone to extend Barks's legacy of short glimpses into Scrooge's gold rush exploits into a number of adventure stories, particularly ''Last Sled to Dawson'' and individual chapters of his opus magnum ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', which are chapter 8a: ''[[King of the Klondike]]'', chapter 8b: ''[[The Prisoner of White Agony Creek]]'', and chapter 8c: ''Hearts of the Yukon''.

Soapy Smith is the villain in the [[Lucky Luke]] album ''Le Klondike'', by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], Yann and Jean Léturgie. The story features Smith's saloon and fake telegraph, but set in Dawson rather than Skagway.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Lefty Frizzell]]'s 1964 song [[Saginaw, Michigan (song)|"Saginaw, Michigan"]] tells the tale of a poor fisherman who feigns the discovery of Klondike gold in a plot to remove the hostile father of the woman he loves.

A game called [[The Yukon Trail]] was created by [[MECC]] in 1994. There is also a populaire solitaire called [[Klondike (solitaire)|Klondike]].

In addition, the Klondike gold rush proved to be one of the most famous eras of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's history. Not only did the exemplary conduct of the force ensure its continuation at a time when its dissolution was being debated in the [[Parliament of Canada]], but the Force's depiction in popular western culture is often set at this time. The most popular examples include dramatic depictions such as the radio series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'' and comedic ones like ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]''.

A certain amount of [[slang]] came out of the gold rush. Experienced miners were often known as [[Sourdough]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sourdough |title=Merriam-Webster online – Sourdough |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential miners new to the Klondike  were known as Cheechakos, from [[Chinook Jargon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheechakos |title=Merriam-Webster online – Cheechakos |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two names live on in Dawson City, in tourist literature, and enjoy occasional usage by miners still working the tributaries of the Yukon River and Klondike River as well as in literature relating to the Klondike gold rush era.

==Celebrations==
The gold rush was celebrated in the city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], with [[K-Days|Klondike Days]] (now simply K-Days), an annual summer fair with a Klondike gold rush theme. Although far away from Dawson City and the Klondike River, Edmonton became known as a "Gateway to the North" for gold prospectors en route to Canada's North. It was in the city that many would collect the necessary goods for trekking up north in search of wealth. Individuals and teams of explorers arrived in Edmonton and prepared for travel by foot, [[York boat]], [[Sled dog|dog team]], or horses. Travel to the Yukon over land via what was sometimes called the "all Canada" route—and the prospectors that took this route—were often referred to as "overlanders". Few overlanders made it to the Klondike (160 out of about 1,600 that started&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm Chalmers Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812143900/http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm |date=2009-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Alberta's Northlands Association, which is based in Edmonton, honoured the memory and spirit of the overlanders with Klondike Days. For many years, Klondike Days was a fun summer exhibition with themed events such as the Sunday Promenade, the Sourdough raft race, free pancake breakfasts, saloons, gold panning and era costume parties.  Despite the many sad realities of the gold rush, Edmonton appreciated the Klondike spirit, which was characterised by a tenacious hope for success in the face of hardship, and an energetic zest for life. As a fair theme it was meant to provide the impetus for fun fantasy characters (e.g., Klondike Mike (Bobby Breen), Klondike Kate, The Klondike Kid (Ken Armstrong), Klondike Kitty (Debra Cook), Klondike Kattie to mention but a few) and fun events celebrating an interesting time. Many in the Yukon resented Edmonton's Klondike celebrations because of their historical inaccuracy and the perceived competition with the Yukon's tourism. The sentimental aspect of the gold rush lost its popular appeal in the 1980s and 90s and in 2003 the theme was dropped.

In addition, every other summer, on odd numbered years, the sleep away camp Camp Shohola for Boys has what it calls Klondike Day. In the morning an area of camp, including the creek that runs through the camp, are staged as Dawson City and campers run into the creek to search for "gold." In the afternoon they receive "money" for their prospecting and attend a camp wide carnival.

'''''Der Landser''''' (literally ''private, common soldier'') was a German [[pulp magazine]] published by Pabel-Moewig and featuring mostly stories in [[World War II]] settings. The magazine was founded in 1954&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt; by writer and former [[Luftwaffe]] officer {{illm|Bertold K. Jochim|de|Bertold K. Jochim}} (1921-2002), who worked as its editor-in-chief until 1999. In September 2013 the [[Bauer Media Group]], its last owner, ceased publishing the magazine.&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacke&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Ewing|title=German Magazine Said to Glorify Nazis Will End|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/world/europe/german-magazine-said-to-glorify-nazis-will-cease-publication.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=The New York Times|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine asserted that its war stories were true and that their underlying message was one of peace. In fact many of their stories came with disclaimer reminding the reader of the horrors of war. Critics however dismissed such claims as pure lip service to avoid getting [[Bibliographic index|index]]ed by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] which started to index several of their editions in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Bochmann: ''[http://www.bundespruefstelle.de/bmfsfj/generator/bpjm/redaktion/PDF-Anlagen/bpjm-aktuell-jugendgefaehrdende-medien-im-rechtsextremismus-aus-sicht-der-bpjm-aus-02-06,property=pdf,bereich=bpjm,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf Jugendgefährdende Medien im Rechtsextremismus aus Sicht der BPJM (PDF)]''. S.1. Jahrestagung 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding the magazine was criticized for glorifying war and delivering a distorted image of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. The content of novels was accurate regarding minor technical details, but its descriptions were often not authentic and withheld important contextual information from the reader. Antisemitism, German war crimes, the repressive nature of the German government, and the causes of the war were not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Torben Fischer, Matthias N. Lorenz: ''Lexikon der "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" in Deutschland: Debatten- und Diskursgeschichte des Nationalsozialismus nach 1945''. transcript Verlag 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-89942-773-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;116 ({{Google books|1-nQ4CzC95YC|online copy|page=116}}) (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's leading news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described ''Der Landser'' once as the expert journal for the whitewashing of the Wehrmacht ("Fachorgan für die Verklärung der Wehrmacht").&lt;ref name="spiegel98"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7955989.html?name=Kampferprobte+Verb%26auml%3Bnde ''Kampferprobte Verbände'']. In DER SPIEGEL 32/1998 3 August 1998, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher of the magazine was Pabel Moewig, a subsidiary of [[Bauer Media Group]].&lt;ref name=cardw/&gt; In September 2013 Bauer Media Group said it would cease publication of ''Der Landser'' following complaints from the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]].&lt;ref name=jacke/&gt; The magazine was closed down 13 September 2013.&lt;ref name=cardw&gt;{{cite news|author=Carla Bleiker|title=Publishing house terminates German pulp mag 'Der Landser'|url=http://www.dw.de/publishing-house-terminates-german-pulp-mag-der-landser/a-16989362|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=Deutsche Welle|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">A '''fainting room''' was a private room, of which its main features/furniture were [[fainting couch]]es, used during the [[Victorian era]], to make women more comfortable during the home treatment of [[female hysteria]]. Fainting rooms were used for more privacy during home treatment [[erotic massage#Use in medicine|pelvic massage]]s. Such couches or sofas typically had an arm on one side only to permit easy access to a reclining position, similar to its cousin the [[Chaise longue]], although the sofa style most typically featured a back at one end (usually the side with the arm) so that the resulting position was not purely [[supine position|supine]]. 

There are also accounts that mention fainting rooms in eighteenth-century America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Haunted Crown Point, Indiana|last=Tometczak|first=Judith|publisher=The History Press|year=2017|isbn=9781467136914|location=Charleston, SC|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; This room, which was also referred to as bedroom (bedrooms were called chambers), is located in the ground floor and contained a day bed that allow occupants to rest for brief periods during the day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Theories for the prevalence of fainting couches==
One theory for the predominance of fainting couches is that women were actually fainting because their [[corsets]] were laced too tightly, thus restricting blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=You Can Beat the Odds: Surprising Factors Behind Chronic Illness and Cancer|last=Stockdale|first=Brenda|publisher=Sentient Publications|year=2009|isbn=9781591810797|location=Boulder, CO|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/living/health-fitness/article42228423.html|title=Get skinny in a cinch? Corsets make a comeback, along with health issues|last=Caiola|first=Sammy|date=2015-11-02|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, pictures from the 1860s show women horseback riding, playing tennis, and engaging in other vigorous activities in corsets without hindrance. This being stated, though, a tightly laced corset does restrict airflow to the lungs. As a result, if she exerted herself to the point of needing large quantities of oxygen, being unable to fully inflate the lungs could contribute to a light-headed state; exacerbating this state could surely lead to fainting. Alternatively, a high state of emotions could result in hyperventilation, potentially resulting in the same event.

The second most common{{OR|date=November 2016}} theory for the predominance of fainting couches is home treatment of female hysteria through manual pelvic massage by home visiting doctors and midwives.&lt;ref name="Maines"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-8018-6646-4|title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction|author=[[Rachel Maines|Rachel P. Maines]]|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a "disease" that needed constant, recurring (usually weekly) in-home treatment with a procedure that through manual massage could sometimes take hours, creating specialized furniture for maximum comfort during the extended procedure seems likely, as does the later creation of fainting rooms for privacy during the intimate massage procedure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Victorian fainting rooms are also associated with gender discrimination such as the claim that it is part of the legacy of female containment where such room served as a deeply female space meant to force women to remain indoors and inactive under the guise of ensuring privacy, class, and interiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ghosts in the Consulting Room: Echoes of Trauma in Psychoanalysis|last=Harris|first=Adrienne|last2=Kalb|first2=Margery|last3=Klebanoff|first3=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9780415728676|location=Oxon|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also associate it with the view that because women are so frail, they could not handle bad news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sdnews.com/view/full_story/27524201/article-Beauty-is-pain---but-is-it-torture--Women-s-Museum-of-California-exhibit-explores-that-question-?instance=most_popular1|title=Beauty is pain – but is it torture?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">A '''feud letter''' ({{lang-de|Fehdebrief}} or ''Absagebrief'') was a [[document]] in which a [[feud]] was announced – usually with few words - in medieval Europe. The letter had to be issued three days in advance in order to be legally valid.

So that the feud did not became a case of [[murder]] and thus become punishable by law, those involved had to abide by the following rules:

# The feud, whether between [[knight]]s or between the [[nobility]] and towns, had to be initiated by a formal feud letter
# The killing of innocent parties was forbidden
# The razing of houses and laying waste to the land was allowed
# During the feud, fighting was not permitted in churches or in the home, and the parties were to be allowed go to and return from church or court without being molested.

== Examples ==
* Around 1444, the town of [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] declared war on the [[Archbishop]] of [[Cologne]] at the start of the [[Soest Feud]] with the following famous, brief feud letter:

''"Wettet, biscop Dierich van Moeres, dat wy den vesten Junker Johan can Cleve lever hebbet alls Juwe, unde wert Juwe hiermit affgesaget"''&lt;br&gt;(''"Know this, Bishop Dietrich of Moers, that we prefer the steadfast [[Junker]], John of Cleves, to you, and hereby give you notice thereof."'')

A '''field coil loudspeaker''' is a [[dynamic loudspeaker]] in which the field is produced by an [[electromagnet]] rather than by a permanent magnet.

An electrodynamic loudspeaker therefore has two coils:

* The [[voice coil]] common to all dynamic y, positioned in the [[Voice coil#Design considerations|air gap]] between the [[pole piece]]s, the motion of which moves the [[loudspeaker cone]].
* A fixed [[field coil]] which together with its [[magnetic core]] replaces the permanent magnet of other dynamic loudspeakers.

The first electrodynamic loudspeakers were produced in the 1920s, to address the problem that strong permanent magnets of the time were extremely heavy. A compromise was therefore necessary between loudspeaker efficiency, which required the strongest possible magnet, and weight. The use of a strong but relatively light electromagnet solved this problem.

While now uncommon, field coil loudspeakers were once common in top quality console and tabletop [[radio]]s and similar domestic [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] applications, particularly from the late 20s to the [[post-war period]] of [[World War II]]. In these appliances the field coil of the loudspeaker was also used as the main or only [[filter choke]] in the [[HT (vacuum tube)|high tension]] [[power supply]] to the [[Vacuum tube|valve]] [[anode]]s.

Advances in [[permanent magnet]] technology rendered the traditional electrodynamic loudspeaker obsolete. The type survives in some high-end [[hi-fi]] applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1005">The '''Global Heritage Stone Resource''' (GHSR) designation seeks international recognition of natural stone resources that have achieved widespread utilisation in human culture.

Details of the “Global Heritage Stone Resource” proposal were first provided publicly at the 33rd [[International Geological Congress]] in Oslo in August 2008.

At the same conference it was agreed to advance the GHSR proposal under the auspices of “Commission C-10 Building Stones and Ornamental Rocks” of the [[International Association of Engineering Geology and the Environment|International Association for Engineering Geology and the Environment]] (IAEG).

Since the Oslo conference the designation has also gained support from the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS).

He is best known for his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' or ''Prolegomena'' ("Introduction").

Ibn Khaldun's life is relatively well-documented, as he wrote an [[autobiography]] ({{lang|ar|التعريف بابن خلدون ورحلته غربا وشرقا}}, ''{{transl|ar|at-Taʻrīf bi-ibn Khaldūn wa-Riḥlatih Gharban wa-Sharqan}}''&lt;ref&gt;Published by Muḥammad ibn Tāwīt aṭ-Ṭanjī, Cairo 1951&lt;/ref&gt;) ("''Presenting Ibn Khaldun and his Journey West and East''") in which numerous documents regarding his life are quoted word-for-word.

Abdurahman bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Al-Hasan bin Jabir bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abdurahman bin Ibn Khaldun, generally known as "Ibn Khaldūn" after a remote ancestor, was born in [[Tunis]] in AD 1332 (732 [[Anno hegirae|AH]]) into an upper-class [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] family of Arab descent,&lt;ref name="WP:BOMBARD" /&gt; the family's ancestor was, according to him, a [[Yemeni people|Yemeni]] Arab who shared kinship with [[Hujr ibn 'Adi|Waíl ibn Hujr]], a companion of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. His family, which held many high offices in [[Andalusia]], had emigrated to [[Tunisia]] after the fall of [[Seville]] to the [[Reconquista]] in AD 1248. Under the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]], some of his family held political office; his father and grandfather, however, withdrew from political life and joined a mystical order. His brother, Yahya Khaldun, was also a [[historian]] who wrote a book on the [[Abdalwadid]] dynasty and
was assassinated by a rival for being the official [[historiographer]] of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=blQpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=Zakariya+Yahya+Ibn+Khaldoun&amp;hl=fr#PPA491,M1 « Lettre à Monsieur Garcin de Tassy », ''Journal asiatique'', troisième série, tome XII, éd. Société asiatique, Paris, 1841, p. 491]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Khaldun traces his descent back to the time of Muhammad through an Arab tribe from [[Yemen]], specifically the [[Hadhramaut]], which came to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 8th century, at the beginning of the Islamic conquest: "And our ancestry is from Hadhramaut, from the Arabs of Yemen, via Wa'il ibn Hujr also known as [[Hujr ibn 'Adi]], from the best of the Arabs, well-known and respected." (p.&amp;nbsp;2429, Al-Waraq's edition). However, the biographer Mohammad Enan questions his claim and suggests that his family may have been [[Muladi]]s who pretended to be of Arab origin to gain social status.&lt;ref&gt;A., Khaldun: His life and Works for Mohammad Enan&lt;/ref&gt; Enan also mentions a well-documented past tradition that certain [[Berbers|Berber]] groups delusively "aggrandize" themselves with some Arab ancestry. The motive of such inventions was always the desire for political and societal ascendancy. Some speculate that of the Khaldun family and elaborate that Ibn Khaldun himself was the product of the same Berber ancestry as the native majority of his birthplace. A point supporting that posits that his unusual focus on and admiration Maharlika Berbers reveals a deference towards them that is born of a vested interest in preserving them in the realm of conscious history. Islamic scholar Muhammad Hozien contends, "The false [Berber] identity would be valid however at the time that Ibn Khaldun's ancestors left Andulsia and moved to Tunisia they did not change their claim to Arab ancestry. Even in the times when Berbers were ruling, the reigns of Al-Marabats and al-Mowahids, et. al. The Ibn Khalduns did not reclaim their Berber heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/knts.htm#n1|title=Notes on Ibn Khaludn's Life|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaldun's tracing of his own genealogy and surname are thought to be the strongest indication of Arab Yemenite ancestry.&lt;ref name="WP:BOMBARD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Muqqadimah.

== Education ==
His family's high rank enabled Ibn Khaldun to study with the best teachers in [[Maghreb]]. He received a classical [[Madrasah|Islamic education]], studying the [[Qur'an]], which he [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorized by heart]], [[Arabic language|Arabic linguistics]]; the basis for understanding the Qur'an, [[hadith]], [[sharia]] (law) and [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence). He received certification ([[ijazah]]) for all of those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muhammad Hozien|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Work|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm|publisher=Islamic Philosophy Online|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Al-Abili of [[Tlemcen]] introduced him to [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], and he studied especially the works of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]]. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldūn lost both his parents to the [[Black Death]], an intercontinental [[epidemic]] of the [[bubonic plague|plague]] that hit Tunis in 1348–1349.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200605/ibn.khaldun.and.the.rise.and.fall.of.empires.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World: Ibn Khaldun and the Rise and Fall of Empires|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.aramcoworld.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following family tradition, he strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, that required a high degree of skill in developing and dropping alliances prudently to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm|title=IBN KHALDUN – His Life and Work|website=www.muslimphilosophy.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Ibn Khaldūn's autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler Ibn Tafrakin with the position of ''Kātib al-'Alāmah'' (seal-bearer),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/ibn-khaldun-his-life-and-works|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=muslimheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of writing in fine [[calligraphy]] the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, Abū Ziad, the [[sultan]] of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn Khaldūn, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. There, the [[Marinid]] sultan, Abū Inan Fares I, appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, but Ibn Khaldūn still schemed against his employer, which, in 1357, got the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of Abū Inan in 1358, Vizier al-Hasān ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him to his rank and offices. Ibn Khaldūn then schemed against Abū Inan's successor, Abū Salem Ibrahim III, with Abū Salem's exiled uncle, Abū Salem. When Abū Salem came to power, he gave Ibn Khaldūn a ministerial position, the first position to correspond with Ibn Khaldūn's ambitions.

The treatment that Ibn Khaldun received after the fall of Abū Salem through Ibn-Amar ʻAbdullah, a friend of Ibn Khaldūn's, was not to his liking, as he received no significant official position. At the same time, Amar successfully prevented Ibn Khaldūn, whose political skills he knew well, from allying with the Abd al-Wadids in Tlemcen. Ibn Khaldūn, therefore, decided to move to [[Granada]]. He could be sure of a positive welcome there since at Fez, he had helped the Sultan of Granada, the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Muhammad V, regain power from his temporary exile. In 1364, Muhammad entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to the king of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Pedro of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]], to endorse a peace treaty. Ibn Khaldūn successfully carried out this mission and politely declined Pedro's offer to remain at his court and have his family's Spanish possessions returned to him.

In Granada, Ibn Khaldūn quickly came into competition with Muhammad's vizier, Ibn al-Khatib, who viewed the close relationship between Muhammad and Ibn Khaldūn with increasing mistrust. Ibn Khaldūn tried to shape the young Muhammad into his ideal of a wise ruler, an enterprise that Ibn al-Khatib thought foolish and a danger to peace in the country. History proved al-Khatib right, and at his instigation, Ibn Khaldūn was eventually sent back to North Africa. Al-Khatib himself was later accused by Muhammad of having unorthodox philosophical views and murdered despite an attempt by Ibn Khaldūn to intercede on behalf of his old rival.

In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldūn tells little about his conflict with Ibn al-Khatib and the reasons for his departure. Orientalist [[Muhsin Mahdi]] interprets that as showing that Ibn Khaldūn later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad V.

Back in Africa, the [[Hafsid]] sultan of [[Béjaïa|Bougie]], Abū ʻAbdallāh, who had been his companion in prison, received him with great enthusiasm and made Ibn Khaldūn his prime minister. Ibn Khaldūn carried out a daring mission to collect taxes among the local Berber tribes. After the death of Abū ʻAbdallāh in 1366, Ibn Khaldūn changed sides once again and allied himself with the [[Sultan of Tlemcen]], Abū l-Abbas. A few years later, he was taken prisoner by [[Abu Faris Abdul Aziz]], who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment and occupied himself with scholastic duties until 1370. In that year, he was sent for to Tlemcen by the new sultan. After the death of ʻAbdu l-Azīz, he resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.

Ibn Khaldūn's political skills and, above all, his good relationship with the wild Berber tribes were in high demand among the North African rulers, but he had begun to tire of politics and constantly switching allegiances. In 1375, he was sent by Abū Hammu, the ʻAbdu l Wadid Sultan of Tlemcen, on a mission to the Dawadida Arabs tribes of Biskra. After his return to the West, Ibn Khaldūn sought refuge with one of the Berber tribes in the west of [[Algeria]], in the town of [[Qalat Ibn Salama]]. He lived there for over three years under their protection, taking advantage of his seclusion to write the ''Muqaddimah'' "Prolegomena", the introduction to his planned history of the world. In Ibn Salama, however, he lacked the necessary texts to complete the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://alhassanain.org/english/?com=book&amp;id=1008|title=IBN KHALDUN'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REALISM|date=2016-03-26|publisher=google.com/+AlhassanainOrgNetwork|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in 1378, he returned to his native Tunis, which had meanwhile been conquered by Abū l-Abbas, who took Ibn Khaldūn back into his service. There, he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies and completed his history of the world. His relationship with Abū l-Abbas remained strained, as the latter questioned his loyalty. That was brought into sharp contrast after Ibn Khaldūn presented him with a copy of the completed history that omitted the usual [[panegyric]] to the ruler. Under pretence of going on the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]], something a Muslim ruler could not simply refuse permission for Ibn Khaldūn was able to leave Tunis and to sail to [[Alexandria]].

== Later life ==
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun Statue and Square, Mohandesin, Cairo.jpg|thumbnail|Ibn Khaldoun Statue and Square, [[Mohandessin]], Cairo]]
Ibn Khaldun said of Egypt, "He who has not seen it does not know the power of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-Khaldun#ref3458&lt;/ref&gt; While other Islamic regions had to cope with border wars and inner strife, the [[Mamluk]]s let Egypt experience a period of economic prosperity and high culture. However, even in Egypt, where Ibn Khaldūn lived out his days, he could not stay out of politics completely. In 1384, the Egyptian Sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir [[Barquq]], made him professor of the Qamhiyyah Madrasah and the grand [[qadi]] of the [[Maliki]] school of fiqh (one of four schools, the Maliki school was widespread primarily in [[Western Africa]]). His efforts at reform encountered resistance, however, and within a year, he had to resign his judgeship. A contributory factor to his decision to resign may have been the heavy personal blow that struck him in 1384, when a ship carrying his wife and children sank off the coast of Alexandria. Ibn Khaldun now decided to complete the pilgrimage to Mecca, after all.

After his return in May 1388, Ibn Khaldūn concentrated more strongly on a purely-educational function at various Cairo madrasas. At court, he fell out of favor for a time, as during revolts against Barquq, he had, apparently under duress, with other Cairo jurists, issued a [[fatwa]] against Barquq. Later relations with Barquq returned to normal, and he was once again named the Maliki ''qadi''. Altogether, he was called six times to that high office, which, for various reasons, he never held long.

In 1401, under Barquq's successor, his son Faraj, Ibn Khaldūn took part in a military campaign against the [[Mongol]] conqueror, [[Timur]], who besieged [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|Damascus]] in 1400. Ibn Khaldūn cast doubt upon the viability of the venture and really wanted to stay in Egypt. His doubts were vindicated, as the young and inexperienced Faraj, concerned about a revolt in Egypt, left his army to its own devices in [[Syria]] and hurried home. Ibn Khaldūn remained at the besieged city for seven weeks, being lowered over the city wall by ropes to negotiate with Timur, in a historic series of meetings that he reported extensively in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bent|first=Josephine van den|date=2016-05-03|title="None of the Kings on Earth is Their Equal in ʿaṣabiyya:" The Mongols in Ibn Khaldūn's Works|journal=Al-Masāq|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–186|doi=10.1080/09503110.2016.1198535|issn=0950-3110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timur questioned him in detail about conditions in the lands of the Maghreb. At his request, Ibn Khaldūn even wrote a long report about it. As he recognized Timur's intentions, he did not hesitate, on his return to Egypt, to compose an equally-extensive report on the history of the [[Tatars]], together with a character study of Timur, sending them to the Merinid rulers in Fez (Maghreb).

Ibn Khaldūn spent the next five years in Cairo completing his autobiography and his history of the world and acting as teacher and judge. Meanwhile, he was alleged to have joined an underground party, Rijal Hawa Rijal, whose reform-oriented ideals attracted the attention of local political authorities. The elderly Ibn Khaldun was placed under arrest. He died on 17 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki ''qadi'' (Judge).

== Works ==

=== Kitāb al-ʻIbar ===
Ibn Khaldūn main work is the '''''Kitāb al-ʻIbar''''' or "Book of Lessons" (full title: ''Kitāb al-ʻIbar wa-Dīwān al-Mubtadaʼ wa-l-Khabar fī Taʼrīkh al-ʻArab wa-l-Barbar wa-Man ʻĀṣarahum min Dhawī ash-Shaʼn al-Akbār'' "Book of Lessons, Record of Beginnings and Events in the History of the Arabs and the Berbers and Their Powerful Contemporaries"),  originally conceived as a history of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] but later expanded in focus to a [[universal history]].

The ''Kitāb al-ʻIbār''  divides into seven books.  Al-''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction),&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun the Muqaddimah. An Introduction to History.Translated from the Arabic by Franz Rosenthal. In Three Volumes. First Volume. 606 pages. Bollingen Foundation Series xliii. Princeton University Press. 1958. Prof. Dr. Darcy Carvalho. Feausp. Sao Paulo. Brazil. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/THEMUQADDIMAHVOLUME1/THE MUQADDIMAH VOLUME 1&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the first book. Books Two to Five cover [[World History]] of Humanity up to the authors own time. Books Six and Seven give the history of the [[Berber people]]s and the Maghreb.  Despite errors originating in the 14th century Fez work, [[Rawd al-Qirtas|Rawḍ al-Qirṭās]], (probably by [[Ibn Abi Zar]]), from which Khaldun drew upon, al-'Ibar remains an important source for [[Berber history]]. The historiographical work has been further criticised for its synthesis of multiple (sometimes contradictory) sources in the absence of original citations, and here Khaldun departs from the classical style of Arab historians such as [[Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqiq|Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqīq]] (~d.1028) or [[al-Mālikī]].&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Modéran and Benabbès in ''Identités et Cultures dans l'Algérie Antique'', University of Rouen, 2005 ({{ISBN|2-87775-391-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the discipline of [[sociology]], he described the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the inevitable loss of power that occurs when warriors conquer a city. According to the Arab scholar [[Sati' al-Husri]], the ''Muqaddimah'' may be read as a sociological work. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of ''[['aṣabiyyah]]'', which has been translated as "[[social cohesion]]", "group solidarity", or "[[tribalism]]". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Some of Ibn Khaldun's views, particularly those concerning the ''[[Zanj]]'' people of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Negative Images of Blacks in Some Medieval Iranian Writings |last1=Southgate|first1=Minoo|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=17|issue=1|page=15|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4310424}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited as a [[Racism|racist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racism: A Global Reader|editor=Kevin Reilly, Stephen Kaufman, Angela Bodino|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2003|page=123|isbn=9780765610591}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not uncommon for their time. According to the scholar Abdelmajid Hannoum, Ibn Khaldun's description of the distinctions between [[Berbers]] and Arabs were misinterpreted by the translator [[William McGuckin de Slane]], who wrongly inserted a "racial ideology that sets Arabs and Berbers apart and in opposition" into his translation of the ''Muqaddimah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannoum|first=Abdelmajid|date=2003|title=Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldûn Orientalist|journal=History and Theory|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–80|jstor=3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most frequently cited observation drawn from Ibn Khaldūn's work is the notion that when a society becomes a great civilization (and, presumably, the dominant culture in its region), its high point is followed by a period of decay. This means that the next cohesive group that conquers the diminished civilization is, by comparison, a group of [[barbarians]]. Once the barbarians solidify their control over the conquered society, however, they become attracted to its more refined aspects, such as literacy and arts, and either assimilate into or appropriate such cultural practices. Then, eventually, the former barbarians will be conquered by a new set of barbarians, who will repeat the process.  One contemporary reader of Khaldun has read this as an early [[business cycle]] theory, though set in the historical circumstances of the mature Islamic empire.{{who|date=July 2016}}{{doubtful|date=June 2017}}{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Ibn Khaldun outlines an early example of [[political economy]]{{doubtful|date=July 2016}}. He describes the economy as being composed of [[theory of value (economics)|value-adding processes]]; that is, labour and skill is added to techniques and crafts and the product is sold at a higher value {{doubtful|date=June 2017}}.  He also made the distinction between "profit" and "sustenance", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively.  He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the ''Muqaddimah''. Ibn Khaldun diverged from norms that Muslim historians followed and rejected their focus on the credibility of the transmitter and focused instead on the validity of the stories and encouraged critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://evonomics.com/amazing-north-african-scholar-beat-adam-smith-half-millennium/|title=The Amazing Arab Scholar Who Beat Adam Smith by Half a Millennium – Evonomics|date=2017-06-09|work=Evonomics|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also believed that the currency of an Islamic monetary system should have [[wikt:intrinsic|intrinsic]] value and therefore be made of [[gold]] and [[silver]] (such as the [[dirham]]). He emphasized that the weight and purity of these coins should be strictly followed: the weight of one dinar should be one ''mithqal'' (the weight of 72 grains of [[barley]], roughly 4.25 grams) and the weight of 7 dinar should be equal to weight of 10 dirhams (7/10 of a ''mithqal'' or 2.96 grams).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34-35.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt.34–35]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social thought ===
Ibn Khaldun's epistemology attempted to reconcile mysticism with theology by dividing science into two different categories, the religious science that regards the sciences of the Qur'an and the non-religious science. He further classified the non-religious sciences into intellectual sciences such as logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, etc. and auxiliary sciences such as language, literature, poetry, etc. He also suggested that possibly more divisions will appear in the future with different societies. He tried to adapt to all possible societies’ cultural behavior and influence in education, economics and politics. Nonetheless, he didn't think that laws were chosen by just one leader or a small group of individual but mostly by the majority of the individuals of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The epistemology of Ibn Khaldun|last=Ahmad|first=Zaid|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-61275-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Ibn Khaldun, the state was a necessity of human society to restrain injustice within the society, but the state means is force, thus itself an injustice. All societies must have a state governing them in order to establish a society. He attempted to standardize the history of societies by identifying ubiquitous phenomena present in all societies. To him, civilization was a phenomena that will be present as long as humans exist. He characterized the fulfillment of basic needs as the beginning of civilization. At the beginning, people will look for different ways of increasing productivity of basic needs and expansion will occur. Later the society starts becoming more sedentary and focuses more on crafting, arts and the more refined characteristics. By the end of a society, it will weaken, allowing another small group of individuals to come into control. The conquering group is described as an unsatisfied group within the society itself or a group of desert bandits that constantly attack other weaker or weakened societies.

In the Muqaddimah, his most important work, he thoughtfully and scrupulously discusses an introduction of philosophy to history in a general manner, based on observable patterns within a theoretical framework of known historical events of his time. He described the beginnings, development, cultural trends and the fall of all societies, leading to the rise of a new society which would then follow the same trends in a continuous cycle. Ibn Khaldun did not create a perfect model for a society during his life, but he did think there was a need for a new model to manage society to ensure its continuous economic growth. Also, he recommended the best political approaches to develop a society according to his knowledge of history. He heavily emphasized that a good society would be one in which a tradition of education is deeply rooted in its culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Ibn Khaldun (1987) introduced word asabiya (solidarity, group feeling, or group consciousness), to explain tribalism. The concept of asabiya has been translated as "social cohesion," "group solidarity," or "tribalism." This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups (Rashed,2017).

Ibn Khaldun believed that too much bureaucracy, such as taxes and legislations, would lead to the decline of a society, since it would constrain the development of more specialized labor (increase in scholars and development of different services). He believed that bureaucrats cannot understand the world of commerce and do not possess the same motivation as a businessman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his work the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun emphasizes human beings' faculty to think (''fikr'') as what determines human behavior and ubiquitous patterns. This faculty is also what inspires human beings to form into a social structure to co-operate in division of labor and organization.  According to Zaid Ahmand in ''Epistemology and the Human Dimension in Urban Studies'', the ''fikr'' faculty is the supporting pillar for all philosophical aspects of Ibn Khaldun's theory related to human beings’ spiritual, intellectual, physical, social and political tendencies.

Another important concept he emphasizes in his work is the mastery of crafts, habits and skills. These takes place after a society is established and according to Ibn Khaldun the level of achievement of a society can be determined by just analyzing these three concepts. A society in its earliest stages is nomadic and primarily concerned with survival, while a society at a later stage is sedentary, with greater achievement in crafts. A society with a sedentary culture and stable politics would be expected to have greater achievements in crafts and technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also emphasized in his epistemology theory the important aspect that educational tradition plays to ensure the new generations of a civilization continuously improve in the sciences and develop culture. Ibn Khaldun argued that without the strong establishment of an educational tradition, it would be very difficult for the new generations to maintain the achievements of the earlier generations, let alone improve them.

Another way to distinguish the achievement of a society would be the language factor of a society, since for him the most important element of a society would not be land, but the language spoken by them. He was surprised that many non-Arabs were really successful in the Arabic society, had good jobs and were well received by the community. "These people were non-Arab by descent, but they grew up among the Arabs who possessed the habit of Arabic," Ibn Khaldun once recalled, "[b]ecause of this, they were able to master Arabic so well that they cannot be surpassed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/UmarIbnAlKhattab2Volumes|title=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|last=Umar Ibn Al Khattab (2 Volumes)|first=Umar Ibn Al Khattab|date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the reason why non-Arabs were accepted as part of Arab society was due to their mastery of the Arabic language.

Advancements in literary works such as poems and prose where another way to distinguish the achievement of a civilization, but Ibn Khaldun believed that whenever the literary facet of a society reaches its highest levels it ceases to indicate societal achievements anymore, but is an embellishment of life. For logical sciences he established knowledge at its highest level as an increase of scholars and the quality of knowledge. For him the highest level of literary productions would be the manifestation of prose, poems and the artistic enrichment of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IbnKhaldunsHistoryalMuqaddimah/Ibn%20khaldun's%20History%20(al-muqaddimah)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Ibn Khaldun's Historiography"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor works ===
From other sources we know of several other works, primarily composed during the time he spent in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]]. His first book, ''[[Lubābu l-Muhassal]]'', a commentary on the [[Islamic theology]] of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], was written at the age of 19 under the supervision of his teacher al-Ābilī in Tunis. A work on [[Sufism]], ''Shifā'u l-Sā'il'', was composed around 1373 in [[Fes, Morocco]]. Whilst at the court of [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada]], Ibn Khaldūn composed a [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|work on logic]], ''ʻallaqa li-s-Sulṭān''.

=== Egypt ===
Ibn Khaldun's historical method had very few precedents or followers in his time. While Ibn Khaldun is known to have been a successful lecturer on jurisprudence within religious sciences, only very few of his students were aware of, and influenced by, his Muqaddimah.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Robert|title=Ibn Khaldun: History as Science and the Patrimonial Empire|date=2002|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|isbn=978-963-05-7934-6|pages=18–20, 22–24|ref=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such student, [[Al-Maqrizi]], praised the Muqaddimah, although some scholars have found his praise, and that of others, to be generally empty and lacking understanding of Ibn Khaldun's methods.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun also faced primarily criticism from his contemporaries, particularly [[Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalani]]. These criticisms included accusations of inadequate historical knowledge, an inaccurate title, disorganization, and a style resembling that of the prolific Arab literature writer, [[Al-Jahiz]]. Al-Asqalani also noted that Ibn Khaldun was not well-liked in Egypt because he opposed many respected traditions, including the traditional judicial dress, and suggested that this may have contributed to the reception of Ibn Khaldun's historical works.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; The notable exception to this consensus was [[Ibn al-Azraq]], a jurist who lived shortly after Ibn Khaldun and quoted heavily from the first and fourth books of the Kitab al-‘Ibar, in developing a work of mirrors for princes.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Ibn Khaldun's work found some recognition with Ottoman intellectuals in the 17th century. The first references to Ibn Khaldun in Ottoman writings appeared in the middle of the 17th century, with historians such as [[Kâtip Çelebi]] naming him as a great influence, while another Turkish Ottoman historian, [[Mustafa Naima]], attempted to use Ibn Khaldun's cyclical theory of the rise and fall of empires to describe the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; Increasing perceptions of the decline of the Ottoman Empire also caused similar ideas to appear independently of Ibn Khaldun in the 16th century, and may explain some of the influence of his works.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, Ibn Khaldun was first brought to the attention of the [[Western world]] in 1697, when a biography of him appeared in [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]]'s ''Bibliothèque Orientale''. However, some scholars believe that Ibn Khaldun's work may have first been introduced to Europe via Ibn Arabshah's biography of Tamerlane, translated to Latin, which covers a meeting between Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane.&lt;ref name="Alatas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alatas|first1=Syed Farid|title=Ibn Khaldun|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-809045-8|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ibn Arabshah, during this meeting, Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane discussed the Maghrib in depth, as well as Tamerlane's genealogy and place in history.&lt;ref name="Fischel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischel|first1=Walter|title=Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane: Their Historic Meeting in Damascus, A.D. 1401 (A.H. 803)|date=1952|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when [[Silvestre de Sacy]]'s ''Chrestomathie Arabe'' included his biography together with a translation of parts of the ''Muqaddimah'' as the ''Prolegomena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|page=118|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the ''Prolegomena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=118–9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; More details on and partial translations of the ''Prolegomena'' emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858. Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9541-53-3|pages=119–20|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European works on Ibn Khaldun suffered heavily from colonial influences and orientalism, as many sociologists considered North Africa to be unworthy of studying in the19th century.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt; Additionally, many sociologists viewed Ibn Khaldun as the only North African sociologist worth studying. [[Reynold A. Nicholson]] praised Ibn Khaldun as a uniquely brilliant Muslim sociologist, but discounted Khaldun's influence.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; Spanish Philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] viewed the conflicts of North Africa as a problem that stemmed from a lack of African thought, and praised Ibn Khaldun for making sense of the conflict by simplifying it to the relationship between the nomadic and sedentary modes of life.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt;

Ibn Khaldun's contributions to economics were ignored by historians like [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who wrote that "we may safely leap over 500 years to the epoch of St [[Thomas Aquinas]]" as late as 1954.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; While Ibn Khaldun lived after St Thomas Aquinas, Schumpeter makes only passing references to Khaldun, and excludes Khaldun's predecessors.&lt;ref name=Alatas /&gt; However, modern historians have recognized the contributions of Ibn Khaldun and many of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ameer Ali|author2=Herb Thompson|title=The Schumpeterian Gap and Muslim Economic Thought|journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics|date=1999|volume=10|pages=31–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern historians ===
Modern historians have also been complimentary in their analysis of Ibn Khaldun's works, and acknowledgement of his contemporaries or standing compared to European scholars is increasingly common. Influential British historian and international affairs specialist [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] has called Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah "the greatest work of its kind."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 15th ed., vol. 9, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Gellner]], once a professor of philosophy and logic at the [[London School of Economics]], considered Khaldun's definition of government the best in the history of political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gellner, ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

More moderate views on the scope of Ibn Khaldun's contributions have emerged. [[Arthur Laffer]], for whom the [[Laffer curve]] is named, acknowledged that Ibn Khaldun's ideas, as well as others, precede his own work on that curve.&lt;ref name="Laffter at Heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |author=[[Arthur Laffer]] |date=June 1, 2004 |title=The Laffer Curve, Past, Present and Future |publisher=Heritage Foundation |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201225944/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm |archivedate=December 1, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on understanding the nuances of Ibn Khaldun's contributions is present, with scholars commenting on the specifics of Khaldun's work, such as "Ibn Khaldun chose to ignore all those crafts which are neither necessary . . . nor honorable" and that Ibn Khaldun "depicts what really happens. . . . he does not discuss whether the state ought, or ought not, to interfere".&lt;ref name="Baali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baali|first1=Fuad|title=The Science of Human Social Organization: Conflicting Views on Ibn Khaldun's (1332–1406) Ilm Al-Umran|date=2005|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lampeter|isbn=978-0-7734-6279-3|pages=77–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historian and sociologist, Ibn Khaldun was recognized by the British philosopher [[Robert Flint]], who wrote: "as a [[theorist]] of history he had no equal in any age or country until [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] appeared, more than three hundred years later. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Augustine]] were not his peers, and all others were unworthy of being even mentioned along with him". Ibn Khaldun's work on evolution of societies also influenced [[Egon Orowan]], who termed the concept of ''socionomy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/eorowan.pdf |title=Egon Orowan. 1901–1989. A Biographical Memoir |author1=F.R.N. Nabarro |author2=A. S. Argon |date=1996 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ibn Khaldun's record-keeping is usually passed over in favor of recognizing his contributions to the science of history, Abderrahmane Lakhsassi wrote "No historian of the Maghreb since and particularly of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] can do without his historical contribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Lakhsassi |date=1996 |editor1=S. H. Nasr |editor2=O. Leaman |title=History of Islamic Philosophy|location=London |publisher=Routledge |chapter=25 – Ibn Khaldun|pages=350–364 |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H024.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public recognition ===
Public recognition of Ibn Khaldun has increased in recent years. In 2004, the [[Tunisian Community Center]] launched the first Ibn Khaldun Award to recognize a Tunisian/American high achiever whose work reflects Ibn Khaldun's ideas of kinship and solidarity. The Award was named after Ibn Khaldun for him being universally acknowledged as the Father of Sociology and also for the convergence of his ideas with the organization's objectives and programs. In 2006, the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]] launched an annual essay contest&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Ibn-Khaldun Essay Contest|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912062823/http://www.atlasusa.org/V2/main/page.php?page_id=741|website=AtlasUSA|publisher=Atlas Economic Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for students named in Ibn Khaldun's honor. The theme of the contest is "how individuals, think tanks, universities and entrepreneurs can influence government policies to allow the free market to flourish and improve the lives of its citizens based on Islamic teachings and traditions."&lt;ref name=Atlas /&gt; In 2006, Spain commemorated the 600th anniversary of the death of Ibn Khaldun, by orchestrating an exhibit titled "Encounter of Civilizations:  Ibn Khaldun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encounter of Civilizations: Ibn Khaldun Exhibit Opens at Headquarters|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/note6056.doc.htm|website=un.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Ibn Khaldun's birthday was recognized by a Google Doodle, which was publicized in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Doodle: Birthday of Ibn Khaldun|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/birthday-of-ibn-khaldun|website=google.com/doodle|publisher=Google|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "He is considered by some as a father of modern economics, or at least a major forerunner. The Western world recognizes Khaldun as the father of sociology but hesitates in recognizing him as a great economist who laid its very foundations. He was the first to systematically analyze the functioning of an economy, the importance of technology, specialization and foreign trade in economic surplus and the role of government and its stabilization policies to increase output and employment. Moreover, he dealt with the problem of optimum taxation, minimum government services, incentives, institutional framework, law and order, expectations, production, and the theory of value".[http://www.ovidius-stec.ro/html/anale/ENG/cuprins%20rezumate/2009%20vol2.pdf Cosma, Sorinel (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15208">The '''imagination age''' is a theoretical period beyond the [[information age]] where creativity and imagination will become the primary creators of economic value.  This contrasts with the information age where analysis and thinking were the main activities.&lt;ref&gt;
Pautler, Albert J., Jr. 1998 [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED427167&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED427167 "Workforce Education: Issues for the New Century."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The concept holds that technologies like [[virtual reality]], [[user created content]] and [[YouTube]] will change the way humans interact with each other and how they create economic and [[social structure]]s.  A key concept is that the rise of the immersive virtual reality, the [[cyberspace]] or the [[metaverse]] will raise the value of imagination work of designers, artists, video makers and actors over rational thinking as a foundation of culture and economics.

== Origins of the term ==

The terms ''imagination age'' and "age of imagination" were first introduced in an essay by designer and writer Charlie Magee in 1993. His essay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/040320/4a32a59dcdc168eced6517b5e6041cda/OSS1993-01-21.pdf "The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You"]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You" proposes the idea that the best way to assess the evolution of human civilization is through the lens of communication.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most successful groups throughout human history have had one thing in common: when compared to their competition they had the best system of communication. The fittest communicators—whether tribe, citystate, kingdom, corporation, or nation—had (1) a larger percentage of people with (2) access to (3) higher quality information, (4) a greater ability to transform that information into knowledge and action, (5) and more freedom to communicate that new knowledge to the other members of their group.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Imagination Age" has been popularized as a cultural and economic philosophy by artist, writer and cultural philosopher [[Rita J. King]] in her November 2007 essay for the [[British Council]], [http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"] where she began using the phrase, "Toward a New Global Culture and Economy in the Imagination Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm |title=The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age |publisher=British Council |date= |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; King further refined the development of her thinking in a 2008 Paris essay entitled, "Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age"&lt;ref name="vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theimaginationage.net/2008/02/our-vision-for-sustainable-culture-in.html |title=Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age |publisher=The Imagination AGe |date= |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she states, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Active participants in the Imagination Age are becoming cultural ambassadors by introducing virtual strangers to unfamiliar customs, costumes, traditions, rituals and beliefs, which humanizes foreign cultures, contributes to a sense of belonging to one's own culture and fosters an interdependent perspective on sharing the riches of all systems. Cultural transformation is a constant process, and the challenges of modernization can threaten identity, which leads to unrest and eventually, if left unchecked, to violent conflict. Under such conditions it is tempting to impose homogeneity, which undermines the highly specific systems that encompass the myriad luminosity of the human experience.&lt;ref name="vision" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Rita J. King has expanded her interpretation of the Imagination Age concept through speeches at the [[O'Reilly Media]], [[TED (conference)|TED]], [[Cusp Conference|Cusp]], and [[Business Innovation Factory]] conferences.&lt;ref name="congratulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theimaginationage.net/2009/09/congratulations-to-rita-j-king-gov-20.html

The term ''imagination age'' was subsequently popularized in techno-cultural discourse by other writers, [[futurists]] and technologists, who attributed the term to Rita J. King, including [[Jason Silva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-silva/loveland-and-the-imaginat_b_786616.html |title=LOVELAND and the Imagination Age |publisher=The Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2010-11-22 |first=Jason |last=Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tish Shute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugotrade.com/2007/11/19/global-communities-in-the-imagination-age/ |title=Global Communities in The Imagination Age |publisher=UgoTrade |date= |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology entrepreneur and publisher of Augmented Reality and emerging technology blog "[http://www.UgoTrade.com UgoTrade]".

Earlier, one-time, references to the imagination age can be found attributed to Carl W. Olson in his 2001 book [http://www.paperbackswap.com/Boss-Dead-Leadership-Carl-W-Olson/book/0759615764/ "The Boss is Dead...: Leadership Breakthroughs for the Imagination Age] {{ISBN|0-7596-1576-4}}&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Carl W.

==Economic rise of imagination==

The imagination age would be a society and culture dominated by an [[imagination economy]].  The idea relies on a key [[Marxist]] concept that culture is a superstructure fully conditioned by the economic substructure.  According to Marxist thinking certain kinds of culture and art were made possible by the adoption of farming technology.  Then with the rise of industry new forms of political organization (democracy, militarism, fascism, communism) were made possible along with new forms of culture (mass media, news papers, films).  These resulted in people changing.  In the case of industrialization people were trained to become more literate, to follow time routines, to live in urban communities.

The concept of the imagination age extends this to a new order emerging presently.

An imagination economy is defined by some thinkers as an economy where intuitive and creative thinking create economic value, after logical and rational thinking has been outsourced to other economies.&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, Geoffrey [http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/05/magazines/fortune/imaginationeconomy.fortune/index.htm "The imagination economy"], FORTUNE Magazine, July 5, 2006, Reproduced in CNN Money online&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Cox (academic)|Michael Cox]] Chief Economist at [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] argues that economic trends show a shift away from information sector employment and job growth towards creative jobs.  Jobs in publishing, he has pointed out are declining while jobs for designers, architects, actors &amp; directors, software engineers and photographers are all growing.  This shift in job creation is a sign the beginning of the Imagination Age.&lt;ref&gt;needs reference&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st century has seen a growth in games and interactive media jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Brockman, NPR 2010  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122290666&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp "When Play Means Pay: Video Game Jobs On The Rise"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox argues that the skills can be viewed as a  "hierarchy of human talents",&lt;ref&gt;Phil Searle [http://www.ssonetwork.com/business-process-outsourcing/articles/q-a-michael-cox-chief-economist-federal-reserve-ba "Q&amp;A: Michael Cox, Chief Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"]&lt;/ref&gt; with raw physical effort as the lowest form of value creation, above this skilled labor and information entry to creative reasoning and emotional intelligence.  Each layer provides more value creation than the skills below it, and the outcome of [[globalization]] and [[automation]] is that labor is made available for higher level skills that create more value.  Presently these skills tend to be around imagination, social and emotional intelligence.

==The ages of human history==
The ideas of the Imagination Age depends in large part upon an idea of progress through history because of technology, outlined by [[Marx]].

The idea is that human culture has moved through a number of major stages of development.  According to this idea civilization has progressed through the following ages or [[Epoch (reference date)|Epochs]]:
*[[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Age]] – Age dominated by work with wooden tool and animals to produce food.
*[[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]] – Economy dominated by factories producing commodities.
*[[Information Age]] – Economy dominated by [[knowledge workers]] using computer and other electronic devices in sectors like research, finance, consulting, information technology and other services.

Following this is a new [[paradigm]] created by virtual technology, high speed internet, and other technologies.  This new paradigm, the argument goes, will create a new kind of global culture and economy called the Imagination Age.

==Technology and the imagination age==
Key to the idea that imagination is becoming the key commodity of our time is a confidence that Virtual Reality technology, like [[Oculus Rift]] and [[HoloLens]] will emerge to take much of the place of the current text and graphic dominated Internet. This will provide a 3-D Internet where imagination and creativity over information and search will be key talents to creating user experience and value.

The concept is not limited to just virtual reality. Charlie Magee states that the technology that will develop during the imagination age would include:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best bet is on a hybrid breakthrough created by the meshing of [[nanotechnology]], computer science (including [[artificial intelligence]]), [[biotechnology]] (including [[biochemistry]], [[biopsychology]], etc.), and virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Magee [http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/040320/4a32a59dcdc168eced6517b5e6041cda/OSS1993-01-21.pdf "The Age of Imagination Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' [[Raymond Kurzweil]] states that future combination of AI, nano-technology, and biotechnology will create a world where anything that can be imagined will be possible, raising the importance of imagination as the key mode of human thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray "[[The Singularity is Near]]" Viking Penguin 2005 p299-300 {{ISBN|0-7156-3561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture, economy and the imagination age==
Imagination Age as a philosophical tenet heralding a new wave of cultural and economic innovation appears to have been first introduced by Rita J. King in a 2008 collection of essays for the [[British Council]] entitled, "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"&lt;ref name="britishcouncil"&gt;[http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"]&lt;/ref&gt; Says King, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than exist as an unwitting victim of circumstance, all too often unaware of the impact of having been born in a certain place at a certain time, to parents firmly nestled within particular values and socioeconomic brackets, millions of people are creating new virtual identities and meaningful relationships with others who would have remained strangers, each isolated within their respective realities.&lt;ref name="britishcouncil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global implications==
Rita J. King has been the single major advocate of the Imagination Age concept and its implications on cultural relations, identity and the transformation of the global economy and culture. Rita J. King has expounded on the concept through speeches at the [[O'Reilly Media]] and [[TED (conference)|TED]] conferences&lt;ref name="congratulations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="understandingislam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt; and has argued that virtual world technology and changes in people's ability to imagine other lives could promote world understanding and reduce [[cultural conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.treet.tv/metanomics-imagination-age Playing Metanomics :: The Imagination Age]&lt;/ref&gt; Some public policy experts have argued the emergence of the Imagination Age out of the Information Age will have a major impact on overall public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tod Newcombe [http://www.govtech.com/pcio/128301 "A Champion for the Imagination Age"] Public CIO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential timeframe==

Some argue it has already started. They state that imagination is the most valued skill in our modern society.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sultan Abdullah Bahabri 2003 [http://archive.biomedcentral.com/1476-3591/1/2 "The Buzz and the Sting"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb| ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60, by [[William Bell Scott]] illustrates the rise of coal and iron working in the Industrial Revolution and the heavy engineering projects they made possible.]]
The '''Industrial Age''' is a period of history that encompasses the changes in economic and social organization that began around 1760 in Great Britain and later in other countries, characterized chiefly by the replacement of hand tools with power-driven machines such as the power loom and the steam engine, and by the concentration of industry in large establishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/210a/readings/temin1.pdf Two Views Of The British Industrial Revolution], Peter Temin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/industrial+revolution|title=Industrial-revolution - Define Industrial-revolution at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is commonly believed that the Industrial Age was supplanted by the [[Information Age]] in the late 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/5-Myths-About-the-Information/127105/|title=5 Myths About the 'Information Age'|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that has become common since the [[Revolutions of 1989]], as of 2013 electric power generation is still based mostly on [[fossil fuels]] and much of the [[Third World]] economy is still based on [[manufacturing]]. Thus it is debatable whether we have left the Industrial Age already or are still in it and in the process of reaching the Information Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senscot.net/view_prof.php?viewid=4353|title=Human beings have never before lived in a condition where our actions today literally affect people|work=senscot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Huge changes in agricultural methods made the Industrial Revolution possible. This agricultural revolution started with changes in farming in the Netherlands, later developed by the British.

The Industrial [[mining]] from places such as [[Wales]] and [[County Durham]].

The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain because it had the factors of production, land (all natural resources), capital, and labor. Britain had plenty of harbors that enabled trade, Britain had access to capital, such as goods and money, for example, tools, machinery, equipment, and inventory. Britain, lastly, had an abundance of labor, or industrial workers in this case. There are many other conditions that help show why the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. The British Isles and colonies overseas represented huge markets that created a large demand for British goods. Britain also had one of the largest [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] due to its massive [[Royal Navy|navy]] and [[Merchant navy|merchant marine]]. The British government's concern for commercial interests was also important. 
The [[steam engine]] allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the [[Industrial Revolution]] had spread to [[Continental Europe]] and [[North America]], and since then it has spread to most of the world.

==The Textile Industry==

The cotton industry was the first industry to go through [[mechanization]], the use of automatic machinery to increase production. The [[Putting-out system|domestic system]] sprouted as a result of when businesses began importing raw cotton, employing spinners and weavers to make it into cloth from their home. Jarry Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which could produce eight times as much thread as a single spinning wheel, and [[Richard Arkwright]] made it driven by water. Later Arkwright opened a spinning mill which marked the beginning of the [[factory system]]. In 1785 [[Edmund Cartwright]] invented a loom which was powered by water.

==Steam Engines==

In 1712 [[Thomas Newcomen]] produced the first successful [[steam engine]], and in 1769 [[James Watt]] patented the modern steam engine. As a result, steam replaced water as industry's major power source.

The [[steam engine]] allowed for steamboats and the locomotives, which made transportation much faster. By the mid-19th century the [[Industrial Revolution]] had spread to [[Continental Europe]] and [[North America]], and since then it has spread to most of the world.

The Industrial Age is defined by [[mass production]], [[broadcasting]], the rise of the [[nation state]], [[Energy industry|power]], [[modern medicine]] and [[running water]]. The quality of human life has increased dramatically during the Industrial Age. Life expectancy today worldwide is more than twice as high as it was when the Industrial Revolution began.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5708">The '''International Association for Media and History''' (IAMHIST) is a scholarly organization which brings together [[media historian]]s and professionals with an interest in [[media history]].  Founded in the summer of 1977 it organizes biennial conferences, which have typically rotated between venues in the UK, US and the continent of Europe.  The association has been especially associated with the study of the role of film, radio and television in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s and the [[Cold War]], and the advancement of the systematic use of audiovisual materials as historical sources.  The organization produces the quarterly journal ''[[The Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television]].''

IAMHIST is an organisation of scholars dedicated to the research of the history of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Priestley by [[Ellen Sharples]] (1794)&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, ''Iconography'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Joseph Priestley]] ({{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} &amp;ndash; 8 February 1804) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[natural philosopher]], [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] [[clergyman]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], and [[theologian]]. While his achievements in all of these areas are renowned, he was also dedicated to improving education in Britain; he did this on an individual level and through his support of the [[Dissenting academies]]. His [[grammar]] textbook was innovative and highly influential. More importantly, though, Priestley introduced a [[liberal arts]] curriculum at [[Warrington Academy]], arguing that a practical education would be more useful to students than a classical one. He was also the first to advocate the study and teaching of [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], an interest driven by his belief that humanity was improving and could bring about [[Millennialism|Christ's Millennium]].

==Personal and institutional teaching==
Priestley was a teacher in one way or another throughout his entire adult life. Once he discovered how much he enjoyed teaching, he consistently returned to this calling. At the school he established in [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]], he taught a wide range of topics to the town's children: [[Latin]] (and perhaps Greek), [[History of geography#Marco Polo to the 18th century|geography]], [[mathematics]], and [[English grammar]]. Unusually for the time, he also taught [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this school, he was offered the position of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy]]. In later years, when he lived in [[Leeds]] and [[Birmingham]], he created classes for the youth of his parishes; in Birmingham his three classes totaled 150 students and he helped organize the New Meeting [[Sunday school]]s for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 242-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received an excellent education at Daventry, a [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], and convinced that education was the key to shaping people and the world's future, Priestley continued to support the Dissenting academies throughout his life. For example, he advised the founders of [[New College at Hackney]] on its curriculum and preached a charity sermon on the "proper Objects of Education" to help raise money for the school. After emigrating to America in 1794, Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him. He attempted to find funding for the Northumberland Academy and donated his library to it, but the academy did not open until 1813 and closed soon after. He communicated with [[Thomas Jefferson]] regarding the proper organization of a university and when Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]], it was Priestley's curricular principles that dominated the school. Jefferson also passed Priestley's advice on to [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], whose [[College of William &amp; Mary]] also followed Priestley's maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever Priestley went, he also instructed people in [[natural philosophy]]. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, such as a [[microscope]], for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In [[Calne]], where he was a tutor to the son of [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778), published during these years, that children should not only be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 14; Schofield, Vol. 2, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Priestley moved to Birmingham in 1780, he encouraged the town's children to play with his apparatus and ask questions about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and "perambulator" (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed [[magic lantern]] shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 245-6; Gibbs, 140; Uglow, 319-20; 407; Jackson, 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
In 1765, Priestley dedicated his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; to the governing board of Warrington Academy. In it he argues that young people's education should anticipate their practical needs, something he accused the current universities, Dissenting and Establishment alike, of failing to do. In Priestley's eyes, the contemporary focus on a traditional [[classics|classical education]] prevented students from acquiring useful skills. This principle of utility guided his unusual curricular recommendations. He proposed that students study English and the modern languages instead of the classical languages, learn practical mathematics, read modern rather than ancient history, and study the constitution and laws of England. He believed that these topics would prepare his students for the commercial middle-class life that most of them would live; he did not believe that the poor should receive this same education, arguing "it could be of no service to their country, and often a real detriment to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 Warrington Academy replaced its old classical curriculum with Priestley's new [[liberal arts]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52-4; Schofield, Vol. 1, 124-5; Watts, 95-7; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have argued that this work and his later ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]'' (1778) (often reprinted with the ''Essay on Education'')&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education]]. More especially, as it respects the conduct of the mind''. Bath: Printed by R. Cruttwell; London: J. Johnson, 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; made Priestley the "most considerable English writer on educational philosophy" between [[John Locke]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
[[File:PriestleyGrammar.png|left|upright|thumb|Title page from the first edition of Priestley's ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar|Rudiments]]'' (1761)]]
Priestley's first successful educational venture was the establishment of a local school in [[Nantwich]]. Believing that all students should have a good grasp of the [[English language]] and its [[Grammar#History|grammar]] before learning any other language and dismayed at the quality of the instruction manuals available, Priestley wrote his own textbook: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was very successful—it was reprinted for over fifty years. Its humor may have contributed to its popularity; for example, Priestley illustrated the ''[[couplet]]'' with this rhyme:

::Beneath this stone my wife doth lie:
::She's now at rest, and so am I.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also quoted from the most famous English authors, encouraging the middle-class association between reading and pleasure, a reading that would also, Priestley hoped, foster morality. Priestley's innovations in the teaching and description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to disassociate it from Latin grammar, made his textbook revolutionary and have led twentieth-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 1, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rudiments'' influenced all of the major grammarians of the late eighteenth century: [[Robert Lowth]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], [[John Horne Tooke]] and even the American [[Noah Webster]]. The resounding success of Priestley's book was one of the reasons that [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 83-5; 99-100; Jackson, 52; Gibbs, 16; Watts, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Priestley's philosophy was founded on the fervent belief that a thorough understanding of history was necessary not only to worldly success but also to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135; 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "my view was, not merely to make history intelligible to persons who may choose to read it for amusement, but .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to facilitate its subserviency to the highest uses to which it can be applied: to contribute to its forming the able statesman and the intelligent and useful citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; His abiding interest in history, particularly [[Historiography#Modern historiography|modern history]], sets Priestley apart from his contemporaries. Priestley was the first person to advocate the serious study of modern history; no other British university was teaching the subject at the time and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] would not begin until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Warrington Academy, Priestley gave a series of lectures on history and government; in 1788 he finally published them as ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''. Need first edition publication information.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, he narrates a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous one and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Highly as we think of the ''wisdom of our ancestors'' we justly think of ourselves, of the present age, wiser and . . . must see that we can . . . improve upon institutions that have been transmitted to us. Let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political, and all kinds of knowledge, and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them. [Priestley's emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]] decline narrative found in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume|David Hume's]] cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Gibbon and Hume, Priestley did not limit himself to narrating a version of history in these ''Lectures''; he also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He also contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilizations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 2, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory underpinning Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history and his educational philosophy, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association. Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke|John Locke's]] theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) and laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749), postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world traveled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charts of biography and history===
[[File:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
As a supplement to his lectures on history, Priestley also designed and published ''[[A Chart of Biography]]'' (1765)&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''New Chart of History'' (1769) (which he dedicated to [[Benjamin Franklin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A New Chart of History]]''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts and their accompanying ''Descriptions'' would allow students, Priestley said, to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning his all of his people to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the eighteenth century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principle Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious education==
[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|left|thumb|upright|Title page from the second edition of ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'']]
Priestley pondered what form the best religious education would take throughout his life. In the 1760s, when he was a student at [[Daventry Academy]], he imbibed the pedagogical principles of its founder, [[Philip Doddridge]]; although he was dead, Doddridge's emphasis on academic rigor and freedom of thought lived on at the school and impressed Priestley. These ideals would always be a part of Priestley's educational programs. He began writing one of these while still at Daventry, the ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not publish the work until 1772, when he was at [[Leeds]]. In an effort to increase and stabilize membership at his church there, he taught three religious education classes. He subdivided the young people of the congregation into three categories: young men from 18-30 to whom he taught "the elements of natural and revealed religion" (young women may or may not be included in this group); children under 14 to whom he taught "the first elements of religious knowledge by way of a short catechism in the plainest and most familiar language possible"; and "an intermediate class" to whom he taught "knowledge of the Scriptures only."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170; Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later [[Sunday school]]s established by [[Robert Raikes]], Priestley aimed his classes at middle-class Rational Dissenters; he wanted to teach them "the principles of natural religion and the evidences and doctrine of revelation in a regular and systematic course," something their parents could not provide.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley wrote texts for the courses he envisioned: ''A Catechism for Children and Young Persons'' (1767), which went through eleven English-language editions;&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A catechism for children, and young persons''. Need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scripture Catechism, consisting of a Series of Questions, with References to the Scriptures instead of Answers'' (1772), which went through six British editions by 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A scripture catechism, consisting of a series of questions, with references to the scriptures instead of answers''. need publication information for first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to write non-sectarian ''Catechisms'', but in this he failed. He offended many orthodox readers by focusing on God's benevolence instead of on Adam's sin and Christ's atonement. Priestley implemented this same system of religious instruction over a decade later in [[Birmingham]], when he became a minister at New Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Vol. 1, 170-1; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of pre-Columbian cultures''' includes those [[civilization]]s and [[culture]]s of [[the Americas]] which flourished prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]].

==Cultural characteristics==
[[File:Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watson Brake]], [[Louisiana]], 3500 BC]]
[[File:Tikal-Plaza-And-North-Acropolis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tikal]], [[Guatemala]], [[Maya civilization]].]]
Many [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations established permanent or urban settlements, [[agriculture]], and [[complex society|complex societal hierarchies]].
In North America, indigenous cultures in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]] during the Middle Archaic period built complexes of multiple mounds, with several in Louisiana dated to 5600–5000 BP (3700 BC–3100 BC). [[Watson Brake]] is considered the oldest, multiple mound complex in the Americas, as it has been dated to 3500 BC.  It and other Middle Archaic sites were built by pre-ceramic, hunter-gatherer societies. They preceded the better known [[Poverty Point culture]] and its [[Poverty Point|elaborate complex]] by nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="Preucel"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccsmpug-xaoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Hedgepeth+Middle+Archaic+site&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wHOzYtK-q&amp;sig=3eKTCzKwSwl-S07zX8S-yEz7yv0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QI2yTou4BsKA2wXlmZHhAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hedgepeth%20Middle%20Archaic%20site&amp;f=false Robert W. Preucel, Stephen A. Mrozowski, ''Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: The New Pragmatism''], John Wiley and Sons, 2010, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi Valley mound-building tradition extended into the Late Archaic period, longer than later southeastern mound building dependent on sedentary, agricultural societies.(Russo, 1996:285)&lt;ref name="Preucel"/&gt;

Some of these civilizations had long ceased to function by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th – early 16th centuries), and are known only through [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigations or [[oral history]] from nations today. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]], and [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] had their own written records.  However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical and [[Book burning|burned]] most of them. Only a few documents were hidden and thus remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

From both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive attributes, having populous cities, and having developed theories of astronomy and mathematics.

Where they persist, the societies and cultures which gave rise to these civilizations continue to adapt and evolve; they also uphold various traditions and practices which relate back to these earlier times, even if combined with those more recently adopted.

[[Human sacrifice]] was a religious practice principally characteristic of pre-Columbian Aztec civilization, although other Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya and the Zapotec practiced it as well. The extent of the practice is debated by modern scholars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Microhistory''' is the intensive [[History|historical]] investigation of a well-defined smaller unit of research (most often a single event, the community of a village, or an individual). In its ambition, however, microhistory can be distinguished from a simple [[case study]] insofar as microhistory aspires to "[ask] large questions in small places", to use the definition given by Charles Joyner.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, C. W. ''Shared Traditions: Southern History and Folk Culture'', (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XH0gSiHYhrQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Joyner,+search+for+answers+to+large+questions+in+small+places&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0urxT7_2DKas2wWZ3bHDCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=answers%20to%20large%20questions&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Microhistory originally developed in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giovanni Levi]], one of the pioneers of the approach, it began as a reaction to a perceived crisis in existing historiographical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|pages=93&amp;ndash;94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carlo Ginzburg]], another of microhistory's founders, has written that he first heard the term used around 1977, and soon afterwards began to work with Levi and [[Simona Cerutti]] on ''Microstorie'', a series of microhistorical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "microhistory" dates back to 1959, when the American historian [[George R. Stewart]] published ''Pickett's Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack on Gettysburg, July 3, 1863'', which tells the story of the final day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early use was by the [[Annales School|Annales]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]], for whom the concept had negative connotations, being overly concerned with the history of events.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third early use of the term was in the title of Luis González's 1968 work ''Pueblo en vilo: Microhistoria de San José de Gracia''.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;  González distinguished between microhistory, for him synonymous with local history, and "''petite histoire''", which is primarily concerned with anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg93-12/&gt;

==Approach==
The most distinctive aspect of the microhistorical approach is the small scale of investigations.&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt;  Microhistorians focus on small units in society, as a reaction to the generalisations made by the social sciences which do not necessarily hold up when tested against these smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnússon|first=Sigurdur Gylfi|title='The Singularization of History': Social History and Microhistory within the Postmodern State of Knowledge|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=36|issue=3|year=2003|page=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, Ginzburg's 1976 work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'' &amp;ndash; "probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory"&lt;ref name=Tristano96-26/&gt; &amp;ndash; investigates the life of a single sixteenth-century Italian miller, Menocchio.  The individuals microhistorical works are concerned with are frequently those Robert Tristano describes as "little people", especially those considered heretics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|pages=26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Ginzburg has written that a core principle of microhistory is making obstacles in sources, such as [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], part of the historical account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|year=1993|title=Microhistory, Two or Three Things That I Know about It|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|issue=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, Levi has said that the point of view of the researcher becomes part of the account in microhistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Giovanni|chapter=On Microhistory|year=1991|editor-last=Burke|editor-first=Peter|title=New Perspectives on Historical Writing|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable aspects of microhistory as a historical approach are an interest in the interaction of elite and popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interest in the interaction between micro- and macro-levels of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tristano|first=Richard M.|year=1996|title=Microhistory and Holy Family Parish: Some Historical Considerations|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|volume=14|issue=3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NAMM Oral History Program''' was created and is funded by [[NAMM]], the International Association of Music Products. The program was approved by the NAMM board of directors in the years before the association, which is known for its yearly trade shows, was ready to celebrate the 100 anniversary of the organization. The first NAMM Oral History was conducted in April 2000 with former [[Gibson Guitar]] president [[Ted McCarty]]. McCarty signed [[Les Paul]] on to Gibson in the 1950s to lend his name to the now famous [[Gibson Les Paul]] Guitar. Paul was interviewed as part of the NAMM Oral History program back in 2008.

== History ==

Over the years the collection sought to capture, archive and share the stories of those who have inspired people to make music!  As a result, instrument creators such as [[Hartley Peavey]] and [[Remo]] Belli have been included as well as music retailers, music publishers and those who can fill in the history of the companies, products and people who shaped the industry such as musicians, composers, method book authors, factory workers and salesman of musical products.

Music industry pioneers that have been interviewed for the NAMM Oral History program include [[Bob Moog]], [[Don Buchla]], Henry Z. [[Steinway]], [[Bob Taylor (luthier)]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].

The collection also includes music retailers and the history of such store chains as [[Sam Ash]] and [[Guitar Center]] as well as independent music stores around the world such as West Music and Newton Piano.

Among the musicians linked to the music industry and thus interviewed for this collection are those who designed an instrument, endorsed a product or wrote a method book that has inspired others to make music.  These include [[B. B. King]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Joe Morello]] and [[Herbie Hancock]].

The first interview to be donated to the collection was conducted in 1996 with jazzman [[Jonah Jones]].  Jones spoke of his relationship with [[King Musical Instruments]] as a product tester and endorser.  He later played an [[F. E. Olds]] trumpet, which was featured on many recordings during his long career.

In the Spring of 2011 NAMM announced the completion of its 1,500th interview.  Later that year Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lee of [[Tom Lee Music]] in Hong Kong were interviewed together, which was an important addition to the collection.  During the NAMM Summer Show in Nashville in July 2011, music store owner George Gruhn was awarded the first NAMM Oral History Service Award for support that included arranging interviews and providing historic background.  The second NAMM Oral History Service Award was presented to Hal Leonard Publishing CEO Keith Mardak for his decade long support to the program.  With Mardak's help, interviews were completed with music publishers, songwriters, composers and music method book authors.

The '''Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project''' ('''OLOHP''') is a [[Oral History|collection of interviews]] created by [[Arden Eversmeyer]] for the [[Sophia Smith Collection]] to document and appreciate the lives of members of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change (OLOC). The project contains over 150 interviews and transcripts, many of which include secondary documents pertaining to their subjects such as photographs, artwork, and newspaper clippings.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviewees come from a variety of backgrounds and places but are all lesbians over the age of 70.

== History ==

The Old Lesbians Organizing for Change were founded in 1987 in response to the blatant combination of ageism and sexism in regards to older lesbians. The initial meeting was inspired by the publication of Look Me in the Eye: Old Women, Aging and Ageism by  Barbara Macdonald and Cynthia Rich in 1983, 4 years prior.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss547_bioghist.html
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change Records
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the organization is to "confront ageism in our communities and our country" through education and public discourse. They were a major presence at a variety of national lesbian events such as the National Lesbian Conference in Atlanta in 1991 hosted by the [[Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance]] and the [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation|March on Washington]]. Supporters may be of any age and younger individuals warmly welcomed, however the minimum age of membership is 60 years old.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.oloc.org/about/index.php
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change About Page
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 OLOC reached an even higher level of legitimacy as they reached non-profit status in the state of Texas to continue their work.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.oloc.org/herstory2.php
 | title=Old Lesbians Organizing for Change Herstory
 | accessdate=27 March 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLOC continues to be an active force in pursuing the equality for all.

The ""Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project" is the culmination of the individual stories of some of the founding members of OLOC. Originally created by [[Arden Eversmeyer]] the project seeks to expose the life stories of women from past generations, including images and other supplementary documents. Eversmeyer was inspired to gather these oral histories when she observed friends passing away in her area and was concerned that their stories would never be shared. While subjects such as [[feminism]] and [[civil rights]] are touched upon in many of the interviews, there is no common focus other than the shared experience of old lesbians. Much of the material is purely autobiographical in nature.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Albino raindeer.jpg|Rangifer tarandus
Image:CapraIbex-1.jpg|Capra ibex
Image:Wooly rhinoceros.jpg|Woolly rhinoceros
Image:Mammouth.png|Mammoth
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

{{creationism2}}

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him. Your life or mine is but a half-sentence in the book of the world. Tear it from its place, and it cannot be read; or if it can be read, it signifies nothing".&lt;ref name="Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite"&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/files/christchair/Hebblethwaite%20In%20Defence%20of%20Christianity.pdf Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], In Defence of Christianity March 6, 2005, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Brian Hebblethwaite]]|source=}}

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the Universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], an author whose works have been banned by several [[Haredi]] rabbis for going against the tenets of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Safran, [http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm "Gedolei Yisroel Condemn Rabbi Nosson Slifkin's Books"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229212121/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm |date=2007-12-29 }}. Dei'ah veDibur, January 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

{{quotation|God essentially created two conflicting accounts of Creation: one in nature, and one in the [[Torah]]. How can it be determined which is the real story, and which is the fake designed to mislead us? One could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story, and that the Torah was devised by God to test us with a fake history!

One has to be able to rely on God's truthfulness if religion is to function. Or, to put it another way—if God went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old, who are we to disagree?&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin, p167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Similar formulations==

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme [[philosophical skepticism]] with regard to memory.&lt;ref name=russell5&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Russell | first1 = Bertrand | authorlink1 = Bertrand Russell | title = Analysis of Mind | year = 1921 | publisher = G.

===Borges's ''Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius''===
[[Jorge Luis Borges]], in his 1940 work, ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', describes a fictional world in which some essentially follow as a religious belief a philosophy much like Russell's discussion on the [[logical extreme]] of Gosse's theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://interglacial.com/~sburke/pub/Borges_-_Tlon,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius.html#backto2 Borges - Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|One of the schools of Tlön goes so far as to negate time: it reasons that the present is indefinite, that the future has no reality other than as a present hope, the past none other than present memory.}}

Borges had earlier written a short essay, "The Creation and P. H. Gosse"&lt;ref name="borges-essay"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that explored the rejection of Gosse's ''Omphalos''. Borges argued that its unpopularity stemmed from Gosse's explicit (if inadvertent) outlining of what Borges characterized as absurdities in the Genesis story.

Born in [[Corsicana, Texas]] on October 17, 1952 from Theodore Phillip "Ted" Gowan and Julia Thedia "Judy" Morris Gowan, he graduated from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and business at [[Howard Payne University]]. He was really interested in genealogy and travelling since a child which he later demonstrated throughout his research on the Titanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obituaries.corsicanadailysun.com/obituary/phil-gowan-1058661956 Phil's Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The parents-in-law of his mother perished on the disaster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/reflections-on-the-titanic-historian-phil-gowan Reflections on the Titanic: Historian Phil Gowan]&lt;/ref&gt;.

His research field focused more on passengers and crew, and the [[Sinking of RMS Titanic|sinking]] itself, getting exclusive photographs and stories that he made public and interviewing several survivors, like [[Milvina Dean]] and the families of those who died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.dfw.cbslocal.com/arlington/events/phil-gowan-history-titanic-/E0-001-045405052-8 Phil Gowan - The History of the Titanic]&lt;/ref&gt;
He's also known for his accurate calculation of the number of passengers on board, calculation that bears the name ''Gowan Numbers'': 1,496 people died and 712 survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://titanicnewschannel.com/blog/tag/phil-gowan/ RECENT TITANIC NEWS: TITANIC SURVIVOR ACCUSED OF COWARDICE CLEARED;DEATH OF TITANIC EXPERT]&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in several international congresses about the Titanic as a guest by [[Titanic Historical Society]], was interviewed by [[National Geographic]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Titanic-survivor-status-in-question-3618124.php Titanic survivor status in question]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/history/15-facts-about-the-titanic.aspx 15 FACTS ABOUT THE TITANIC]&lt;/ref&gt; and television networks of several countries of the world; and published articles in newspapers.
Although having serious illnesses during his life, he lost the battle against cancer on May 1, 2018 at the age of 65, being recognized by many as a renowned Titanic historian.

'''''Restoration''''' was a set of [[BBC television]] series where viewers decided on which [[listed building]] that was in immediate need of remedial works was to win a grant from [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It first aired in 2003.

The host of all three series is [[Griff Rhys Jones]], whilst investigating each building in the heats are the show's resident "ruin detectives", [[Marianne Suhr]] and [[Ptolemy Dean]].

==First series==
[[List of Restoration candidates#First Series (2003)|Thirty buildings]] featured in ten regional heats in 2003, with money raised from the telephone vote being added to the prize fund. Viewers chose which of a selection of the United Kingdom's most important, but neglected, buildings should be awarded a [[Heritage Lottery Fund|Heritage Lottery Grant]] of [[GBP|£]]3m.&lt;ref&gt;
Welsh, J (2003) "£3m pledge to BBC's 'Restoration'", http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a11580/gbp3m-pledge-to-bbcs-restoration.html#
&lt;/ref&gt; The winning building was the [[turkish bath|turkish-bath]] section of the [[Victoria Baths, Manchester|Victoria Baths]] in [[Manchester]]; however, bureaucratic and technical hurdles meant that the money raised could not be spent immediately, and final planning-approval to begin a restoration process did not go through until September 2005. The first phase of restoration work finally began on 19 March 2007.

[[Kate Humble]] co-hosted the 2003 live grand final.

==Second series==
A second series, featuring [[List of Restoration candidates#Second Series (2004)|21 buildings]] in 7 regional heats, appeared on [[BBC Two]] in the summer of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, J (2004) "Air date set for second 'Restoration' ", http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a14873/air-date-set-for-second-restoration.html&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was the Old Grammar School and [[Saracen's Head]] in [[Kings Norton]], [[Birmingham]]. Both buildings closed to the public in July 2006 for archeological investigation, restoration work began in February 2007.  Both buildings were officially reopened on 13 June 2008.

The 2004 live Grand Final was co-hosted by [[Natasha Kaplinsky]].

On 4 September 2005, Rhys Jones presented a programme, updating viewers as to the progress made by the featured buildings, or otherwise.

==Third series==
A third series of nine programmes, presented by [[Griff Rhys Jones]], began on BBC Two in August 2006. Entitled '''''Restoration Village''''', the series focused on buildings in smaller settlements, using the same format and voting as before, featuring [[List of Restoration candidates#Third Series "Restoration Village" (2006)|21 buildings]] in 7 regional heats. Updates about previously featured buildings were also included. The winner of Restoration Village was Chedham's Yard, an early 19th-century blacksmith's yard.

===Updates===
On 22 April 2009, Rhys Jones presented "Restoration Revisited", a 60-minute programme updating viewers as to the progress made by some of the 72 featured buildings throughout the three TV series.

==The Perfect Village==

'''''The Perfect Village''''' was a companion series of architectural travelogues presented by [[Ptolemy Dean]], and shown on [[BBC Four]] in 2006. The show chose twelve villages from all around the United Kingdom as illustrations of village life. In the final show [[Heighington, County Durham|Heighington]] in [[County Durham]] was chosen as the UK's "perfect village".

* Show 1. ''Introduction''
* Show 2. [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]] and [[Alderley Edge]] (Essex and the North West)
* Show 3. [[Bourton-on-the-Water]] and [[Ardglass]] (The West and Northern Ireland)
* Show 4. [[Rogart]] and [[Tonyrefail]] (Scotland and South Wales)
* Show 5. [[Heighington, County Durham|Heighington]] and [[Milton Abbas]] (the North and the South West)
* Shpw 6. [[Polperro]] and [[Wye, Kent|Wye]] (the South West and the South East)
* Show 7. [[Silver End]] and [[Poundbury]] (the East and the South West)
* Show 8. ''What makes the perfect village?''

==Responses==
The [[Channel 4]] programme, ''[[Demolition (television)|Demolition]]'', broadcast in December 2005, was an "answer" to ''Restoration''; instead of voting for a building to be saved, viewers were asked to vote on which eyesore should be demolished.

== Music ==
* The main theme music was composed by [[Nick Franglen]], who forms one half of ambient music duo [[Lemon Jelly]]. The Lemon Jelly track "In The Bath" was used as background music within the programmes.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The '''Aquitania''' is a luxury, 82-unit [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]] apartment building in the Margate Park neighborhood of the [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]] community of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It is officially designated on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by The United States Department of the Interior.

The Aquitania, known legally as the 5000 North Marine Drive Corporation, was built by [[Ralph C. Harris]] and [[Byron H. Jillson]] in the [[Classical Revival]] style. Its developer was [[George K. Spoor]], the co-founder of [[Essanay Studios]] and a producer of silent movies during the first two decades of the twentieth century. At that time, Chicago rivaled both [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]] in film production, and Spoor was able to use his considerable wealth to plan and develop a property, which he felt was befitting the celebrities connected with Chicago's growing entertainment industry.  A legend, which purports that Essanay Studio actors Charlie Chaplain and Gloria Swanson once resided at The Aquitania, is likely unfounded.  This probable factual inaccuracy reflects nothing more than film lore since all silent film production left Chicago's Essanay studios for southern California by 1918 at the very latest, and The Aquitania was not built until 1923, although there are historical accounts of both silent-film era stars staying as guests at The Aquitania when it was a hotel in its earliest days.

When the Aquitania was built, it was situated directly on the Lake Michigan shore; subsequent development of both [[Lake Shore Drive]] and the lakefront park have moved the shore some two blocks east of the building. The fifteen-story building has a courtyard and an [[Art Moderne]] lobby. Construction was completed in 1923, and it became a cooperative in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%c2%b3%5eX%e2%80%a0 Real estate Housing profiles The Aquitania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094859/http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%C2%B3%5EX%E2%80%A0 |date=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''timeline''' is a display of a list of events in [[chronological]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grafton | first= Anthony| authorlink= Anthony Grafton |last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Daniel | title = Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2010 | pages = 272 | isbn = 978-1-56898-763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically a [[graphic design]] showing a long bar labelled with [[calendar date|dates]] alongside itself and usually events. A [[Gantt chart]] is a form of timeline used in [[project management]].

Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data. Most timelines use a [[linear]] scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A [[timeline of evolution]] can be over millions of years, whereas a [[timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks]] can take place over minutes, and an explosion over milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2016/09/01/anomaly-updates|title=Anomaly Updates|last=plarson|date=2016-09-01|work=SpaceX|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most timelines use a linear timescale, for very large or small timespans, [[logarithmic timeline]]s use a logarithmic scale to depict time.

== Types ==
There are different types of timelines
* Text timelines, labeled as text
* Number timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly [[line graph]]s
* Interactive, clickable, zoomable

There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on [[graphic design]], and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.

Timelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. [[ChronoZoom]] is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software.

==Uses of timelines==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{main|List of timelines}}
Timelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject.  When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.

=== In historical studies ===
Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for [[biography|biographies]]. Examples include:

* [[Timeline of the American Civil Rights Movement]]
* [[Timeline of European exploration]]
* [[Timeline of imperialism]]
* [[Timeline of Solar System exploration]]
* [[Timeline of United States history]]
* [[Timeline of World War I]]
* [[Timeline of religion]]

=== In natural sciences===
Timelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, for subjects such as [[astronomy]], [[biology]], and [[geology]]:

*[[2009 flu pandemic timeline]]
*[[Chronology of the universe]]
*[[Geologic time scale]]
*[[Timeline of evolutionary history of life]]

=== In project management===
Another type of timeline is used for [[project management]]. In these cases, timelines are used to help team members to know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. For example, in the case of establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the [[Systems development life-cycle|life cycle of a computer system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Traditional trades''' (known also as '''traditional building trades''' and '''preservation trades''') is a loosely defined categorization of building trades who actively practice their craft in respect of [[historic preservation]], heritage conservation, or the conserving and maintenance of the existing [[built environment]]. Though traditional trade practitioners may at times be involved in new construction, the emphasis of the categorization is toward work on existing structures, regardless of their age or their historic value, with a specific interest in replication or conservation of the original results and craft techniques.

== Trade technologies ==
[[File:Timber Framing Circular Saw.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Modern timber framers incorporate new technologies, like the circular saw shown here, to increase productivity and reduce labor costs and time.]]Traditional building trades commonly include [[masonry]], [[timber framing]], log building, traditional [[Roofer|roofing]], [[carpentry]] and [[joiner]]y, [[plasterwork]], [[painting]], [[blacksmithing]], and ornamental metal working. In addition to "hands-on" skills and knowledge of building processes, traditional trade practitioners incorporate knowledge of historic preservation, materials science, historic architecture, and procuring replacement materials. Contemporary practitioners of traditional trades must also avail themselves of modern technologies, current materials science, and 21st century construction project management.

The work performed by these practitioners is not only essential to the maintenance of the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, lime burners, and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be “dying” arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, it is also true that these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all.

Traditional trades not only restore and help to maintain buildings, but also stabilize priceless archaeological sites, and in doing so, help us understand the techniques used at places like [[Cuzco]], [[Stonehenge]], and [[Angkor Wat]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Such trades are not solely practiced for the conservation of monumental heritage sites and can be applied to conserve vernacular sites such as barns.

== Materials technologies ==
The traditional trades focus on preservation of the knowledge of craft work specific to historic building technologies and traditional/non-traditional building materials. Traditional building materials and traditional trade technologies are commonly associated with a host of materials, but not limited to, stone, brick, [[terra cotta]], [[adobe]], cork, leather, timber and log, bamboo, thatch, [[slate]] and metal roofing, fine and vernacular carpentry, ornamental [[plaster]] ([[scagliola]]), [[stained glass]], window and door restoration, wood refinishing, painting, [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]]. In what may at times be considered non-traditional materials are found trades such as chandelier and lighting restoration where you have to be somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades with an understanding of electricity, and knowledgeable with properties and finishes of metals, glass, and optics. As an example of the mix of new and old materials, the art of restoration of mobile residential trailers requires a number of traditional trade skills associated with traditional and contemporary materials in a manner not dissimilar to those hand-work skills and preservation approaches required to restore an historic automobile, a biplane, rocket ship or steam locomotive.

== Green trades ==
Traditional building technologies tend towards a closer relationship of the built environment to an in-practice understanding, interaction and use of [[natural resources]] and recycled or salvaged building materials than is common in the practice of modern and contemporary building technologies.

For example: a traditional timber framer in search of difficult-to-acquire materials with which to rebuild heritage structures will tend to seek out an understanding of forest management, tree harvest, conversion process and building design and technique. These integrated skills and their supportive knowledge base both in scale and localization are readily adaptable to strategies of sustainable new-build economies.

Old buildings and structures were built once, energy and natural resources previously expended, and to adaptively re-use or recycle them often requires an understanding and appreciation of not only how the older materials with which they were built work together in a structure, but a need to understand the techniques by which these materials were originally worked, and an understanding of how they can most optimally be worked now.

== Knowledge of process ==
As opposed to an emphasis on [[materials science]] (as with an [[architectural conservator]]) the primary orientation of a traditional trade practitioner tends toward the in-process work activity and physical interaction and intervention with the building materials and the coordination, education and [[project management]] of in-field work teams.

== Team members ==
Traditional trades are quite often team members with architectural conservators, preservation architects and structural engineers in both the design phase investigation of heritage sites as well as involved directly in the undertaking of the hands-on restoration process. Traditional trades as a resource to the historic preservation industry provide a physical grounding in feasibility, construction logic, field and site logistics, reference to skilled traditional trades practitioners, estimate and budget considerations.

== Availability ==

Skilled traditional trades practitioners are generally available to preservationists and property stewards who give themselves a chance to find them. Besides the Internet and verbal networking, information about traditional trades can be found through trade associations and training programs, both private and governmental. If a particular job is limited to union workers, the union should provide workers with the appropriate skills or else allow an exception for a particular task.

A traditional trades practitioner may also be able to recommend experts in related skills, as well as promote good communications among the different disciplines at work on any given project.

== Education ==
Basic levels of training in contemporary building and craft skills are a prerequisite to specialization in traditional trades work. Individuals with an interest in learning a traditional trade can seek out learning opportunities either through formal vocational programs or through informal mentorship in at-work field practice under the tutelage of a traditional trade practitioner.

Family businesses, trade unions, historic preservation businesses, government programs ([http://www.nps.gov/training/HPTC/ National Park Service Historic Preservation Training Center]), college programs, religious and non-profit organizations are areas where an interest to provide education of traditional trade practice can often be found. As the individual increases in skill, learning will come from study, from workshops, from travel and personal contacts, and from clues found in the work itself.

Some individual tradespeople provide training opportunities for their fellow tradespeople without a close association with the larger educational institutions.

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

The '''Walam Olum''' or '''Walum Olum''', usually translated as "Red Record" or "Red Score," is purportedly a historical narrative of the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe. The document has provoked controversy as to its authenticity since its publication in the 1830s by [[botanist]] and [[antiquarian]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]]. [[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] studies in the 1980s and analysis in the 1990s of Rafinesque's [[manuscripts]] have produced significant evidence that the document is a hoax. Some Delaware people, however, believe Rafinesque based his writing on actual Lenape stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/lenape_culture.htm Lenape Nation: Lenape Culture], Native Languages&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Walamolum01.jpg|thumb|280px|Walam Olum pictograph]]

==The work==
In 1836 in his first volume of ''The American Nations'', Rafinesque published what he represented as an [[English (language)|English]] translation of the entire text of the ''Walam Olum'', as well as a portion in the [[Lenape language]].

The ''Walam Olum'' includes a [[creation myth]], a [[deluge myth]], and the narrative of a series of [[Human migration|migrations]]. Rafinesque and others claimed or interpreted the migrations to have begun in [[Asia]]. The Walam Olum suggested a migration over the [[Bering Strait]] took place 3,600 years ago.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;Jackson, Brittany and Mark Rose. [http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/hoaxes/walam_olum.html "Walam Olum Hokum."] ''Archaeology.'' 4 Dec 2009 (retrieved 26 Dec 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The text included a long list of chiefs' names, which appears to provide a timescale for the epic. According to Rafinesque, the chiefs appeared as early as 1600 [[BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rafinesque, C.S.,''The American nations; or, outlines of their general history, ancient and modern, including: the whole history of the earth and mankind in the western hemisphere; the philosophy of American history; the annals, traditions, civilization, lanuguages, &amp;c., of all the American nations, tribes, empires, and states '' 1836 p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XYlHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=rafinesque+chiefs+1600&amp;ei=QqR5S8WDLInwMozL4csE&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The story in summary===
The narrative begins with the formation of the universe, the shaping of the Earth, and the creation of the first people, by the Great [[Manitou]]. Then, as the Great Manitou creates more creatures, an evil manitou creates others, such as flies. Although all is harmonious at first, an evil being brings unhappiness, sickness, disasters and death. A great snake attacked the people and drove them from their homes. The snake flooded the land and made monsters in the water, but the Creator made a giant turtle, on which the surviving people rode out the flood, and prayed for the waters to recede. When land emerged again, they were in a place of snow and cold, so they developed their skills of house-building and hunting, and began explorations to find more temperate lands. Eventually, they chose to head east from the land of the Turtle to the land of the Snake, walking across the frozen ocean and first reaching a land of spruce trees.

After a few generations (from this point on, chiefs of the tribe are named), they began to spread into the adjoining territories. Many generations passed (the characteristics of each chief briefly described), until a large part of the nation decided to invade the territory of the Talegawi people, aided by the northern Talamatan. Although the invasion eventually succeeded, the Talamatan later became hostile, but were soon subdued, and a further long period of consolidation began. Slow expansion into the rich eastern lands eventually reached another sea, where, after generations, the first white men arrived in ships.

There the text ends, though Rafinesque did publish an additional "Fragment: On the History of the Linapis since abt. 1600, when the Wallamolum closes" which takes the story up to his own time. This (which incidentally names the composer of the original Walam Olum as one Lekhibit) exists only as a purported translation by John Burns, who has himself never been satisfactorily identified.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Leopold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVzI3z8NugkC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=%22rafinesque+%22john+burns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hskaj25aHs&amp;sig=UbjDpHu6erlO-ydJimuQ7PeEuVM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CU1KTdiLLcimhAem4MzlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rafinesque%20%22john%20burns%22&amp;f=false  ''Early nineteenth-century contributions to American Indian and general linguistics: Du Ponceau and Rafinesque''] Springer (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2506-2}}, p315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Rafinesque claimed the original narrative was recorded in pictographs on birch bark, or cedar wood tablets or sticks (Rafinesque explained that "Olum... implies a record, a notched stick, an engraved piece of wood or bark.")  He said "the late Dr. Ward of Indiana" acquired the materials in 1820 from a Lenape patient in return for a medical cure, and eventually passed them on to Rafinesque. From Rafinesque's personal notes and a family legend, this Dr. Ward was tentatively identified in 1954 as Dr John Russell Ward, a Kentucky physician who died in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;Weer, Paul (1954). "History of the Walam Olum Manuscript and Painted Records". In Voegelin, Charles F. (et al.) ''Walam Olum; or, Red Score, the Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape'', Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; but a potential Indiana candidate has been identified: Malthus A. Ward&lt;ref&gt;William Barlow and David O. Powell [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27790973 "The Late Dr. Ward of Indiana": Rafinesque's Source of the Walam Olum"] in ''Indiana Magazine of History'' Vol. 82, No. 2 (June 1986), pp. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; (1794–1863, so not "late" in the sense of "deceased") who spent some of his early career in Indiana, moved to New England in 1823 and from 1831 was professor of natural history at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2180 "Malthus Ward (1794-1863)"] in the ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Accessed 2010-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; He said the explanatory transcription of verses in the [[Lenape language]] came from a different source, in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Daniel G. (1885) ''The Lenâpé and their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum''&lt;/ref&gt; After his translation was published, Rafinesque said he lost the actual plaques.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

When Rafinesque wrote an essay on the Lenape language in October 1834, he did not mention the ''Walam Olum'' at all.  It was two months later that he submitted a supplement about it.  This was shortly after he acquired a list of authentic Lenape names compiled by [[John Heckewelder]].&lt;ref name="oestr"&gt;Oestreicher, David M. (1996) "Unraveling the Walam Olum", ''Natural History'' 105 (10):14–21. (also revised version in Boewe, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Rafinesque's translation of the 183 verses totals fewer than 3,000 words. In his manuscript he juxtaposed the pictographs with the verses in Lenape language that explained them. This material is now held at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and has been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Wallam-Olum: first and second parts of the painted and engraved traditions of the Linnilinapi / translated word for word by C. S. Rafinesque. [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/medren/2571471 UPenn Ms. Coll. 700, Item 217]&lt;/ref&gt; Any items in Rafinesque's large collection of specimens, which did not find a ready sale after his death were apparently destroyed. There is no evidence other than Rafinesque's testimony that the original sticks existed. Scholars have only his work to study.

Twentieth-century archaeology has confirmed that by Rafinesque's time, Native Americans had been using birch bark scrolls for over 200 years.  In 1965 the archaeologist Kenneth Kidd reported on two finds of "trimmed and fashioned pieces of birch bark on which have been scratched figures of animals, birds, men, [[myth]]ological creatures, and esoteric symbols" in the [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Head-of-the-Lakes]] region of [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]]. Some of these resembled scrolls used by the [[Midewiwin|Mide Society]] of the [[Ojibwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;  A scroll from one of these finds was later dated to about 1560 +/-70 [[common era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Rajnovich, Grace.

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 19th century==
While there was controversy about the ''Walam Olum'', it was treated as an accurate account by historians, [[anthropologist]]s, and archaeologists for many years.  [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim G. Squier]], widely regarded as an influential figure of American 19th-century [[archaeology]], republished the text in 1849. He accepted it as genuine, partially on internal evidence but also because the educated Indian chief (Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh) ([[George Copway]]), to whom he showed the manuscript, "unhesitatingly pronounced it authentic, in respect not only to the original signs and accompanying explanations in the Delaware dialect, but also in the general ideas and conceptions which it embodies. He also bore testimony to the fidelity of the translation." More recently, Barnhart noted that Copway was "fluent in his native dialect and knowledgeable of the traditions of the Ojibwa and other Algonquian groups such as the Lenape, but he was certainly not an expert on the traditions and language of the Delaware."&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1849, after the documented was republished, [[Henry Schoolcraft|Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] wrote to Squier that he believed the document is "well sustained by comparisons with such transcripts as I have obtained from bark scrolls, and the tabular pieces of wood called music boards".
 
In 1885, after the third printing,&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; the well-known [[ethnographer]] [[Daniel G. Brinton]] published a new translation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garrison Brinton, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 1885 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=jaZegQr677wC&amp;dq=rafinesque+walam+olum+&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f-A73ojqP2&amp;sig=OTQRiPltl-2am1E189ruL5lEV5E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ''The Lenâpé and Their Legends: With the Complete Text and Symbols of the Walam Olum. A New Translation, and an inquiry into its authenticity''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Brinton explained, "In several cases the figures or symbols appear to me to bear out the corrected translations which I have given of the lines, and not that of Rafinesque.  This, it will be observed, is an evidence, not merely that he must have received this text from other hands, but the figures also, and weighs heavily in favor of the authentic character of both."&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1885 edition may have been read by ethnographer and explorer [[James Mooney]]. Published in 1888, his ''[[Myths of the Cherokee]]'' references the ''Walum Olum.'' In his "Historical sketch of the Cherokee" at the beginning of the work he attempts to adduce the origins of the term 'Cherokee:' "...among other synonyms for the tribe are Rickahockan or Rechahecrian, the ancient Powhatan name, and Tallige', or Tallige'wi, the ancient name used in the ''Walam Olum'' chronicle of the Lenape'."&lt;ref name=Mooney1888&gt;Mooney, James. King, Duane (ed.). ''Myths of the Cherokee.'' Barnes &amp; Noble. New York. 1888 (2007). pp. 4 - 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' in the 20th century==
In the 1930s, [[Erminie Voegelin]] attempted to find evidence of ''Walam Olum'' narrative elements in independent Lenni-Lenape and Delaware sources; the parallels were at best inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Erminie W., "Cultural parallels," pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts about the text's authenticity began to grow. In 1952 renowned archaeologist [[James Bennett Griffin]] publicly announced that he “had no confidence in the 'Walam Olum'.”  Historian [[William A. Hunter]] also believed the text a hoax. In 1954 archaeologist [[John G. Witthoft]] found linguistic inaccuracies and suspicious correspondences of words in the texts to 19th-century Lenape-English word lists.  He concluded that Rafinesque composed the narrative from Lenape texts already in print.&lt;ref name="witt"&gt;Witthoft, John, 1955. "The Walam Olum Project", ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' Vol. 21, p194.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, he announced in the ''Journal of American Linguistics'' the start of a ''Walam Olum'' project for further study, but this project did not take place.&lt;ref name="witt"/&gt;

In 1954, a multidisciplinary team of scholars from the [[Indiana Historical Society]] published another translation and commentary.  They stated, "The 'Red Score' is a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture." A reviewer noted that the team was not able to identify Dr. Ward, and he concluded that the document's origins "are undeniably clouded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of "Walam Olum or Red Score. The  Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians. A New Translation,  Interpreted by Linguistic, Historical, Archaeological, Ethnological, and  that Physical Anthropological Studies"|journal=American Antiquity|date=October 1955|first=Richard  B.|last=Woodbury|volume=21|issue=2|pages=191–192|id=  |format=|doi=10.2307/276869|publisher=American Antiquity, Vol. 21, No. 2|jstor=276869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthropologist [[Della Collins Cook]] commented on the 1954 study, "The scholarly essays are best read as exercises in stating one's contradictory conclusions in a manner designed to give as little offense as possible to one's sponsor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Buikstra, Jane]] and Lane Beck, eds. ''Bioarchaeology: The Contextual Analysis of Human Remains'', Academic Press (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-12-369541-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other translations and commentaries have followed, including translations into languages other than English.

[[Selwyn Dewdney]], art educator and researcher into [[Ojibwa]] art and [[anthropology]], wrote the only comprehensive study of the Ojibwa birch bark scrolls (''[[wiigwaasabak]]oon''). In it he wrote: "A surviving [[pictographic]] record on wood, preserved by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Delaware long after they had been shifted from their original homeland on [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shores at the mouth of the [[Delaware River]], offers evidence of how ancient and widespread is the [[myth]] of a flood (see [[Deluge (mythology)]]) involving a powerful water ''[[manitou]]''. The record is known as the ''Walum Olum'' (Painted Sticks), and was interpreted for [[George Copway]] by a Delaware Elder... Apart from the reference to man's moral wickedness, the mood and imagery of the ''Walum Olum'' convey an archaic atmosphere that surely predates European Influence."&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, Selwyn. 1975. ''The Sacred Scrolls of the Southern Ojibway''. Glenbow Museum &amp; University Of Toronto Press. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of his study by the anthropologist Edward S Rogers states "Dewdney is apt to rely upon ethnographic generalizations that were in vogue a quarter of a century ago, but in the intervening years have been modified or disproven...Dewdney handles ethnohistorical matters no better than he does ethnographic topics... Dewdney has deceived the unwary that do not realize that the exact distributions and certain proposed migrations of Ojibwa still remain unresolved. A final word, but one that is of paramount importance, must be voiced. How will the [[Ojibwa]] react to this book? Most likely, negatively, from the few comments received to date. The fact that "Sacred" information is being divulged will be resented."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Edward S., ''Ethnohistory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, (Winter, 1975), pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky-based writer [[Joe Napora]] wrote a modern translation of the text, which was published in 1992. At the time he thought the ''Walam Olum'' was genuine.  In his preface, he wrote, "My belief is that the Walam Olum is closely related to the [[Midewiwin#Teaching scrolls|Mide Scrolls]] that Dewdney wrote so eloquently about in 'Sacred Scrolls of the Ojibway.'"&lt;ref&gt;Napora, Joe. ''The Walam Olum / as translated by Joe Napora''. Greenfield Center, NY: Greenfield Review Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-912678-82-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, however, ethnologists had collected enough independent information "to discount the ''Walam olum'' completely as a tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert C. Kraft]], an expert on the Lenape,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDF1331F934A15752C1A96E948260 "Lenape Expert Assails Phone Flier"], ''New York Times'' online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnj.org/herbert_c.html "Archaeological Society of New Jersey Lifetime Achievement Award"]&lt;/ref&gt; had long suspected the document to be a fraud. He stated that it did not square with the archaeological record of migrations by the prehistoric ancestors of the Lenape.  In addition, he cited a 1985 survey conducted among Lenape elders by ethnologists David M. Oestreicher and James Rementer that revealed traditional Lenape had never heard of the narrative. The older Lenape people said that they "found its text puzzling and often incomprehensible." Oestreicher examined the Lenape language text with fluent native speaker, Lucy Parks Blalock, and they found problems such as frequent use of English idioms.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

In 1991 Steven Williams summarized the history of the case and the evidence against the document, lumping it with many other famous archaeological frauds.  The existence of genuine historic pictogram documents elsewhere does not overcome the textual and ethnological problems of the ''Walam Olum''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Steven. ''Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Walam Olum'' since 1994==
In 1994, and afterwards, textual evidence that the Walam Olum was a hoax was supplied by David M. Oestreicher in “Unmasking the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Hoax.” Oestreicher examined Rafinesque's original manuscript and "found it replete with crossed-out Lenape words that had been replaced with others that better matched his English 'translation.' In other words, Rafinesque had been translating from English to Lenape, rather than the other way round".&lt;ref name="oestr"/&gt; In general, he found a variety of evidence that the ''Walam Olum'' was not an authentic historical record but was composed by someone having only a slight familiarity with the Lenape language. Oestreicher argued that Rafinesque crafted the linguistic text from specific sources on the Delaware Language published by the American Philosophical Society and elsewhere.  Further, he said that the supposedly "Lenape" pictographs were hybrids from published [[Egypt]]ian, [[China|Chinese]], and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] sources.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; 
Barnhart concurs, stating that "the pictographs are in no way comparable to the figures found on the stone carvings or [[petroglyphs]] found in ''[[Lenapehoking]]'', the traditional homeland of the Lenape.&lt;ref&gt;Barton: 140&lt;/ref&gt;  David Oestreicher asserted that the stories were a conglomerate assembled from numerous sources from different cultures that spanned the globe.  Barnhart was of the opinion that Rafinesque created the ''Walam Olum'' in hopes of winning the international ''Prix Volney'' contest hosted in [[Paris]], and Barnhart thought that Rafinesque wanted to prove his long-held theories regarding the peopling of America. Oestreicher’s findings were summarized by Herbert Kraft in his study, "The Lenape-Delaware Indian Heritage: 10,000 BCE to 2000 CE.", and by Jennifer M. Lehmann in "Social Theory as Politics in Knowledge".

Later David Oestreicher wrote that he had received a direct communication from Joe Napora.  Oestreicher wrote that Napora wrote, "[H]e now recognises that the 'Walam Olum' is indeed a hoax...and was dismayed that the sources upon whom he relied had been so negligent in their investigation of the document and that the hoax should have been continued as long as it has".&lt;ref name="oest2"&gt;Oestreicher, "Hoax," pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oestreicher's very detailed analyses have not found a wide audience, but they have made it possible to go a step further, and study the thinking and cultural assumptions of earlier researchers (for example by examining how they treated features of the ''Walam Olum'' which should have been clear evidence that it was a fake).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Walam Olum: An Indigenous Apocrypha and Its Readers|journal=American Literary History|year=2010|first=Andrew|last=Newman|volume=22|issue=1|pages=26–56|doi=10.1093/alh/ajp055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent biography of Rafinesque concluded: "There is now very good reason to believe that he fabricated important data and documents... The most egregious example is the Lenni Lenape migration saga, 'Walam Olum', which has perplexed scholars for one and a half centuries. Rafinesque wrote the 'Walam Olum' believing it to be ''authentic'' because it accorded with his own belief—he was merely recording and giving substance to what must be true. It was a damaging, culpably dishonest act, which misled scholars in search of the real truth, far more damaging than his childish creations, which could be easily dismissed; this was more than mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Leonard. 2005. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/081312316X ''Constantine Samuel Rafinesque: A Voice in the American Wilderness''.] Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2316-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional Lenape believe they have lived in their homeland (that is, in the [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] area) forever. The [[Delaware Tribe of Indians]], located in eastern Oklahoma, originally endorsed the document but withdrew their endorsement on February 11, 1997 after reviewing the evidence.&lt;ref name ="oest2"/&gt; The Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania emphasize their belief that they have been in the area for 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenapenation.org/lenapeculture.html Lenape Nation - A Tribal Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst concluding that the burden of proof lies on those who believe the ''Walam Olum'' to be authentic, Barnhart states that "whatever one's position on the 'Walam Olum', its controversial place in the history of American anthropology is most definitively secured."&lt;ref&gt;Barnheart, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference in literature ==
[[Paula Gunn Allen]]'s poetry collection, ''Shadow Country'', from 1982 contains a reference to the ''Walam Olum''. In Part II of the poem, ''ANOTHER LONG WALK'', it says:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quantify the myths''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''symbolic utterance of the Grandfather (Lenape)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count    /     years on the Red Score''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''wich does not''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''count for history''&lt;/blockquote&gt;"the Red Score" is the reference, and is also related to the mention of ''[[Lenape]]'' in line 2.
