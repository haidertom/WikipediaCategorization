'''Adaptxt''' is a [[predictive text]] application for [[mobile phones]], developed by [[KeyPoint Technologies]], a [[UK]]-based software company. The application is designed to improve text entry on mobile devices by making it faster and error-free. It achieves this by predicting the next word as well as the word being typed, continuously adapting to the user's writing-style and vocabulary.

==History and product features==
Launched in 2006, Adaptxt supported [[Windows Mobile]] [[smartphones]] only. Adaptxt provides features such as context-based next-word suggestions, word completion, personal dictionary, dynamic language detection, conversion from [[SMS]] language to standard [[English language|English]] and vice versa, multilingual text entry and a feature that learns new words and context while typing.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6121806.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Scotland &amp;#124; Glasgow and West &amp;#124; Jobs boost for text message firm |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application stores the new words in the user’s personal dictionary, where they can be edited. KeyPoint also claims that Adaptxt users can type in any of the installed languages without changing their keyboard language or dictionary, thanks to an engine capable of recognizing the language in use. This feature is supposed to be an added value for users who are bi-lingual or occasionally type in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomonews.com/kpt-identifies-351m-untapped-market-for-language-dictionaries-on-mobile-phones/ |title=KPT identifies $351m untapped market for language dictionaries on mobile phonesGoMo News |publisher=Gomonews.com |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version for [[Symbian S60]] smartphones was released in 2008, with improved support for third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Zach |url=http://www.bgr.com/2008/04/01/keypoint-releases-new-adaptxt-beta-for-s60/ |title=Keypoint Releases New Adaptxt Beta for S60 |publisher=BGR |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, KeyPoint introduced a feature to scan personal data, including calendar entries, phonebook contacts, SMS and email inbox and sent items. The “Scan Facebook” feature learns words from the user’s [[Facebook]] profile. The new words learnt are added to the personal dictionary and offered as suggestions during text entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://predictivetext.blogspot.com/2009/06/adaptxt-for-nokia-s60-smartphone-beta.html |title=Predictive Text: Adaptxt for Nokia S60 Smartphone (Beta v2.4) |publisher=Predictivetext.blogspot.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, KeyPoint also launched a new version of Adaptxt with [[error correction]]. This feature provides alternative suggestions for incorrect spellings. Automated correction of spelling mistakes were also made available, with an option to revert to the exact word entered by the user in case of unwanted corrections. All these features can now be found in the Symbian version of the product and most of them can also be found in the Windows Mobile version.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Keypoint Technologies (www.keypoint-tech.com) |url=http://www.adaptxt.com/ |title=Adaptxt |publisher=Adaptxt |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KeyPoint was also the first software company to introduce professional add-on dictionaries that provide industry-specific word and phrase suggestions related to a particular profession, such as medicine, law, IT and telecommunications, business and finance.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; Users can download additional language and professional dictionaries from the product website directly to their devices.

In May 2011, KeyPoint made Adaptxt [[Open-source software|open source]] through the project "OpenAdaptxt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openadaptxt.sourceforge.net/index.html |title=OpenAdaptxt |publisher=Openadaptxt.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-compatible version of the application has been launched in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlegreenrobot.co.uk/news/adaptxt-the-latest-best-android-keyboard/ |title=Adaptxt, the latest best Android keyboard? |publisher=Little Green Robot |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptxt supports both [[touch-screen]] and hard-keyboard devices with [[Telephone keypad|12-key]], 20-key or [[QWERTY]] layouts. On 12-key phones, Adaptxt offers both [[Multi-tap]] and [[Predictive]] entry modes.

More than 50 languages and respective keyboard layouts are supported by Adaptxt, including: [[American English|English US]], [[British English|English UK]], [[Languages of France|European French]], [[Canadian French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[European Spanish]], [[Latin-American Spanish]], [[European Portuguese]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hinglish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Kannada language|Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]].

'''Audience''' was an American mobile voice and audio-processing company based in [[Mountain View, CA|Mountain View]], [[California]], and was one of the 34 founding members of [[Open Handset Alliance|The Open Handset Alliance]]. They specialized in improving voice clarity and noise suppression for a broad range of consumer products, including [[cellular phones]], [[mobile device]]s and [[Personal computer|PC]]s. They were bought by Knowles for $85 Million in 3Q15 who changed their name to Knowles Intelligent Audio.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1326532&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience was the first company to have reverse-engineered the human hearing system and model its processes onto a chip, enabling computers and mobile devices to use the same kind of “auditory intelligence” that humans employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audience.com/component/zoo/item/audience-announces-next-generation-voice-processor-for-mobile-phones |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221701/http://www.audience.com/component/zoo/item/audience-announces-next-generation-voice-processor-for-mobile-phones |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using this technology in conjunction with two or more microphones, background noise is suppressed, improving the quality of the remaining voice and reducing distraction for the listener.&lt;ref&gt;http://phandroid.com/2010/01/11/nexus-one-voice-quality-victory-via-audience-a1026-voice-processor/&lt;/ref&gt; This technology mimics the “[[cocktail party effect]]”.

In 2010, Audience partnered with [[HTC]] to integrate their noise suppression technology into the Google [[Nexus One]] smartphone. The next year [[AT&amp;T]] introduced eight different handsets powered by Audience's earSmart technology including the [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Samsung Galaxy S III Skyrocket]] and the [[HTC Vivid]].

In 2013, [https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/audience-es515/ Audience unveiled its eS515], a combination voice processor and audio codec. This single slot solution enables device manufacturers to streamline their designs, negating the need for a separate voice processor and codec.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/show/6554/audience-announces-3rd-generation-sound-processor-es515&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The company’s core technology reduces background noise and [http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/120043-samsung-galaxy-s4-features-explored improves voice clarity on smartphones], computers and tablets. The company’s technology has shipped in more than 140 devices including the Nexus One, [[Samsung Galaxy]] S, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note, the iPhone4 and 4S, and the LG G2. Audience also works with other mobile phone manufacturers such as Huawei, Google, HTC, Sharp, Pantech, ZTE and others. In 2010, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131101154321/http://audience.com/news/press-releases/item/audience-brings-advanced-audio-noise-suppression-to-att-mobile-devices the company announced a collaboration with AT&amp;T] to deliver its advanced voice capabilities to AT&amp;T devices and is engaged with multiple operators around the world. Most recently the company announced its first design implementation in the PC space with the [http://technoodling.net/dell-vostro-5460-launched-an-ultrabook-with-2gb-nvidia-graphics-for-36k/ Dell Vostro 5460.]

==Products  ==

They had two lines of processors, Advanced Voice  and Smart Sound, both branded as [http://audience.com/products/what-is-earsmart "earSmart."] Advanced Voice processors come in a variety of models, the eS110 (supports 1 microphone), eS305 and eS310 (supports 2 microphones) and the company’s latest generation eS325 (supports 3 microphones), which was announced at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2013.

Smart Sound processors combined the Advanced Voice processor feature set (HD call quality, wideband noise suppression, bandwidth expansion, acoustic echo cancelation, and improved performance for Automatic Speech Recognition) with a stereo audio codec. The company introduced its Smart Sound processor category at Consumer Electronics Show 2013 with the launch of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140121035454/http://audience.com/press-releases/item/audience-introduces-the-earsmart-es515-the-world-s-first-smart-sound-processor eS515].

==Technology==

The company’s technology was built around the foundation of [[Computational auditory scene analysis|Computational Auditory Scene Analysis]] (CASA) -- a field of study that builds on the concept of [[Auditory scene analysis|Auditory Scene Analysis]] (ASA), a term first coined by psychologist [[Albert Bregman]]. ASA enables humans to accurately group sounds—even when composed of multiple frequencies, as in music, or when heard simultaneously –- and avoid blending "sources." As a result, ASA allows the listener to correctly distinguish and identify a sound of interest, like a voice, from other noise sources.

CASA attempts to recreate sound source separation in the same manner as human hearing, but in machines. Using the principles of CASA, Audience’s earSmart processors act like a human [[cochlea]] and group different sounds, based on a diverse list of cues such as pitch, onset/offset time, spatial location and harmonicity.   These simultaneous sounds are evaluated and grouped by source. In doing this, the microphones of a mobile device, together with Audience's proprietary "Fast Cochlea Transform" technology, can identify and group sounds which are classified as noise, remove or at least reduce them, and leave the remaining clear voice signal intact.

==Applications==

Beyond voice and video calls, this technology has been proven to improve the reliability and task completion rate of ASR (automatic speech recognition) in noisy environments as well as improve the quality and usability of media capture functions. Outside of the smartphone, tablet and mobile PC space, [http://seekingalpha.com/article/901351-audience-trading-at-cash-value Audience is said to be targeting the Smart TV and Automotive markets where voice is becoming more commonplace as a form of user interface].

==Awards==
Audience was the Silver Winner in the 2008 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Awards and the Winner of the Semiconductor category.  The company was included in Gartner’s “Cool Vendors in Semiconductors, 2008” and selected as the Most Innovative True Mobile Start-Up for the “2008 GSMA Mobile Innovation Global Awards.”

'''Automatic Tracking Satellite Dishes''' are [[satellite dish]]es used while a vehicle is in motion. Automatic tracking satellite dishes utilize [[gyroscopes]], [[GPS]] position sensors, and uses unique satellite identification data and an integrated [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] decoder to aid in identification of the satellite that it is pointing at.

The dishes consist usually of [[stepper motor]]s to drive and aim the dish, [[gyroscopes]] to detect changes in position while the vehicle is in motion, a [[parabolic reflector]], [[low-noise block converter]], and control unit.

'''Brigade Media''', also known as '''Brigade''', is a civic technology [[computing platform|platform]] that was formed on June 4, 2014, and founded by James Windon, Jason Putorti, John Thrall, Matt Mahan, and Miche Capone. The platform is intended to serve as a way for users to connect with others who share the same or similar views and voice their opinions, create [[debates]], or organize [[petitions]]. This process is intended to make the users' concerns more visible to and influential towards United States' [[policymakers]].

==Leadership==

James Wendon is the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of the Brigade platform. He previously acted as the [[Vice president (corporate title)|Vice President]] of Causes and earlier worked with the [[World Trade Organization]] in Switzerland. Matt Mahan is the [[CEO]] of Brigade and previously served as the [[CEO]] of [[Causes (company)|Causes]]. John Thrall works in [[Engineering]], Jason Putorti works in [[Design]], and Miche Capone specializes in [[Production (economics)|Production]]. [[Sean Parker]] is the [[Chairman]] of the [[startup company|startup]]. He sits on the board of [[Spotify]] and was the founding president of [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sifry, Micah|language=en-US|title=Charge of the Light Brigade: Is Sean Parker's Civic Startup Too Male and White?|url=http://techpresident.com/news/25152/charge-light-brigade-sean-parkers-civic-startup-too-male-and-white|website=techpresident.com|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Brigade President James Windon|author=Delargy, Christine|access-date=2014-04-10|website=The Washington Post|language=en-US|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-live/wp/2015/11/13/meet-brigade-president-james-windon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 2014-2016: Private Beta ===
On June 4th, 2014, Brigade Beta became available to download on [[iOS]] or [[Google Play]], in its private [[beta]] version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this beginning stage, the app asked users to agree or disagree on a position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brigade then split up its users into those who agreed on the issue and those who disagreed on the issue. Participants were also allowed to write their own opinions on positions and ask those in their respective group if they were "for" or "against" the opinion stated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Sean Parker’s new political app Brigade has launched in private beta|author= Wright, Mic|access-date=2018-04-10|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/17/sean-parkers-new-political-app-brigade-has-launched-in-private-beta/?via=indexdotco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016-present: Open Beta  ===
==== Voter guide ====
A few weeks before the November 2016 elections, Brigade created a ballot [[guide]] for its users.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It ran these voter guides in [[San Francisco]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citeweb|language=en-US|title=Brigade, The Political Engagement Platform Backed By Sean Parker, Launches A Voter Guide For Nov. Elections|author= Cutler, Kim-Mai|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/brigade/?via=indexdotco|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the user entered the [[Application software|application]], he or she was prompted with questions regarding [[government]] and [[social]] issues. One could agree, disagree, or click unsure as their answer choices.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade tries to provide a simple solution to elections, but is it too simple?|author= Hockenson, Lauren|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/14/brigade-tries-to-provide-a-simple-solution-to-elections-but-is-it-too-simple/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the questionnaire, the guide gave recommendations on who to vote for and which [[propositions]] to pass or not pass.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, the app also determined these choices based on those a user socializes with on Brigade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade launches first of its kind social ballot guide for U.S. voters|website=brigade.news|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigade users could then pledge their votes to the candidates and propositions listed on the ballot. With these pledges, the app could track which candidates had more pledged votes in real time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Users were further able to recruit pledges from other users for their favorite candidates or propositions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Voter verification==== 
Brigade implemented a voter [[Third-party verification|verification]] service as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=
With voter verification, Brigade becomes a more legitimate platform for political debate|author=Cutler, Kim-Mai|website=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/brigade-voter-verification/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With voter verification, a user can determine how similar or different a political representative's viewpoints are from their own.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; This data was received from [[Google API|Google's Civic API]] with geographic information on 520,000 American elected officials.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

==== Acquisitions ====

Brigade Media has acquired [[Causes_(company)|Causes]],[[Votizen]], and Voter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tech.co/brigade-acquires-votizen-and-causes-2014-06|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes and Votizens, Adds Tons of Executives|website=Tech.co|language=en-US|author=Schmidt, Will|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brigade acquires politics matchmaking service Voter, plans to shutter service later this year|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/brigade-acquires-politics-matchmaking-service-voter-plans-to-shutter-service-later-this-year/?via=indexdotco|website=venturebeat.com|language=en-US|author=Yeung, Ken|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|author=Wilhelm, Alex|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes In Its Quest To Revitalize American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/sean-parkers-brigade-media-acquires-causes-in-its-quest-to-revitalize-american-democracy/|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Causes was the largest [[online]] platform where candidates could [[Political campaign|campaign]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Votizen functioned as a [[tool]] for voters to learn more about their leaders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Voter aimed to put voters and politicians together via shared viewpoints.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These three companies helped Brigade gain [[social media]] presence and find intelligent [[workers]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade Welcomes Voter Founder &amp; CEO
|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-welcomes-voter-founder-ceo-ad89487519a8|website=brigade.news|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
As technology has advanced, it was assumed that the average individual would have further access to voting, and therefore, voting numbers would increase. Instead, voter turnout at the elections remains low, with numbers at the presidential elections between 50% and 60% of the US population in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828 - 2012|author= Peters, Gerhard and Woolley, John T.|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|website=presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the midterm election of 2014, only 36.4% of people voted, the lowest percentage since 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Midterm Elections Hits 72-Year Low|author= Alter, Charlotte|url=http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/|website=Time|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that civic technology will incentivize and educate its users to vote. Brigade's voter ballot was an attempt as a [[Civic technology|civic technology platform]] to increase voter participation as well as educate its users about candidates and propositions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The tools we build in Silicon Valley represent the best hope for fixing our democracy|author=Mahan Matt|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/2/1/14476462/civic-tech-organize-march-change-citizen-engagement-democracy-brigade|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
One mission of Brigade Media is to act as a [[foreground]] for its users to connect and organize so that they can voice their opinions on our nation's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media|url=https://parker.org/initiatives/brigade-media|website=parker.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more general goal is to increase voter participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Parker forms Brigade Media to charge politics|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/11/sean-parker-brigade-politics/10326463/|website=usatoday.com|author=Guynn, Jessica|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Brigade interacts with American [[voters]] by linking its users to the same held concerns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade-Make Change Into Action|url=https://brigade.com|website=brigade.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of [[elected officials]] on those concerns will be provided and metrics about the [[candidate]] most similar in concerns and degree of concern will be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Seeks To Reboot Political Engagement In America With Civic Social Media|author= Howard, Alexander|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-howard/brigade-seeks-to-reboot-political-engagement_b_7607306.html|website=huffingtonpost|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data should be useful for both candidates and voters, in that voters can voice their grievances and candidates must respond accordingly.

==Funding==
In 2014, Brigade Media received about $9.5 million in [[seed money]] from [[Sean Parker]], [[Marc Benioff]], and [[Ron Conway]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Brigade Beta, Sean Parker's civic-focused social network|url=https://mashable.com/2015/06/17/sean-parker-brigade-beta-civics-social/?via=indexdotco#lp4nVNPhzuqj|author=Mangalindan, JP|website=mashable.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media Raises $9.3M From Sean Parker To Shake Up American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/brigade-media-raises-9-3m-from-sean-parker-to-shake-up-american-democracy/|author=Wilhelm, Alex|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

===Criticism===
[[Barbara Simons]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[IBM]], asserts that all current forms of digital voting devices are hackable, and that the best unhackable option is paper.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Computer Scientist Who Prefers Paper|access-date=2014-04-17|website=theatlantic.com|language=en-US|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/guardian-of-the-vote/544155/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, a Canadian study revealed that online voting platforms may not improve voter participation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The study found that those who did not already vote on paper ballots did not vote with digital devices.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Instead, non-paper voting forms are simply more convenient for those who would have already decided to vote.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Now the Time for Internet Voting?:BC’s Independent Panel on Internet Voting|access-date=2014-04-17|website=revparl.ca|language=en-US|author=Archer, Keith|url=http://www.revparl.ca/37/4/37n4e_14_Archer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this [[data]] brought to light, the Independent Panel On Internet Voting did not recommend internet voting to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Election Task Force Report: 2017 Jun 28|access-date=2014-04-17|website=council.vancouver.ca|language=en-US|url=http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Brigade's [[Executive Chairman]], [[Sean Parker]], was the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of [[Facebook]] in mid-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students' Start-up Draws Attention and $13 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/students-startup-draws-attention-and-13-million.html|author=Rosen, Ellen|website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Facebook]] sold information on over 50 million Facebook users to [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|author=Rosenberg, Matthew, Confessore, Nicholas, and Cadwalldr, Carole |website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Parker's previous relationship with Facebook could provide controversy in his work with Brigade Media and his other projects.

At the company's formation, Brigade Media also faced a [[racial]] controversy. When Brigade was only a few weeks old, the entire [[Leadership|leadership division]] of the [[start-up]] was white males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The company addressed the issues by filling in 12 additional positions and noting that women were also present in the [[organization]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Results==

When the ballot guide was introduced, about 67% of its users were [[millennials]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This is an accomplishment because millennial participation in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]] had declined.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Results Are In on Sean Parker's Brigade App: Millennial Voters Used It|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/11/5/11620390/election-results-are-in-on-sean-parkers-brigade-app-millennial-voters|author=Chmielewski, Dawn|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the ballot guide, the [[start-up]] had 100,000 pledged candidates and 400,000 friends of candidates also pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Launches First of Its Kind Social Ballot Guide for U.S. Voters|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|website=brigade.news|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The platforms data also saw [[Donald Trump]] winning swing states before the polls in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States Presidential Election]].&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite web|title=An App Called Brigade Saw Trump Winning Swing States When Polls Didn't|access-date=2014-04-17|website=npr.org|language=en-US|author=Shahani, Aarti|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/10/501613521/an-app-saw-trump-winning-swing-states-when-polls-didnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Brigade had 200,000 [[verified]] users. Within the vote pledges, 94.5% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] pledged to vote for Republican nominee Trump, with 2.2% pledging with Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; However, on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] pledge side, only 55% pledged for Clinton while 40% of Democrats pledged for Trump.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">A '''colloid mill''' is a machine that is used to reduce the particle size of a [[solid]] in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] in a [[liquid]], or to reduce the droplet size of a liquid suspended in another liquid.  Colloid mills work on the rotor-stator principle: a rotor turns at high speeds (2000 - 18000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;).  The resulting high levels of [[hydraulic]] [[stress (physics)|shear]] applied to the process liquid disrupt structures in the fluid. Colloid mills are frequently used to increase the stability of suspensions and [[emulsion]]s, but can also be used to reduce the particle size of solids in suspensions&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;. Higher shear rates lead to smaller droplets, down to approximately 1 [[micrometre|µm]]&lt;ref name=FoodEmul /&gt; which are more resistant to emulsion separation.

Colloid mills are used in the following industries:
* Pharmaceutical&lt;ref name=remington /&gt;
* Cosmetic&lt;ref name=cosmetic /&gt; 
* Paint
* Soap
* Textile
* Paper
* Food&lt;ref name=FoodEmul /&gt;

[[Domestic robot]]s can vary widely in their capabilities and tasks. [[Sensor]]s include: cliff or stair sensors, motion sensors, [[Ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic object sensors]], dirt sensors, [[Infrared|IR]] sensors, and more. Intelligence varies also. Some have none while others can map out their environment and maneuver using complex [[algorithms]].

A [[railway]] or [[railroad]] is a [[Track (rail transport)|track]] where the vehicle travels over two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[steel]] [[I-beam|bars]], called [[Rail profile|rails]]. The rails   support and guide the wheels of the vehicles, which are traditionally either [[train]]s or [[tram]]s. Modern [[light rail]] is a relatively new innovation which combines aspects of those two modes of transport. However fundamental differences in the track and wheel design are important, especially where trams or light railways and trains have to share a section of track, as sometimes happens in congested areas.

== Terminology ==
 [[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|300px|A flanged wheel on a train]]

Both trams and trains  have [[flange]]d iron [[wheel]]s with a horizontal section transferring the vehicle  weight to the rail and a vertical flange "inboard" to guide the vehicle along the rail using its inside edge.

==Difference in technique in curves==
[[Tram|Rail vehicle]] wheels are usually mounted on a solid [[axle]], so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually achieved by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as [[Ackermann steering geometry]].

Trains and trams can turn corners without wheel-slip because the outer horizontal part of the wheels has a slightly [[Cone (geometry)|tapered]] [[Rim (wheel)#Railroad usage|rim]]. The guide [[flange]] (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly [[wiktionary:convex|convex]] top of a steel [[Rail profile|rail]] in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.

With both tram and train wheels, this happens naturally because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter is a few millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run straight. The wheel flange presses against the side of the curved rail so the "contact point" between rail and wheel moves a few [[millimeter]]s outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are [[cant (road/rail)|canted]], but not as well on tight curves and railway [[Railroad switch|switches]] (also known as "points"). This is because the [[Track geometry|geometry]] or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.

City trams often use tight curves - sometimes with a [[Minimum railway curve radius|radius]] of much less than about {{convert|20|m|1}}, and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or [[pedestrian zones]] or [[sidewalk]]s, so the track often has to be flush with the [[road surface]] or pavement. In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow&lt;!-- Yea right, who rolls those? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that the rim of the flange can take most of the weight, the "out-board" tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

In contrast, a train wheel is almost never designed to transfer weight through the flange rim, and some train wheels may be damaged if this should happen even once.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

== Track junctions ==
[[Image:Strijkregel in wissel.jpg|thumb|Right, the guard rail, which prevents the opposite wheel from [[Derailment|derailing]] on the [[Railroad turnout#Frog .28common crossing.29|frog]] common crossing at the left.]]

The point where two straight but intersecting railroads cross is called a [[Railroad turnout#Frog .28common crossing.29|frog]]. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges to pass through the intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the frog point gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a [[railway switch]]. This works on the same principle, except that the inner rail is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.

With a train this problem is solved by using a wide tire. Train [[Rail profile|rails]] usually cross at a shallow [[angle]]. In the middle of the interchange there is a supporting frog. The tire is guided on each side by guide rails and some portion of the tire always maintains rail contact. This method is not feasible with trams and light railways.{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Tram tires are generally narrower than train tires. Trams use bigger crossing angles and tighter [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve radii]] are more likely than for train tracks. To cope with this difficulty the wheels of trams temporarily transfer the weight of the tram onto the flange to reduce wear on both the frog point and the horizontal surface of the tram wheels. Train wheels are not designed to bear such weight on their flanges.&lt;!-- That's all nonsense --&gt;{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A tram wheel which runs on the flange rather than on the horizontal tyre has a larger effective diameter, so the distance travelled per revolution is greater. On the outside track of the curve this is an advantage. It may be necessary to compensate the inner wheel or allow for some slippage. Modern trams and trams tend to have thicker and wider tires which allow for a greater (horizontal) conical section and so greater effective diameter variation and turning ability.

== Interoperability problems ==
[[Image:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|200px|Difference in form and profile of the wheel and the rail of a train (left, blue) and a tram (right, green).]]
At the [[Junction (rail)|junctions]] of [[Track (rail transport)|train tracks]], the gap in the frog or switch rail is wide. &lt;!-- and deep.  Because train wheels are larger and wider and the flanges do not have to carry vertical loads, they can be designed to cope with gaps in the rail which might defeat the smaller tram-wheels.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  So [[tram]]s can be accommodated.
&lt;!-- Since tram flanges are generally unable to carry the weight of the vehicle, a tram with traditional wheels cannot drive on train rails without "falling into the gap" designed for the flanges of train cars on the crossing line. Modern [[light rail]], [[tram]], or [[tram-train]] equipment, using tram rails in city centers, and on interurban sections of train railroads now have interoperable flanges combined with wide tires. {{Clarify|date=May 2014}}--&gt;
&lt;!--what is an interoperable flange? this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;

The main problem with a train on tram rails is the relatively narrow width of frog and switch gaps and [[Groove (engineering)|channels]] of the [[groove rail]]s designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels &lt;!-- on the crossing line --&gt;. The wider flanges of train wheels increase the risk of derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of [[Trams in The Hague|The Hague]]), wider &lt;!-- and deeper --&gt; grooves  are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved [[girder rail]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirthrail.com/en/product_girder.htm Wirth Girder Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm Grooved or girder rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231441/http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantictrack.com/international/espanol/pdf/MRT_Brochure.pdf MRT Track &amp; Services Co., Inc / Krupp, T and girder rails, scroll down.]&lt;/ref&gt; A larger [[structure gauge]] would also be required &lt;!-- , requiring greater care and lower speeds for both types of vehicle.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  This was also done in [[Pacific Electric|Los Angeles]] and in [[British Columbia Electric Railway|Vancouver]] as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and [[Minimum railway curve radius|tight curves]], on tram tracks will also prevent [[train]]s from using tram tracks.

In North America the groove would have to be a minimum of {{convert|2+1/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide and by extension, the maximum distance between the inside faces of the guard flanges of the grooved rails can be no more than {{convert|52+1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}, see below.

 Design tolerances
 Design tolerances that affect the lateral displacement of the body include the following:	
1. Lateral tolerance between wheels and rails	
Two types of flanges are permitted on railroad wheels - narrow and wide. The maximum
lateral movement T1 possible for a new wheel set centered on in-gage track is a function of
the flange type and is determined by the following formula:	
CAUTION: Use only English Units in Formulas in this Recommended Practice	

 T1 = .5[gt-(gw+2fn)]
 = .59375” ({{convert|0.59375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}})  for narrow-flange wheels
 = .375" ({{convert|0.375|in|mm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide-flange wheels	

Where: gt = standard track gage at a point “5/8” ({{convert|5/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) below top of rail = 56.5" ({{convert|56.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
gw = minimum gage of wheel set between backs of flanges = 53” ({{convert|53|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
fn = minimum thickness of new wheel flange = 1.15625” ({{convert|1.15625|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for narrow flange or = 1.375" ({{convert|1.375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide flange

The '''Digital Humanitarian Network''' is a network-of-networks, enabling a consortium of Volunteer and Technical Communities (V&amp;TCs) to interface with [[humanitarian organization]]s that seek their services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanitarians.com/: DHNetwork] Main website for the consortium: [http://digitalhumanitarians.com/ digitalhumanitarians.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As a community-based network, the DHN has a growing list of member-groups and organizations.

== Mission ==

The '''Digital Humanitarian Network'''’s (DHNetwork) website was launched on April 9, 2012 by its co-founders:

* Andrej Verity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.veritythink.com/: "Verity Think"] Blog from Andrej Verity.&lt;/ref&gt; [[OCHA]]
* Patrick Meier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irevolution.net/bio/: Patrick Meier's Biography] from Blog iRevolution.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://irevolution.net/ iRevolution]

The purpose is to '''support humanitarian organizations''' in their '''[[disaster response]]''' efforts around the world.&lt;ref name="newswatch.nationalgeographic"&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/12/19/digital-disaster-response/: "Digital Disaster Response to Typhoon Pablo"] by Patrick Meier.&lt;/ref&gt; The network consists of member '''V&amp;TCs''' (entities that manage networks of technically trained volunteers around the globe, who can be activated to backstop disaster response operations and produce information with limited turn over time). These groups have a wide range of skills from [[GIS]] mapping, crowdsourcing, and data analysis and collection, to volunteer management and process design. The DHNetwork puts groups that have existed for years under one umbrella and provides a single outlet for traditional responders to access the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techchange.org/2012/10/16/activation-successful-the-digital-humanitarian-network-simulation-at-iccm/: "Activation Successful: The Digital Humanitarian Network Simulation at ICCM"] at TechChange.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In recent crises, like the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], members of online technology communities have cooperated to gather, process and share crucial information resources to help [[aid agencies]] on the ground, without contributing to 'data noise', by focusing on the information needs of aid agencies and other responders. This collective action was recognised and legitimized after the Haiti earthquake when volunteer communities established a ''''network of networks'''' with the aim of concentrating the abilities online responders on the most urgent information needs during each new emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/02/crisis-mapping-haiti/: "How Crisis Mapping Saved Lives in Haiti"] by Patrick Meier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DHNetwork''', has been created precisely in order to coordinate their action&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapaction.org/more-news/300-teaming-up-with-the-digital-humanitarians.html: Article: "Teaming up with the Digital Humanitarians"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartdatacollective.com/kathryn1723/106266/big-data-natural-solution-disaster-relief: "Big Data: A Natural Solution for Disaster Relief"] by Kathryn Kelly.&lt;/ref&gt;  with, at its heart, a [http://digitalhumanitarians.com/coordinators '''coordinator's group''']. The network brings together many of the major V&amp;TCs thereby increasing their visibility both amongst themselves and amongst the traditional humanitarian community, and has defined a '''clear activation process''' between the VT&amp;Cs and coordinators, so that traditional organizations are able to submit one request and rely on the DHNetwork to build a '''solution team''' with the relevant V&amp;TC members. DHNetwork also makes it simpler for organizations to define collaborative projects with the V&amp;TCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowdsourcing.org/document/digital-humanitarian-network-established-by-crowdsource-community/16468/: "Digital Humanitarian Network"]&lt;/ref&gt; As Jacobo Quintanilla underlines it: "humanitarian actors too, are finally adopting some of these tools (i.e. crowdsourcing and mapping tools) more systematically within their work, relying on input from affected populations", citing initiatives such as the DHNetwork as an example "to create important inroads in the way aid organisations leverage technology and the power of VT&amp;Cs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/03/disaster-communications-ict-internews: "Disaster communications: covering the ‘last mile’"] by Jacobo Quintanilla.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Humanitarian Network Coordinators ==

The DHNetwork is composed of several members who form '''Solution Teams''' when the network is activated. DHNetwork Coordinators review '''activation requests''' and rapidly liaise with the different volunteer &amp; technical teams who are members of Digital Humanitarians to build a Solution Team best able to act on a request. The Coordinators aim to provide a response to every request within 24 hours.

'''The Current Coordinators of the DHNetwork are''':

== Previous activations ==

In the past year, the '''DHNetwork''' has been activated five times by '''OCHA South Sudan, ACAPS, OCHA Philippines, Samoa government''' and '''UNHCR (Syria)'''. In each case, the requesting entity sent a central request to the DHNetwork. These efforts resulted in such things as rapid data collection, social media filters to augment traditional assessments, and a translation of the UNHCR Syria portal into Arabic allowing regional civilians to access normally inaccessible information.

1) [http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/ocha-south-sudan-deployment-curating-data-for-preparedness/ '''OCHA South Sudan''']. Searching the internet for 3 days looking for reports, articles, and data, the team collected 15,271 unique pieces of information.

2) [http://www.acaps.org/ '''ACAPS''']. The team surveyed the internet for Democratic Republic of Congo-related assessments, population statistics, historical IDP numbers, humanitarian events, and indicator values. The group also created several maps.

3) [http://digitalhumanitarians.com/profiles/blogs/typhoon-pablo '''OCHA Philippines''']. The [http://www.unocha.org/ United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) activated the DHNetwork on December 5, 2012, to track the real-time effects of [[Typhoon Pablo]] in the Philippines and collect all relevant tweets about the typhoon; identify pictures and videos of damage/flooding shared in those tweets; geolocate, time stamp, and develop real-time maps of displaced people, fatalities, crop damage, broken bridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartdatacollective.com/kathryn1723/106266/big-data-natural-solution-disaster-relief: "Big Data: A Natural Solution for Disaster Relief"] by Mike Smitheman.&lt;/ref&gt; The team searched through over 20,000 social media messages within 24 hours of the crisis for photos and videos. Results were compiled and organized in a structured database. The Solution team used a variety of methods ranging from automated algorithms to micro-tasking. They used [http://corp.geofeedia.com/ Geofeedia] to identify all relevant pictures/videos that were already geo-tagged by users, [https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa PyBossa] and a free and [[open-source]] [[Microwork#Microtasking|microtasking]] platform. UN OCHA published a map that is entirely sourced from social media analysis.&lt;ref name="newswatch.nationalgeographic" /&gt;

4) '''UNHCR (Syria)'''. Translation of UNHCR’s English portal to Arabic, which allows responders, refugees (2 million), internally [[Displaced person|displaced populations]], the global public, and professionals easier access to information.

'''Digital component video''' is defined by ITU-R BT.601 (formerly CCIR 601) standard and uses the [[YCbCr|Y'CbCr]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=YCbCr&amp;i=55147,00.asp PC Magazine Encyclopedia: YCbCr]&lt;/ref&gt; colorspace. Like [[Component video|Analog Component Video]] it gets its name from the fact that the video signal has been split into two or more components, that are then carried on multiple conductors between devices. Digital component video is slowly becoming popular in both computer and home-theatre applications. Component video is capable of carrying signals such as [[480i]], [[480p]], [[576i]], [[576p]], [[720p]], [[1080i]] and [[1080p]], although many TVs do not support 1080p through component video.

When digital electronic computers appeared, they displaced all other kinds of computers, including [[analog computer]]s and [[mechanical computer]]s]]

In [[computer science]], a '''digital electronic computer''' is a [[computer]] machine which is both an [[electronic computer]] and a [[digital computer]]. Examples of a digital electronic computers include the [[IBM PC]], the [[Apple Macintosh]] as well as modern [[smartphone]]s. When computers that were both [[digital computer|digital]] and electronic appeared, they displaced almost all other kinds of computers, but [[computation]] has historically been performed in various non-digital and non-electronic ways: the [[Lehmer sieve]] is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, while [[analog computer]]s are examples of non-digital computers which can be electronic (with [[analog electronics]]), and [[mechanical computer]]s are examples of non-electronic computers (which may be digital or not). An example of a computer which is both non-digital and non-electronic is the ancient [[Antikythera mechanism]] found in [[Greece]]. All kinds of computers, whether they are digital or analog, and electronic or non-electronic, can be [[Turing complete]] if they have sufficient [[computer memory|memory]]. A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[programmable computer]], a [[stored program computer]], or a [[general purpose computer]], since in essence a digital electronic computer can be built for one specific application and be non-reprogrammable. As of 2014, most [[personal computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s in people's homes that use [[multicore]] [[central processing unit]]s (such as [[AMD FX]], [[Intel Core i7]], or the multicore varieties of [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based chips) are also [[parallel computer]]s using the [[MIMD]] (multiple instructions - multiple data) paradigm, a technology previously only used in digital electronic [[supercomputer]]s. As of 2014, most digital electronic supercomputers are also [[cluster computer]]s, a technology that can be used at home in the form of small [[Beowulf cluster]]s. Parallel computation is also possible with non-digital or non-electronic computers. An example of a parallel computation system using the [[abacus]] would be a group of [[human computer]]s using a number of abacus machines for computation and communicating using [[natural language]].

A digital computer can perform its operations in the [[decimal]] system, in [[binary number|binary]], in [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] or in other [[numeral system]]s. As of 2014, all digital electronic computers commonly used, whether [[personal computer]]s or [[supercomputer]]s, are working in the binary number system and also use [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]. A few [[ternary computer]]s using [[ternary logic]] were built mainly in the [[Soviet Union]] as research projects.

A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[transistorized computer]]: before the advent of the [[transistor]], computers used [[vacuum tube]]s. The transistor enabled electronic computers to become much more powerful, and recent and future developments in [[digital electronics]] may enable humanity to build even more powerful electronic computers. One such possible development is the [[memristor]].

People living in the beginning of the 21st century use digital electronic computers for [[computer storage|storing]] [[data]], such as [[photograph|photo]]s, [[music]], [[document]]s, and for performing complex mathematical computations or for communication, commonly over a worldwide [[computer network]] called the [[internet]] which connects many of the world's computers.  All these activities made possible by digital electronic computers could, in essence, be performed with non-digital or non-electronic computers if they were sufficiently powerful, but it was only the combination of electronics technology with digital computation in binary that enabled humanity to reach the computation power necessary for today's computing. Advances in [[quantum computing]], [[DNA computing]], [[optical computing]] or other technologies could lead to the development of more powerful computers in the future.

Digital computers are inherently best described by [[discrete mathematics]], while analog computers are most commonly associated with [[continuous mathematics]].

The philosophy of [[digital physics]] views the [[universe]] as being digital. [[Konrad Zuse]] wrote a book known as ''[[Rechnender Raum]]'' in which he described the whole universe as one all-encompassing computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">The use of computers (including devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[laptop]]s) by children and adolescents before bed has been associated with a reduction in the hours of [[sleep]] experienced by frequent users, along with a decreased quality of sleep, in most cases. The results of computer use at night have been linked with tiredness.

A 2010 review concluded that "the use of electronic media by children and adolescents does have a negative impact on their sleep, although the precise effects and mechanisms remain unclear", with the most consistent results associating excessive media use with shorter sleep duration and delayed bed times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain |first=Neralie |last2=Gradisar |first2=Michael |title=Electronic media use and sleep in school-aged children and adolescents: a review |journal=Sleep Medicine |date=15 February 2010 |volume=11 |pages=735–742 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 meta-analysis found that "Bedtime access and use of media devices was significantly associated with inadequate sleep quantity; poor sleep quality; and excessive daytime sleepiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Ben|last2=Rees|first2=Philippa|last3=Hale|first3=Lauren|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Darsharna|last5=Paradkar|first5=Mandar S.|title=Association Between Portable Screen-Based Media Device Access or Use and Sleep Outcomes|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=1 December 2016|volume=170|issue=12|pages=1202|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2341|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60839202/poi160064.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends screen time for children be limited for multiple reasons, among them that "Too much screen time can also harm the amount and quality of sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy of Pediatrics Announces New Recommendations for Children’s Media Use|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-new-recommendations-for-childrens-media-use.aspx|website=www.aap.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many apps promise to improve sleep by filtering out blue light produced by media devices; there have been no large studies to assess whether such apps work.

'''Engineering''' is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to the [[innovation]], [[design]], [[construction]], operation and [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] of [[structure]]s, [[machine]]s, [[material]]s, devices, [[system]]s, [[process]]es, and [[organization]]s for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of [[applied mathematics]], [[applied science]], and types of application. See [[glossary of engineering]].

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAENG|url=http://www.iaeng.org/about_IAENG.html|website=iaeng.org|publisher=International Association of Engineers|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390 when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuacán]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]–[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

[[Ancient Greece]] developed machines in both civilian and military domains.

Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

===Renaissance era===
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinso|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815-1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969 |publisher =|location=

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomn steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who  built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Rhys | authorlink = | title = Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times| publisher = Ayer Publishing| year = 1936 | location =| page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-8369-2167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron merchant [[Thomas Newcomen]], who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.  With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges.  This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material]]

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the  first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of "engineer" for the first time with a count of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-504605-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875.  In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, [[mining]], mechanical and electrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907.  Germany established technical universities earlier.&lt;ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

===Chemical engineering===
{{Main|Chemical engineering}}
[[Chemical engineering]] is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of [[commodity chemicals]], [[specialty chemicals]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].

===Civil engineering===
{{Main|Civil engineering}}
[[Civil engineering]] is the design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] ([[airports]], [[roads]], [[railways]], water supply, and treatment etc.), [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including [[structural engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[surveying]]. It is traditionally considered to be separate from [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|url =https://www.britannica.com/technology/civil-engineering|title = Civil Engineering|last = Watson|first = J. Garth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[Electrical engineering]] is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
[[Mechanical engineering]] is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], and [[mechatronics]].

===Other branches===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Beyond these "Big 4", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.&lt;ref name="Discussion of The Method"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;

The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Canada, many engineers wear the [[Iron Ring]] as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE foreign parts"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;[http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ University of Texas at Dallas:  The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [[NASA]]'s aerospace design.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/nasa/overview.html Aerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Maillart]]'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.&lt;ref name="Princeton U"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/137.html Princeton U: Robert Maillart's Bridges: The Art of Engineering: quote: no doubt that Maillart was fully conscious of the aesthetic implications&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of South Florida]], an engineering professor, through a grant with the [[National Science Foundation]], has developed a course that connects art and engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chief engineer"&gt;[http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm quote:..the tools of artists and the perspective of engineers..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180822/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.

An '''exhaust gas temperature gauge''' (EGT gauge) is a [[Measuring instrument|meter]] used to monitor the [[exhaust gas temperature]] of an [[internal combustion engine]] in conjunction with a [[thermocouple]]-type [[pyrometer]].  EGT gauges are found in certain cars and aeroplanes. By monitoring EGT, the driver or pilot can get an idea of the vehicle's [[air-fuel ratio]].

At a [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] air-fuel ratio, the exhaust gas temperature is different from that in a lean or rich air-fuel ratio. At rich air-fuel ratio, the exhaust gas temperature either increases or decreases depending on the fuel. High temperatures (typically above {{convert|1600|F|C|disp=or|sigfig=1}}) can be an indicator of dangerous conditions that can lead to catastrophic engine failure.

==Applications==
*EGT meters are used for tuning [[turbo]]-equipped cars. If the sensor is installed at the manifold collector before the turbo, the turbine inlet temperature can be monitored. If the sensor is installed after the turbo, the exhaust temperature can be monitored. Because EGT typically drops {{convert|200|-|300|F-change}} across the turbine, installers try to put the thermocouple as close to the [[cylinder head]] as possible to give a true reading, and a reading that will react faster to the engine's condition compared to an installation after the turbo.
* [[Air-cooled engine]]s, like used in [[Volkswagen]], [[Porsche]] and other cars can be damaged by [[Internal_combustion_engine_cooling#Air-cooling|over heating]]. An exhaust gas temperature gauge can be used to prevent damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uh.edu/engines/epi2558.htm|title=No. 2558: Cooled by Air or Water|author=|date=|website=uh.edu|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809234658/http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2558.htm|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air-cooled [[motorcycle]] engines also can  be damaged by over heating.

==Oxygen sensor==
Using an EGT meter alone is considered an older technique for getting the most out of petrol and diesel engines, as a gauge-type wideband digital [[oxygen sensor]] can be purchased for about the same price, or for a little more. However, some advanced racers will use EGT gauges in combination with a wideband oxygen sensor to 'lean' the fuel ratio a bit to safely raise the temperature for more power.

==Advanced tuning==
Though by tuning primarily by EGT and [[air fuel ratio]] values, EGT is still to this day a used data output for engine tuning. When fine tuning an engine, if possible with the ECU manipulation with the cylinder's timing can be made. By adjusting the timing, the resultant cylinder temperature can be used to improve cylinder efficiency. Though this is still widely done, EGT values should be used as a safe guard sensor measure and as a tuning guide. [1]

In [[structural engineering]] and [[material science]], '''fast fracture''' is a term given to a phenomenon in which a [[wiktionary:flaw|flaw]] (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to [[catastrophic failure]] of the material. [[Stress (physics)|Stress]] acting on a material when fast fracture occurs is less than the material's [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]]. A very representative example of this is what happens when poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon's material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20435">[[Materials science]] has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of mankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Flint axe, about 31 cm long.]]

In many cases different cultures leave their materials as the only records which [[anthropologists]] can use to define the existence of such cultures.  The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. [[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.

In the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Ac.pantheon1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].]]

[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]]. Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built; a volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] containing [[crystal]]line material will produce material which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. That is one of the reasons that the [[concrete]] [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] of [[Rome]] could last for 1850 years, and  why the [[thatch]]ed [[farmhouse]]s of [[Holland]] sketched by [[Rembrandt]] have long since decayed.

After the [[thigh]][[bone]] [[dagger]]s of the early [[hunter-gatherer]]s were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [[medieval]] goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [[duke]]s and [[pope]]s. ''[[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini]]'' contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

==Stone Age==

The use of materials begins in the stone age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called Oldowan. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearing the end of the stone age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and pored into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolthic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China.  These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260 to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=He|title=Chinese ceramics : the new standard guide|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-23727-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[porcelain]] was invented in [[Tang Dynasty]] China. Porcelain in china resulted in a methodical development of widely used kilns that increased the quality and quantity that procelain could be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/porcelain-tang-618%E2%80%93906-and-song-960%E2%80%931279-dynasties|title=Porcelain in the Tang (618–906) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing]] of ceramics is invented by [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic chemists]] and [[Islamic pottery|potters]] in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=Robert B. |title=New Looks at Old Pots: Results of Recent Multidisciplinary Studies of Glazed Ceramics from the Islamic World |journal=Muqarnas: Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture |year=1995 |volume=XII |isbn=978-9004103146 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]] were invented in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; and [[lustreware]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 86–87, ''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 11th century, [[Damascus steel]] is developed in the [[Middle East]]. In the 15th century, [[Johann Gutenberg]] develops [[type metal]] alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [[cristallo]], a clear soda-based glass.

==Early modern period==
In the 16th century, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] publishes his Pirotechnia, the first systematic book on [[metallurgy]], [[Georg Agricola]] writes De Re Metallica, an influential book on [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]], and glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] are developed in the [[Netherlands]] and used for the first time in [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

In the 17th century, [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' ([[strength of materials]] and [[kinematics]]) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. In the 18th century, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patents a process for the production of metallic [[zinc]] by [[distillation]] from [[calamine]] and charcoal, [[Bryan Higgins]] was issued a [[patent]] for hydraulic cement ([[stucco]]) for use as an exterior [[plaster]], and [[Alessandro Volta]] makes a copper/zinc [[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] invents the [[thermocouple]], Joseph Aspin invents [[Portland cement]], [[Charles Goodyear]] invents [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] invent [[silver]]-based [[photography|photographic]] processes, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrates color photography, and [[Charles Fritts]] makes the first [[solar cell]]s using [[selenium]] waffles.

Before the early 1800s, [[aluminum]] had not been produced as an isolated metal.  It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-Héroult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.  The [[Bayer process]] and the [[Hall-Héroult process]] are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayer's Process for Alumina Production: A Historical Production|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num17-18/num17-18%20p15-19.pdf|website=scs.illinois.edu|publisher=Fathi Habashi, Laval University|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material Science as a Field of Study==
Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Bernedetta|title=Materials science and engineering: an artificial discipline about to explode|website=History of Recent Materials Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Gregory|title=A Materials Science Timeline|website=Materials World Modules}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. The Department of defense signed a contract with 5 universities (Harvard, MIT, Brown, Stanford, and Chicago) providing over $13 million for material research. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in 1960's.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Modern materials science==

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [[metallurgy]] and perhaps of [[ceramic]]s as well.  Much effort was expended on consideration of the [[austenite]]-[[martensite]]-[[cementite]] phases found in the iron-carbon [[phase diagram]] that underlies [[steel]] production.  The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.  [[Northwestern University]] instituted the first materials science department in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/about/index.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E. Tressler lecture in Materials Science] from [[Penn State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Society (MRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org Materials Research Society]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field.  MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.
Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] created the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DoD Directive Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/dod-establishes-arpa|website=www.darpa.mil|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.

The '''iControlPad''' is a [[wireless]] [[game controller]] compatible with a variety of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], and [[personal computer]]s. It is designed for use as either a standalone [[gamepad]] or attached to appropriately sized devices, such as the [[iPhone]], using a clamp system.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetoid.com/2011/07/09/icontrolpad-review/|title=iControlPad Review|publisher=Gadgetoid|date=July 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the iControlPad is able to add traditional physical gaming controls to devices which otherwise rely on inputs such as [[touchscreen]]s and [[accelerometer]]s.&lt;ref name="MobileMagReal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobilemag.com/2008/12/23/game-for-real-with-iphone-icontrolpad/ | title = Game for Real with iPhone iControlPad | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Kwan | first = Michael | date = 2008-12-23 | work = [[Mobile Magazine]] | publisher = Pilato Private Consulting | quote = Naturally, you’ll still be able to take advantage of anything on the touchscreen [...] using the accelerometer, but having “real” gaming controls is a great option as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The iControlPad's input controls include an eight-directional [[D-pad]], dual [[analog stick|analog nubs]], six digital face buttons, and two digital trigger buttons on the gamepad's reverse. The sides of the iControlPad are detachable, with two different attachment types: rubber grips, for using the controller as a standard wireless gamepad; or plastic clamps, for connecting with a suitable handheld, such as a smartphone or [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; A [[mini USB]] port on the bottom of the iControlPad can be used to charge the internal 1500mAh battery, update the device's [[firmware]], and charge attached devices using a [[USB On-The-Go]] connection and an appropriate adapter.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt;

The iControlPad, a [[Bluetooth]] device, can be run in a wide variety of modes, including as a [[Human interface device|HID]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[joystick]], and gamepad, among others, allowing compatibility with equipment which is limited to only certain types of input.&lt;ref name="iCPManual" /&gt; One of the iControlPad's modes mimics the protocol used by the [[iCade]], an [[Video game arcade cabinet|arcade cabinet]] released for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]], facilitating compatibility between apps designed for the iCade and the iControlPad hardware.&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

Due to the iControlPad's ability to operate as a Bluetooth keyboard&amp;mdash;by mapping the D-pad and buttons to standard keyboard keys&amp;mdash;it is able to communicate with devices such as those running Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], including the iPhone and iPad, which do not support Bluetooth gamepads.&lt;ref name="148Physical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/news/gaming-ios-physical-variety-external-joystick-gamepad-solutions/|title=Gaming on iOS is About to Get Physical With a Variety of External Joystick and Gamepad Solutions.|publisher=148Apps|first=Carter|last=Dotson|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since iOS natively supports keyboards, apps can be developed with iControlPad compatibility using either its own protocol or that of the iCade. Thus, the iControlPad is able to control [[video games]] and [[video game console emulator]]s across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="DroidReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/game-news/hardware-a-devices/1493-icontrolpad-for-android-review-its-as-easy-as-a-b-x-y-|title=iControlPad for Android Review: It's as easy as A, B, X, Y...|publisher=DroidGamers|first=Tom|last=Grace|date=April 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Development of the iControlPad began in 2007,{{Specify|date=July 2011}} with testing using a hacked [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] gamepad to connect to an iPhone over the [[Dock Connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|dock connection]].&lt;ref name="iCPArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316081844/http://www.icontrolpad.com/|archivedate=March 16, 2009|title=iControlPad - Add real gaming controls to your iPhone!|publisher=iControlPad Ltd|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the serial connection was working, the first prototype iControlPad was produced, using a design styled after the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]. This earliest concept was a one-piece case enveloping the iPhone, with a [[D-pad]] on the left side, and four face buttons on the right in a landscape orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/23/icontrolpad-gamepad-heads-to-production-warms-hearts/ | title = iControlPad gamepad heads to production, warms hearts | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Stevens | first = Tim | date = December 12, 2008 | work = [[Engadget]] | publisher = [[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first revealed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/icontrolpad-unofficial-iphone-gamepad-coming-soon-50000514/ | title = iControlPad unofficial iPhone gamepad coming soon | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Wattanajantra | first = Asavin | date = 2010-08-27 | publisher = [[CNET]] | quote = The device has been in development for some time. [...] A different form of the iControlPad appeared before in 2008 [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='gadgetlab 2011-02-09'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/02/icontrolpad-for-iphone-finally-shipping-adds-support-for-all-phones/ | title = iControlPad for iPhone Finally Shipping, Adds Support for All Phones | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Sorrel | first = Charlie | date = 2011-02-09 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | quote = At long, long last the iControlPad – a hardware gamepad for the iPhone – can be bought. Well, almost. You can order today for a delivery next week [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2009, a completely redesigned iControlPad prototype was under development. This much larger version moved the controls below the screen and added two analog nubs and two trigger buttons to the controller.&lt;ref name="EngadgetProto09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/08/latest-icontrolpad-prototype-bulks-up-gets-handled-on-video/|title=Latest iControlPad prototype bulks up, gets handled on video|publisher=[[Engadget]]|first=Nilay|last=Patel|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design, which featured clamps to attach it to the iPhone, was much closer to the version that was ultimately released, and would soon go into production.&lt;ref name="SlashProduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-for-iphone-production-parts-now-shipping-2398553/|title=iControlPad for iPhone production parts now shipping|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one large change was made very late in development. The team had secretly added Bluetooth support to the iControlPad, in order to increase compatibility beyond the iPhone and its proprietary connection.&lt;ref name="TwitterSecret"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Craigix/statuses/25788017664|title=Something we kept secret ...|publisher=[[Twitter]]|first=Craig|last=Rothwell|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved fortunate when Apple began exercising its rights over the dock connector, suing an unlicensed accessory maker. Thus, the iControlPad team were forced to adapt to use the Bluetooth connection for the iPhone,&lt;ref name="SlashDock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-dumps-dock-connector-for-bluetooth-over-apple-legal-fears-android-bt-confirmed-28104830/|title=iControlPad dumps Dock Connector for Bluetooth over Apple legal fears; Android BT confirmed|publisher=[[SlashGear]]|first=Chris|last=Davies|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was this version which finally became available for order in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slashgear.com/icontrolpad-with-bluetooth-shipping-this-month-08131711/ | title = iControlPad with Bluetooth Shipping This Month | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | last = Perkins | first = Samia | date = February 8, 2011 | work = [[SlashGear]] | publisher = R3 Media LLC | quote = The new iControlPad with Bluetooth is scheduled to ship February 16th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reception for the iControlPad has been mostly positive. [[The Register|Register Hardware]] noted that while "patience and geekery" were required to get the controller working, the iControlPad "almost perfectly solves the touchscreen game control conundrum".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.com/2011/05/18/review_igamer_icontrolpad/|title=iControlPad Bluetooth controller for mobile devices|publisher=[[The Register|Register Hardware]]|first=Andrew|last=Bailey|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadgetoid homed in on the device's usefulness for classic gaming, remarking that it was "awesome [...] for emulation on the go".&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt; TouchArcade's reviewer said while playing games with the iControlPad that "the experience feels great", but that "[he couldn't] recommend that the typical gamer run out right now and grab one," due to its limited support on the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref name="TouchReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/07/13/a-close-look-at-the-icontrolpad-bluetooth-control-accessory/|title=A Close Look at the 'iControlPad' Bluetooth Control Accessory|publisher=TouchArcade|first=Blake|last=Patterson|date=July 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reviews were mixed on the quality of the controls, with DroidGamers describing them as "very loose",&lt;ref name="DroidReview" /&gt; while, conversely, Register Hardware said "the analogue nubs and face buttons work extremely well".&lt;ref name="RegisterReview" /&gt; The controller's responsiveness was later improved by replacing the original rubber keymat with a larger one. In their review, Gadgetoid lauded the inputs as having "a great tactile feel and a liberal amount of travel with a good response."&lt;ref name="GadgetoidReview" /&gt;

==iControlPad 2==

A successor, the '''iControlPad 2''', was successfully funded via [[Kickstarter]] in October 2012. As of November 2013, it has been cancelled,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with little to no refunds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16446">The '''ISO 15926''' is a standard for [[data integration]], sharing, exchange, and hand-over between [[computer system]]s.

The title, "''Industrial automation systems and integration&amp;mdash;Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities''",  is regarded too narrow by the present ISO 15926 developers. Having developed a [[generic data model]] and Reference Data Library for process plants, it turned out that this subject is already so wide, that actually any state information may be modelled with it.

== History ==
In 1991 a European Union [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]]-, named ProcessBase, started. The focus of this research project was to develop a [[data model]] for lifecycle information of a facility that would suit the requirements of the process industries. At the time that the project duration had elapsed, a consortium of companies involved in the process industries had been established: [[EPISTLE]] (European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive). Initially individual companies were members, but later this changed into a situation where three national consortia were the only members: PISTEP (UK), POSC/Caesar (Norway), and USPI-NL (Netherlands). (later PISTEP merged into POSC/Caesar, and USPI-NL was renamed to USPI).

EPISTLE took over the work of the ProcessBase project. Initially this work involved a standard called ISO 10303-221 (referred to as "[[ISO 10303|STEP]] AP221"). In that AP221 we saw, for the first time, an Annex M with a list of standard instances of the AP221 data model, including types of objects. These standard instances would be for reference and would act as a knowledge base with knowledge about the types of objects.
In the early nineties EPISTLE started an activity to extend Annex M to become a library of such object classes and their relationships: STEPlib. In the STEPlib activities a group of approx. 100 domain experts from all three member consortia, spread over the various expertises (e.g. Electrical, Piping, Rotating equipment, etc.), worked together to define the "core classes".

The development of STEPlib was extended with many additional classes and relationships between classes and published as [[Open Source]] data. Furthermore, the concepts and relation types from the AP221 and ISO 15926-2 data models were also added to the STEPlib dictionary. This resulted in the development of [[Gellish English]], whereas STEPlib became the [[Gellish English dictionary]]. Gellish English is a structured subset of natural English and is a [[modeling language]] suitable for [[knowledge modeling]], [[product modeling]] and [[data exchange]]. It differs from conventional modeling languages ([[meta language]]s) as used in information technology as it not only defines generic concepts, but also includes an English dictionary. The semantic expression capability of Gellish English was significantly increased by extending the number of relation types that can be used to express knowledge and information.

For modelling-technical reasons POSC/Caesar proposed another standard than [[ISO 10303]], called ISO 15926. EPISTLE (and ISO) supported that proposal, and continued the modelling work, thereby writing Part 2 of ISO 15926. This Part 2 has official ISO IS (International Standard) status since 2003.

POSC/Caesar started to put together their own RDL (Reference Data Library). They added many specialized classes, for example for [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute) pipe and pipe fittings. Meanwhile, STEPlib continued its existence, mainly driven by some members of USPI. Since it was clear that it was not in the interest of the industry to have two libraries for, in essence, the same set of classes, the Management Board of EPISTLE decided that the core classes of the two libraries shall be merged into Part 4 of ISO 15926. This merging process has been finished. Part 4 should act as reference data for part 2 of ISO 15926 as well as for ISO 10303-221 and replaced its Annex M. On June 5, 2007 ISO 15926-4 was signed off as a TS (Technical Specification).

In 1999 the work on an earlier version of Part 7 started. Initially this was based on [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] (the only useful W3C Recommendation available then), but when [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] became available it was clear that provided a far more suitable environment for Part 7. Part 7 passed the first ISO ballot by the end of 2005, and an implementation project started. A formal ballot for TS (Technical Specification) was planned for December 2007. However, it was decided then to split Part 7 into more than one part, because the scope was too wide.

== The standard ==
{{External links|date=May 2012}}
ISO 15926 has eleven parts (as of June 2009):

* Part 1 [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29556] - Introduction, information concerning engineering, construction and operation of production facilities is created, used and modified by many different organizations throughout a facility's lifetime. The purpose of ISO 15926 is to facilitate integration of data to support the lifecycle activities and processes of production facilities.
* Part 2 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111019195316/http://www.stanford.edu/group/narratives/classes/08-09/CEE215/ReferenceLibrary/FIATECH%20ISO%2015926/ISO/pack/ISO%2015926%20part2%20pack/ECM4.5/lifecycle_integration_schema.html]- Data Model. a generic 4D model that can support all disciplines, supply chain company types and life cycle stages, regarding information about functional requirements, physical solutions, types of objects and individual objects as well as activities.
* Part 3 - Reference data for geometry and topology.
* Parts 4 [http://data.posccaesar.org/rdl/] - Reference Data, the terms used within facilities for the process industry.
* Part 7 [http://www.15926.org] - Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities - Part 7: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: Template methodology.
* Part 8 [http://www.15926.org] - Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities - Part 8: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL/RDF) implementation.
* Part 9 (in development)- Implementation standards, with the focus on Façades, standard web servers, web services, and security.
* Part 10 (in development)- Test Methods.
* Part 11 (in development)- Industrial Usage Guidelines.
* Part 12 (in development)- Life cycle integration ontology in [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL2).
* Part 13 (in development)- Integrated lifecycle asset planning.

=== Description ===
The model and the library are suitable for representing lifecycle information about technical installations and their components.

They can also be used for defining the terms used in product catalogs in [[e-commerce]]. Another, more limited, use of the standard is as a reference classification for harmonization purposes between shared databases and product catalogues that are not based on ISO 15926.

The purpose of ISO 15926 is to provide a [[Lingua franca|Lingua Franca]] for computer systems, thereby integrating the information produced by them. Although set up for the process industries with large projects involving many parties, and involving plant operations and maintenance lasting decades, the technology can be used by anyone willing to set up a proper vocabulary of reference data in line with Part 4.

In Part 7 the concept of Templates is introduced. These are semantic constructs, using Part 2 entities, that represent a small piece of information. These constructs then are mapped to more efficient classes of n-ary relations that interlink the Nodes that are involved in the represented information.

In Part 8 the data model of Part 2 is mapped to OWL, and so are, in concept, the Reference Data of Part 4 and the templates of Part 7. For validation and reasoning purposes all are represented in First-Order Logic as well.

In Part 9 these Node and Template instances are stored in Façades. A Façade is an RDF [[quad store]], set up to a standard schema and an API. Any Façade only stores the data for which the Façade owner is responsible.

Each participating computer system maps its data from its internal format to such ISO-standard Node and Template instances. These are stored in a System Façade, each system its own Façade.

Data can be "handed over" from one Façade to another in cases where data custodianship is handed over (e.g. from a contractor to a plant owner, or from a manufacturer to the owners of the manufactured goods). Hand-over can be for a part of all data, whilst maintaining full referential integrity.

Façades can be set up for the consolidation of data by handing over data produced by various participating computer systems and stored in their System Façades. Examples are: a Façade for a project discipline, a project, a plant).

Documents are user-definable. They are defined in [[XML Schema]] and they are, in essence, only a structure containing cells that make reference to instances of Templates. This represents a view on all lifecycle data: since the data model is a 4D (space-time) model, it is possible to present the data that was valid at any given point in time, thus providing a true historical record. It is expected that this will be used for Knowledge Mining.

Data can be queried by means of [[SPARQL]]. In any implementation a restricted number of Façades can be involved, with different access rights. This is done by means of creating a CPF Server (= Confederation of Participating Façades). An [[Ontology (computer science)|Ontology]] Browser allows for access to one or more Façades in a given CPF, depending on the access rights.

== Projects and applications ==
{{External links|date=May 2012}}
There are a number of projects working on the extension of the ISO 15926 standard in different application areas.

=== Capital-intensive projects ===

Within the application of Capital Intensive projects, some cooperating implementation projects are running:

* The DEXPI project: The objective of DEXPI is to develop and promote a general standard for the process industry covering all phases of the lifecycle of a (petro-)chemical plant, ranging from specification of functional requirements to assets in operation. See more at [http://www.dexpi.org dexpi.org]

Finalised projects include:

* The EDRC Project of [http://www.fiatech.org FIATECH] [http://www.fiatech.org/images/stories/projects/Project_Resumes/EDRC_Resume_v8_Sept_13_2013.pdf Capturing Equipment Data Requirements Using ISO 15926 and Assessing Conformance]. [http://techinvestlab.ru/EDRCDemo Example data and videos.]
* The ADI Project of [http://www.fiatech.org FIATECH], to build the tools (which will then be made available in the public domain)
** The tools and deliverables can be seen on the ISO 15926 knowledge base: [http://15926.org]
* The IDS Project of [http://www.posccaesar.org POSC Caesar Association], to define product models required for data sheets
* A joint ADI-IDS project is the [[ISO 15926 WIP]]

=== Upstream Oil and Gas industry ===

The [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]] (OLF) has decided to use ISO 15926 (also known as the [[Oil and Gas Ontology]]) as the instrument for integrating data across disciplines and business domains for the [[Upstream (oil industry)|Upstream Oil and Gas industry]]. It is seen as one of the enablers of what has been called the next (or second) generation of [[Integrated operations]], where a better integration across companies is the goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olf.no/getfile.php/zKonvertert/www.olf.no/Rapporter/Dokumenter/070919%20IO%20and%20Ontology%20-%20Brosjyre.pdf |title=Integrated Operations and the Oil and Gas Ontology |author=The Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) |accessdate=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following projects are currently running (May 2009):

* The [[Integrated Operations in the High North|Integrated Operations in the High North (IOHN)]] project is working on extending ISO 15926 to handle real-time data transmission and (pre-)processing to enable the next generation of [[Integrated operations|Integrated Operations]].
* The [http://trac.posccaesar.org/wiki/EW Environment Web] project to include environmental reporting terms and definitions  as used in [http://www.epim.no EPIM]'s [http://www.epim.no/default.asp?id=945 EnvironmentWeb] in ISO 15926.

Finalised projects include:

* The [http://trac.posccaesar.org/wiki/IIP Integrated Information Platform (IIP)] project working on establishing a real-time information pipeline based on open standards. It worked among others on:
** [http://www.posccaesar.org/wiki/NcsDdr Daily Drilling Report (DDR)] to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard became mandatory on February 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |title=Drilling Reporting to the authorities |author=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate |accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for reporting on the [[Norwegian Continental Shelf]] by the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)]] and [http://www.ptil.no/main-page/category9.html Safety Authority Norway (PSA)]. NPD says that the quality of the reports has improved considerably since.
** [http://www.posccaesar.org/wiki/NcsDpr Daily Production Report (DPR)] to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard was tested successfully on the [[Valhall oil field|Valhall]] ([[BP]]-operated) and [http://www.statoilhydro.com/en/ouroperations/explorationprod/ncs/aasgard/pages/default.aspx Åsgard] ([[StatoilHydro]]-operated) fields offshore Norway. The terminology and XML schemata developed have also been included in [http://www.Energistics.org Energistics]’ [[PRODML]] standard.

== Some technical background ==
One of the main requirements was (and still is) that the scope of the data model covers the entire lifecycle of a facility (e.g. oil refinery) and its components (e.g. pipes, pumps and their parts, etc.). Since such a facility over such a long time entails many different types of activities on a myriad of different objects it became clear that a generic and data-driven data model would be required.

A simple example will illustrate this. There are thousands of different types of physical objects in a facility (pumps, compressors, pipes, instruments, fluids, etc). Each of these has many properties. If all combinations would be modelled in a "hard-coded" fashion, the number of combinations would be staggering, and unmanageable.

The solution is a "template" that represents the semantics of: "This object has a property of  X yyyy" (where yyyy is the unit of measure). Any instance of that template refers to the applicable reference data:
* physical object (e.g. my Induction Motor)
* indirect property type (e.g. the class "cold locked rotor time")
* base property type (here: time)
* scale (here: seconds)

Without being able to make reference to those classes, via the Internet, it will be impossible to express this information.

{{InfoMaps}}
'''Information mapping''' is a research-based method for writing clear and user focused information, based on the audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method is applied primarily to designing and developing business and technical communications. It is used as a content standard within organizations throughout the world.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

== Overview of the information mapping method ==
The information mapping method is a research-based methodology used to analyze, organize and present information based on an audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method applies to all subject matter and media technology. Information mapping has close ties to [[information visualization]], [[information architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[information design]], [[data analysis]], [[experience design]], graphic [[user interface design]], and [[knowledge management]] systems.

== Components of the method ==
Information mapping provides a number of tools for analyzing, organizing and presenting information.

=== Information types ===
Some of [[Robert E. Horn]]'s best-known work was his development of the theory of information types. Horn identified six types of information that account for nearly all the content of business and technical communications. The types categorize elements according to their purpose for the audience:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"!
!Information Type
!Description
|-
|'''Procedure'''
|A set of steps an individual performs to complete a single task
|-
|'''Process'''
|A series of events, stages or phases that occurs over time and has a specific outcome
|-
|'''Principle'''
|A statement designed to dictate, guide or require behavior
|-
|'''Concept'''
|A class or group of things that share a critical set of attributes
|-
|'''Structure'''
|A description or depiction of anything that has parts or boundaries
|-
|'''Fact'''
|A statement that is assumed to be true
|}

=== Research-based principles ===
The information mapping method proposes six principles for organizing information so that it is easy to access, understand, and remember:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"
!Principle
!Description
|-
|'''Chunking'''
|Break up information into small, manageable units
|-
|'''Relevance'''
|Limit each unit of information to a single topic
|-
|'''Labeling'''
|Label each unit of information in a way that identifies its contents
|-
|'''Consistency'''
|Be consistent in use of terminology as well as in organizing, formatting and sequencing information
|-
|'''Accessible detail'''
|Organize and structure information so those who need detail can access it easily, while those who don't can easily skip it
|-
|'''Integrated graphics'''
|Use graphics within the text to clarify, emphasize and add dimension
|}

=== Units of information ===
Documents written according to information mapping have a modular structure. They consist of clearly outlined information units (''maps'' and ''blocks'') that take into account how much information a reader is able to assimilate.

There is an essential difference between an information unit and the traditional text paragraph. A ''block'' is limited to a single topic and consists of a single type of information. Blocks are grouped into ''maps'', and each map consists only of relevant blocks. The hierarchical approach to structuring information greatly facilitates electronic control of content via [[content management system]]s and knowledge management systems.

== Advantages of information mapping ==
The information mapping method offers advantages to writers and readers, as well as to an entire organization.

=== Advantages for writers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for writers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* An easily learned systematic approach to the task of writing that once learned, enables writers to minimize down time and start writing immediately
* A subject-matter independent approach that can be applied to all business-related or technical content
* A content standard that greatly facilitates team writing and management of writing projects
* Enhanced writer productivity, with less time required for both draft development and review, and
* Easy updating and revision of content throughout its life cycle

=== Advantages for readers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for readers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Quick, easy access to information at the right level of detail, even for diverse audiences
* Improved comprehension
* Fewer errors and misunderstandings
* Fewer questions for supervisors, and
* Shorter training cycles, less need for re-training

=== Advantages for organizations ===
Also an entire organization can benefit from using a content standard like information mapping if the method is used with the following objectives in mind:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Revenue growth by reducing time to create content and accelerating time to market
* Cost reduction by capturing employee knowledge, increasing operational efficiency, reducing support calls, and decreasing translation costs
* Risk mitigation by increasing safety and compliance

== History ==
Information mapping was developed in the late 20th century by [[Robert E. Horn]], a researcher in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. Horn was interested in visual presentation of information to improve accessibility, comprehension and performance. Horn's development of the information mapping method has won him recognition from the [[International Society for Performance Improvement]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

=== Review of research ===
Many independent studies have confirmed that applying the information mapping method to business and technical communications results in quicker, easier access to information, improved comprehension and enhanced performance. It also facilitates repurposing for publication in different formats.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Doubts have been raised over the strength of the research Horn uses to justify some of his principles. For instance, his chunking principle requires lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections in a document to contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Horn, ''Developing Procedures, Policies &amp; Documentation'', Info-Map, Waltham, 1992, page 3-A-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn does not state where he got this principle, but an Information Mapping website stated that the principle is "based on George A. Miller's 1956 research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/themethod/Mapping_FAQs |title=Mapping FAQs |work=Infomap.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218043241/http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/TheMethod/Mapping_FAQs |archivedate=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller did write a paper in 1956 called "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information", but its relevance to writing is tenuous.&lt;ref name="Marnell"&gt;Geofrey Marnell, ''Essays on Technical Writing'', Burdock Books, Brighton, 2016, pp. 111–155).&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself said that his research had nothing to do with writing.&lt;ref&gt;See http://members.shaw.ca/philip.sharman/miller.txt, Viewed 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Insisting that lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections throughout  a document contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information paradoxically assumes that the size of what is not read in a document can influence a reader's ability to comprehend what they do read.&lt;ref name="Marnell"/&gt;

== Conferences &amp; Expo ==
[[File:ISTE Startup Pavillion.jpg|left|alt=ISTE Startup Pavilion|thumb|Picture of the Startup Pavilion at the ISTE Conference]]
ISTE is probably best known for its annual conference (called the ISTE Conference &amp; Expo). The annual conference serves as a forum for exploring and exchanging ideas about education technology with educators from around the world. The event attracts more than 24,000 educators and education leaders, and includes keynote speakers, hundreds of sessions, and a massive expo where vendors can show off the latest ed tech products and services. Recent conferences have been held in Chicago, IL (2018), San Antonio, TX (2017), Denver, CO (2016) Philadelphia, PA (2015) and Atlanta, GA (2014).

The 2019 conference will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 23–26, 2019.  See [https://conference.iste.org/2019/ ISTE Conference 2019] for more information.

== Educational Technology Standards ==
The [[ISTE Standards]] (formerly "[[National Educational Technology Standards]]", NETS) are a framework for implementing digital strategies in education to positively impact learning, teaching and leading. Along with the standards themselves, ISTE offers information and resources to support understanding and implementation of the standards at a variety of levels.  See [https://www.iste.org/standards ISTE Standards].

== ISTE Advocacy ==
ISTE actively advocates for education technology at the local and national levels to advance the global transformation of education through the application of technology to education. We work with educators and policy makers at all levels to try to ensure that all learners have equal access to tools, connectivity and skills needed for success in using technology. See [https://www.iste.org/advocacy ISTE Advocacy].

== Membership ==
ISTE membership is extended to individuals, affiliates (organizations, like school districts and state technology organizations), and corporate members interested in the use and application of technology in Education.

=== Corporate Members ===
In addition to an individual membership of over 20,000, ISTE has several corporate members, including:

Adobe, Apple, Best Buy, BrainPOP, Canon U.S.A., CDW-G, Cisco Systems, Dell, Google, LEGO Education, Microsoft, Pearson, PowerSchool, SMART Technologies, Summit Learning, the Verizon Foundation, and more

.

== History ==

The International Council for Computers in Education (ICCE) was founded in 1979, with [[David Moursund]] as executive officer and editor-in-chief of the organization's organ ''The Computing Teacher''.&lt;ref name="Johnstone2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Johnstone|title=Never Mind the Laptops: Kids, Computers, and the Transformation of Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsWRDjcuao8C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2003|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-28842-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 ICCE changed its name to the present name, International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). Shortly after, in 1990, The ''Computing Teacher'' was retitled ''Learning and Leading with Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Today's Education: The Journal of the National Education Association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10261">The '''knowledge divide''' is the gap in standards of living between those who can find, create, manage, process, and disseminate information or knowledge, and those who are impaired in this process. According to a 2005 UNESCO World Report, the rise in the 21st century of a global information society has resulted in the emergence of knowledge as a valuable resource, increasingly determining who has access to power and profit.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report: Toward Knowledge Societies (Paris: UNESCO, 2005), 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid dissemination of information on a potentially global scale as a result of new information media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and the globally uneven ability to assimilate knowledge and information has resulted in potentially expanding gaps in knowledge between individuals and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "Knowledge as a Global Public Good," in Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century, ed. I. Kahl et al. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In the 21st century, the emergence of the [[knowledge society]] becomes pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]] World Report (2005) Towards Knowledge Societies; retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001418/141843e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of world's economy and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and communication technologies ([[Information technology|ICT]]) these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission (2002). Building the Knowledge Society - Report to Government, December 2002 retrieved from http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become essential for all societies.

==Between nations==

According to [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report: Knowledge for Development (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge gaps between nations may occur due to the varying degrees by which individual nations incorporate the following elements:

* ''Human rights and fundamental freedoms'': An absence of freedom within a society can diminish or delay the ability of its members to acquire, debate, and transmit knowledge.  Vital to the spread of knowledge and information between nations are such freedoms as [[freedom of expression]], an absence of censorship, free circulation of information, and [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Democracy]]''
* ''Plurality of knowledge and information'': This includes a diverse media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptance of diverse forms of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Quality infrastructure'': For instance, a poor electrical grid makes the existence of computer networks or of higher education institutions less attainable.
* ''Effective communication system'': This will affect the dissemination of knowledge or movement of ideas within and between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Effective education system'': Gaps in knowledge between nations can exist when individual countries invest too little in primary school education, which acts as the base for the entire education system.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[UNESCO]], in order for a nation to become a knowledge society, primary education must focus on basic literacy and must be universally accessible.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as others have pointed out, higher education may be equally important for closing knowledge gaps between nations, particularly between newly industrialized nations, such as the Republic of Korea, and more advanced industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the former, higher education can play an important role in bridging knowledge gaps, but must benefit more than a small elite portion of the population and must be taught at international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The poor development of educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people belonging to that society.
* ''Focus on Research and Innovation'': As the [[World Bank]] suggests, [[Research &amp; Development]] within a nation can enable it to follow current developments in global knowledge and also to understand how to adapt external knowledge and technology to meet its needs.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In nations with low degrees of R&amp;D, government funding can provide a significant portion of support that can later be taken over by private investment.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Closely tied to effective education systems is the need for a nation to allow for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because higher educational institutions are significant contributors to R&amp;D,&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; these institutions must be granted freedom to create and disseminate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  An environment supportive of research and innovation may also help stem the "[[brain drain]]" of educated individuals from knowledge-poor nations to knowledge-rich nations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Intellectual Property Rights'': Closely connected to a focus on research and innovation are national and international Intellectual Property Rights. Within a nation, Intellectual Property Rights can spawn research and innovation by providing economic incentives for investing in new knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as stated by the [[World Bank]], by protecting innovations, intellectual property rights may also inhibit knowledge-sharing and may prevent developing nations from benefitting from knowledge produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital divide==

The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very important. This is why digitization is viewed closely related to knowledge. Scientists generally agree that there is a [[digital divide]], recently different reports also showed the existence of knowledge divide.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission, 2002; UNESCO, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation and effective use of knowledge are increasingly related to the development of an ICT infrastructure. Without ICT, it is impossible to have an infrastructure able to process the huge flow of information required in an advanced economy. In particular, without adequate technical support, it is difficult to develop and use e-learning and electronic documents to overcome time and space constraints.

The digital divide is, however, but one important part of the larger knowledge divide.  As UNESCO states, "closing the digital divide will not suffice to close the knowledge divide, for access to useful, relevant knowledge is more than simply a matter of infrastructure—it depends on training, cognitive skills and regulatory frameworks geared towards access to contents."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

In the book Digital Dead End, Virginia Eubanks criticizes the way that the digital divide is generally thought of as a division between haves and have-nots, where the solution is distribution. This over simplistic depiction obscures the fact that often social and [[structural inequality]] is at the root of the divide. According to a study done by Eubanks with women of the YWCA, the women of the community "insisted that have-nots possess many different kinds of crucial information and skills." In other words, it is not simply knowledge of the technology itself that is the issue but the structural system based on perpetuating the status quo in which the haves "hoard" knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Eubanks, V. (2011). Digital dead end: fighting for social justice in the information age. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In gender, race, ethnicity and social class==

First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the [[North-South divide|North and the South]] {{Where|date=July 2011}} (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also on the development of education in these countries. If a country has attained a higher literacy level then this will result in having higher level of knowledge.
Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a knowledge divide with respect to
* Gender: Socio-cultural inequalities between men and women, such as unequal access to education and technology, create the conditions for unequal access to knowledge.  This can cause significant knowledge gaps both within and between nations, the latter resulting from individual nations' underutilization of their full knowledge workforce.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report 2005, 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race
* Ethnicity
* Social class

== LTE in Unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) ==
The first version of LTE-Unlicensed is called LTE-U and is developed by the LTE-U Forum to work with the existing 3GPP Releases 10/11/12. LTE-U was designed for quick launch in countries, such as the United States and China, that do not mandate implementing the listen-before-talk (LBT) technique. LTE-U would allow cellphone carriers to boost coverage in their cellular networks, by using the unlicensed 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band already [[802.11ac|populated]] by Wi-Fi devices. 

LTE-U is intended to let cell networks boost data speeds over short distances, without requiring the user to use a separate Wi-Fi network as they normally would. It differs from [[Generic Access Network|Wi-Fi calling]]; there remains a control channel using LTE, but all data (not just phone calls) flows over the unlicensed 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band, instead of the carrier's frequencies.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/verizon-and-t-mobile-join-forces-in-fight-for-wi-fi-airwaves/|title=LTE over Wi-Fi spectrum sets up industry-wide fight over interference|author=Jon Brodkin|date=27 August 2015|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the LTE-U Forum was created by [[Verizon]], in conjunction with [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Ericsson]], [[Qualcomm]], and [[Samsung]] as members.&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lteuforum.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=LTE-U Forum|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The forum collaborates and creates technical specifications for base stations and consumer devices passing LTE-U on the unlicensed 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band, as well as coexistence specs to handle traffic contention with existing Wi-Fi devices.

[[T-Mobile]] and [[Verizon Wireless]] have indicated early interest in deploying such a system as soon as 2016.&lt;ref name="LightRead"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/small-cells/t-mobile-expects-lte-u-to-feature-listen-before-talk/d/d-id/715544 |title=T-Mobile Expects LTE-U to Feature Listen-Before-Talk |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015 |publisher=LightReading |author=Sarah Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cell providers ordinarily rely on the [[radio spectrum]] to which they have exclusive licenses, LTE-U would share space with Wi-Fi equipment already inhabiting that band &amp;ndash; smartphones, laptops and tablets connecting to home broadband networks, free hotspots provided by businesses, and so on.

As of late 2018, all trial and commercial deployments of pre-standards LTE Forum LTE-U technology have been shut down or upgraded to the 3GPP Standard release 13 LTE-LAA.

== License Assisted Access (LAA) ==
The second variant of LTE-Unlicensed is Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) and has been standardized by the 3GPP in Rel-13. LAA adheres to the requirements of the LBT protocol, which is mandated in Europe and Japan. It promises to provide a unified global framework that complies with the regulatory requirements in the different regions of the world. 
* 3GPP Rel-13 defines LAA only for the downlink (DL). 
* 3GPP Rel-14 defines enhanced-Licensed Assisted Access (eLAA), which includes uplink (UL) operation in the unlicensed channel. 
* 3GPP Rel-15 The technology continued to be developed in 3GPP's release 15 under the title Further Enhanced LAA (feLAA). 

[[Ericsson]] uses the term '''License Assisted Access''' (LAA) to describe similar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telecoms.com/397492/ericsson-demonstrates-live-laa-for-verizon-sk-telecom-t-mobile-us/|title=Ericsson demonstrates live LAA for Verizon, SK Telecom, T-Mobile US|publisher=telecom.com|author=Auri Aittokallio|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LAA is the [[3rd Generation Partnership Project]]'s (3GPP) effort to standardize operation of LTE in the Wi-Fi bands.  It uses a [[contention-based protocol|contention protocol]] known as listen-before-talk (LBT), mandated in some European countries, to coexist with other Wi-Fi devices on the same band.&lt;ref name="LightRead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== MulteFire ==
MulteFire is another variant of LTE in unlicensed bands and has been proposed as a standalone version of LTE for small cells. This variant will use only the unlicensed spectrum as the primary and only carrier, and it will provide an opportunity for neutral hosts to deploy LTE in the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea of standalone operation of LTE in unlicensed bands was originally proposed by a small minority of vendors in 3GPP but rejected by the network operators who wanted the technology to be reliant on their licensed spectrum holdings. This technology is now developed by the [https://www.multefire.org/ MuLTEfire Alliance]. 

== Controversy ==
The proposed use of LTE-U by [[mobile phone network]] operators is the subject of controversy in the telecommunications industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/4g-lte/why-some-operators-think-lte-u-is-rude/a/d-id/708912|title=Why Some Operators Think LTE-U is Rude|author=Sarah Reedy|publisher=Light Reading|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2015, [[Google]] sent the [[Federal Communications Commission]] of the United States a 25-page protest, making an argument against LTE-U in highly technical detail.&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-iq0rxkyMLyVUxkNWtoUzItZDA/view|title=LTE and Wi-Fi in Unlicensed Spectrum: A Coexistence Study|author=Google, Inc.|first=|date=11 June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Google's study did not use actual LTE-U equipment in the tests, some industry experts have called its conclusions into question, with one commenter calling the study "utterly artificial and speculative" and "embarrassing".&lt;ref name=google-study-doubt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Richard|title=Can LTE Unlicensed Steamroll Wi-Fi?|url=http://hightechforum.org/can-lte-unlicensed-steamroll-wi-fi/|website=High Tech Forum|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] and [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] (NCTA) also voiced opposition to LTE-U approval before more testing can be done, citing concerns that it would severely degrade performance of other Wi-Fi devices.&lt;ref name=ars /&gt; Also in August 2015, [[Qualcomm]] responded to the allegations made in Google's whitepaper in a detailed filing with the [[FCC]].&lt;ref name=fcc-qcom-response&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Dean|title=REPLY COMMENTS OF QUALCOMM INCORPORATED|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60001104452|website=FCC.gov|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualcomm stated that it conducted tests that were "specifically designed to replicate (to the fullest extent possible) the test scenarios cited in Google’s FCC filing, in particular", and that they "collectively showed that LTE-U coexists very well with Wi-Fi when LTE-U is operating either above or below Wi-Fi’s Energy Detect ('ED') level." Qualcomm explained that the divergence in results was caused by the fact that "the testing the opposing parties conducted for LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence below the ED level utilized extremely pessimistic and impractical technical assumptions", whereas Qualcomm's tests were conducted "using a far more realistic setup", including actual LTE-U equipment (versus signal generators in Google's study).

In May 2016, the New York City Mayor's Office sent a letter to the FCC, 3GPP, Wi-Fi Alliance, and IEEE, expressing concern over LTE-U interference with Wi-Fi, given the City's broad investment in the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC Mayor's Office letter|url=https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/13045-fast-and-free/Flore_Nagata.a44d303c91c94c3d887ac9953ebaf66b.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2016|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns were discussed at a public event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast and Free New York's Vision for Public Wi-Fi Everywhere|url=https://www.newamerica.org/nyc/events/fast-and-free/|publisher=[[New America Foundation]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced its co-existence test plan would be ready in August. In FCC filings, Qualcomm, Verizon and T-Mobile said they plan to use this plan, some with the aim of full implementation before the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goovaerts|first1=Diana|title=LTE-U/Wi-Fi Co-existence Test Plan Coming In August|url=https://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2016/06/lte-u-wi-fi-co-existence-test-plan-coming-august|accessdate=5 August 2016|publisher=[[Wireless Week]]|date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2016, Qualcomm demurred.  “The latest version of the test plan released by the Wi-Fi Alliance lacks technical merit, is fundamentally biased against LTE-U, and rejects virtually all the input that Qualcomm provided for the last year, even on points that were not controversial,” said Dean Brenner, senior vice president of government affairs.&lt;ref name="Alleven"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alleven|first1=Monica|title=Wi-Fi group claims ‘extraordinary compromise’ on LTE-U, but Qualcomm begs to differ|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/wi-fi-group-claims-extraordinary-compromise-lte-u-but-qualcomm-begs-to-differ|accessdate=5 August 2016|publisher=[[FierceWireless]]|date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualcomm asserts that the plan biased in favor of Wi-Fi, and also that the testing regimen is extended to cover not just LTE-U, but also LAA, despite it already being a 3GPP standard.&lt;ref name="Alleven"/&gt; Verizon also opposed the test plan, saying it was "fundamentally unfair and biased".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/verizon-wi-fi-alliance-s-lte-u-test-plan-fundamentally-unfair-and-biased | title=Verizon: Wi-Fi Alliance’s LTE-U test plan ‘fundamentally unfair and biased’ | publisher=FierceWireless | date=Aug 12, 2016 | accessdate=August 16, 2016 | author=Dano, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests ==
In November 2016 Verizon, separate to the Wi-Fi Alliance coexistence plan, filed a Special Temporary Authority (STA) application with the FCC&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=184324&amp;x=. Verizon 5 GHz Experiment Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; to test 40 small cells in the 5Ghz band. According to a separate filing, Verizon will conduct the tests in Oklahoma City, Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, and Irving, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/verizon-to-test-pre-commercial-lte-u-small-cells-unlicensed-5-ghz-band| title=Verizon to test pre-commercial LTE-U small cells in unlicensed 5 GHz band| publisher=FierceWireless | date=Nov 11, 2016 | accessdate=August 16, 2016 | author=Dano, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, the FCC approved the use of LTE-U on base stations manufactured by Ericsson and Nokia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/freshly-fcc-approved-lte-u-wireless-rolls-out-on-t-mobile/| title=Freshly FCC-approved LTE-U wireless rolls out on T-Mobile this spring| publisher=TechCrunch | date=Feb 22, 2017 | accessdate=February 23, 2017 | author=Coldewey, Devin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 26, 2017, T-Mobile declared that they have successfully launched LTE-U in Bellevue, Washington; Brooklyn, New York; Dearborn, Michigan; Las Vegas, Nevada; Richardson, Texas; and Simi Valley, California.  More are rolling out this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-takes-lte-u-crown-launches-select-locations | title=T-Mobile takes LTE-U crown, launches in select locations| publisher=FierceWireless | date=June 26, 2017 | accessdate=June 26, 2017 | author=Alleven, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clip-on trackers ===

==== Fitbit Zip ====
[[ Image:White Fitbit Zip.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | A white Fitbit Zip, showing the distance in miles covered by the wearer. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced on September 17, 2012, the Fitbit Zip is about the size of [[Quarter (United States coin)|a United States quarter]] and tracks steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned. It is able to sync its data wirelessly to supported mobile devices.&lt;ref name="fitbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbit.com/devices|title=Fitbit Supported Devices|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wristband trackers ===

==== Fitbit Flex 2 ====
Released in 2017. It is waterproof and can track swimming. The tracker can be worn in a wristband or pendant, or carried in a pocket. The LED lights function similar to the original Flex, with the number of illuminated dots indicating progress toward the set goal. It features "reminder to move" alerts and vibrations when a call or text is received.

==== Fitbit Alta ====
The Fitbit Alta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgetswizard.com/fitbit-has-announced-a-customizable-fitness-band-the-alta/|title=Fitbit has announced a customizable fitness band – the Alta|date=February 4, 2016|work=gadgetswizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in February 2016. The wristband offers a full [[OLED]] screen that can be tapped for reminders, a clock and smartphone notifications. While not a touch screen, it is interacted with by tapping the band, similar to previous models. The Alta is also able to recognize the type of activity in progress: running, football or walking. 

==== Fitbit Alta HR ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Alta_HR_landscape.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Alta HR fitness tracker wristband showing heart rate monitor display. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Alta HR was released in March 2017. It has an added heart rate monitor. It includes the new Sleep Stages feature, which intends to show the stages of sleep, rather than just time asleep as in previous versions. 

====Fitbit Ace ====
Released in 2018, the Fitbit Ace is a variant of the Alta for children 8+ years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/ace|title=Fitbit Ace™ Kids Wristband|website=www.fitbit.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/03/13/fitbit-ace-tracker/|title=Ace is Fitbit’s new kid-focused fitness tracker|last=Bonifacic|first=Igor|date=13 March 2018|work=MobileSyrup|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fitbit Charge 3 ====
[[ Image:Charge 3.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Charge 3 displaying Time, Heart Rate, and Steps. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Charge 3 was released in October 2018. It has a heart rate sensor as well as an [[Pulse oximetry|oxygen saturation]] (SPO2) sensor. Sleep tracking has been improved from the Charge 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/fitbit-charge-3-review|title=Hands on: Fitbit Charge 3 review|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2018, a special edition of the Fitbit Charge 3 was released featuring "Fitbit Pay" as a special feature.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.fitbit.com/charge-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartwatches ===
==== Fitbit Ionic ====
[[ Image:FitbitIonicMomentDisplay.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Ionic in Slate Blue &amp; Burnt Orange. ]]
[[ Image:FitBitIonicWorkOutMode092917.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | The Fitbit Ionic in workout mode on Fitbit OS 1.0. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Ionic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3219717/software-health/meet-fitbit-ionic-a-little-smartwatch-a-lot-of-fitness-tracker.html|title=Meet Fitbit Ionic: A little smartwatch, a lot of fitness tracker|last1=Simon|first1=Michael|website=Macworld.com|publisher=macworld.com|accessdate=28 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in late September 2017. Designed to compete with the [[Apple Watch Series 3]], it is the successor to both the Blaze and the Surge. Like the Surge, the Ionic uses built-in GPS, using [[GLONASS]] to tap into global satellites and provide better accuracy when recording exercises, with the antenna being integrated into the watch case for a stronger connection. The Ionic also features SmartTrack, which auto-recognizes user activity and records it in the Fitbit app. The Ionic has interchangeable bands, including classic Fitbit bands, leather bands, and perforated bands for a more sport-like appearance, and the release mechanism has been modified to make swapping out bands easier. It is also water-resistant, making it safe to wear when swimming. Many of the Blaze's clock faces return, as do several new clock faces. New to the Ionic is the ability to load apps onto the watch itself such as [[AccuWeather]] and [[Starbucks]], as well as an NFC chip that allows the Ionic to be used for credit card purchases at places that allow contactless payment. As a result, the tactile buttons on the Ionic have some new functions. When not in workout mode, the right side buttons now function as shortcuts for the leftmost two apps loaded onto the watch, while a long press on the left side button brings up Fitbit Pay as well as music and quick settings. The Ionic is shipped in three color combinations of the wristband and watch case: Charcoal &amp; Smoke Gray, Slate Blue &amp; Burnt Orange, and Blue Gray &amp; Silver Gray.

In 2018, the Ionic was updated to Fitbit OS 2.0 alongside the release of the Versa. The most notable change from OS 1.0 is the addition of a new app called Fitbit Today, a much more intuitive and informative dashboard displaying the user's health and fitness data. It is accessible by swiping up from the clock face, while the notification tray is now accessed by swiping down from the clock face. In addition, a long press on the back button now opens up the music controls, payments, and the shortcuts screen, instead of just Fitbit Pay. In July 2018, Fitbit announced the 15+ Best Fitbit OS Apps for Travel, that can be downloaded in Ionic and some are also available in Versa.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.fitbit.com/best-apps-for-travel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fitbit Versa ====
Released in April 2018, it has a square design with round edges, similar to the Apple Watch and Pebble watches. It retains most of the Ionic's features and interface. It is capable of tracking women's menstrual cycles. It does not have built-in GPS like the Ionic, instead using connected GPS like the Blaze. 

There are two variants of the Versa; the standard edition and the Special Edition. The standard Versa comes in three colors: Black, Rose Gold, and Silver. The Special Edition comes in two colors: Rose Gold with a Lavender band, and Graphite with a Charcoal band. They also include woven wristbands.

=== Smart scales ===

==== Fitbit Aria 2 ====
[[ Image:Fitbit Aria 2.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Aria 2 in black. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Aria 2 was announced in August 2017 concurrently with the Ionic. The Aria 2 has been re-engineered for greater accuracy and easier Bluetooth setup. The Aria 2 also has personalized face icons and greetings, compatibility with more Wi-Fi networks, and has an increased weight tolerance of up to 400 pounds.

=== Fitbit wireless headphones ===

==== Fitbit Flyer ====
Sweatproof wireless earphones by Fitbit. Has noise isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/flyer|title=Fitbit Flyer™ Wireless Fitness Headphones|website=www.fitbit.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discontinued Fitbit products ==

=== Clip-on trackers ===

==== Fitbit Tracker ====
The Fitbit Tracker was a small black and teal device that could be clipped discreetly onto clothing and worn 24/7. It uses a three-dimensional [[accelerometer]] to sense user movement. The Tracker measures steps taken and combines it with user data to calculate distance walked, calories burned, floors climbed and activity duration and intensity. It uses an [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED display]] to display this and other information such as the battery level. It also measures sleep quality by tracking periods of restlessness, how long it takes the wearer to fall asleep and how long they are actually asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/11/fitbit-tracker-pedometer-lifestyle-heatlh-lifetracking.html|title=Getting Fitbit|last=Ewalt|first=David M.|date=June 11, 2010|publisher=Forbes|access-date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wireless]] base station is included to receive data from the Tracker and to charge its battery. When connected to a computer, the base station will upload data to the Fitbit website, where a number of features are available: seeing an overview of physical activity, setting and tracking goals, keeping food and activity logs and interacting with friends. Use of the website is free.

The Fitbit Classic tracked only steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, activity intensity and sleep.

At the [[TechCrunch50]] during the "Mobile" session on September 9, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/21361/page1/|title=Self Surveillance|last=Greene|first=Kate|date=September 10, 2008|work=Technology Review|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit received positive reactions during its panel from experts like [[Rafe Needleman]], [[Tim O'Reilly]], and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] who cited its wearability, price, and lack of subscription fees.

==== Fitbit Ultra ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Ultra_-_teal.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Ultra activity tracker in teal clipped to pocket. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Ultra was announced on October 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fitbit.com/?p=522|title=Fitbit Blog|work=Fitbit Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new features included:

* an [[altimeter]] that measures elevation gain in terms of floors, with one floor roughly equivalent to ten feet
* a digital clock visible on the device's display
* a [[stopwatch]] that can be used to time activities
* randomized "Chatter" messages show when the Ultra is moved after sitting idle for a while
* new colors

The Fitbit Ultra is powered by a small [[lithium polymer battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.takeitapart.com/guide/11|title=Fitbit Ultra|work=takeitapart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fitbit Ultra suffered from a small design flaw: the unit had a permanently curved shape in order to clip directly onto any piece of clothing. The plastic used in the unit was not appropriate for the strain experienced at the looped end, and with time would become brittle, and crack. While most users experienced only minor cracking with no effects to the device's function, in a few cases the cracking led to total failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatguyshrinking.com/fitbit-ultra-repair/|title=Fitbit Ultra Repair|website=www.fatguyshrinking.com|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azurelunatic.dreamwidth.org/7102302.html|title=Fitbit!

==== Fitbit One ====
Announced on September 17, 2012, the Fitbit One is an update to the Fitbit Ultra that uses a more vivid digital display, has a separate clip and a separate charging cable and wireless sync [[dongle]].&lt;ref name="Co.Design article about new One"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670906/fitbits-newest-gadget-247-fitness-tracking-meets-247-app-syncing#1|title=Fitbit's Newest Gadget: 24/7 Fitness Tracking Meets 24/7 App Syncing|last=Wilson|first=Mark|work=Co.Design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip were the first wireless activity trackers to sync using Bluetooth 4.0 or [[Bluetooth SMART]] technology. The wireless syncing is currently available on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices such as the iPhone 4S and higher, iPad 3rd generation, iPod touch 5th generation, Samsung Galaxy Note II and higher, [[Samsung Galaxy S III]] and higher, LG G2, HTC One, Moto X, and Nexus 4 or higher.&lt;ref name="fitbit.com" /&gt; Fitbit One can record several daily activities, including but not limited to, number of steps taken, distance traveled on foot, number of floors climbed, calories burned, vigorously active minutes, and sleep efficiency.

=== Wristband trackers ===

==== Fitbit Flex ====
[[ Image:Fitibit_Flex.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Flex with accompanying wristband. ]]
{{Clear}}
In May 2013, Fitbit released the Fitbit Flex, the first Fitbit tracker worn on the wrist. It tracks movement 24 hours a day, including sleep patterns. It has a simple display of 5 LED lights that indicate the progress toward the goal number of steps walked in a day and vibrates to indicate when the goal has been reached. The sync functions are similar to the Fitbit One and Zip. The Flex is the most water-resistant tracker, though cannot be worn while swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/au/flex#features|title=Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity &amp; Sleep Wristband – Specifications|publisher=Fitbit|quote=Flex has been tested up to 1 ATM meaning it is sweat, rain and splash proof. However, the device is not swim proof.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a specialized USB charger; the battery lasts 5–7 days, and it takes 1–2 hours to charge.

==== Fitbit Force ====
The Fitbit Force was announced on October 10, 2013. It has an OLED display&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitgadgetreviews.com/fitbit-force-review/|title=The best activity tracker yet... The Fitbit Force reviewed}}&lt;/ref&gt; that shows time and daily activity. The Force tracks a number of statistics in real-time, including steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed and active minutes throughout the day. At night, the Force tracks sleep and can wake a user silently with a vibrating alarm.

On January 13, 2014 it was reported that an unconfirmed number of Fitbit customers had complained about skin irritation after wearing the Force for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/14/fitbit-apologies-_n_4599193.html|title=Fitbit Apologizes To Customers Who've Experienced Skin Reactions|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit stated on its website that the company consulted with medical professionals whose assessments are that these irritations are most likely [[Allergic contact dermatitis|allergic reactions to nickel]], a component of the surgical-grade steel or the adhesives used to assemble the Fitbit Force.&lt;ref name="ForceCEO"&gt;[https://www.fitbit.com/forcesupport CEO letter 2/20/14]. February 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit, working with the Consumer Protection Safety Commission, recalled the Fitbit Force on February 20, 2014.&lt;ref name="ForceCEO" /&gt; On March 12, 2014 the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) made the recall official.&lt;ref name="ForceRecall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2014/Fitbit-Recalls-Force-Activity-Tracking-Wristband/|title=Fitbit Recalls Force Activity-Tracking Wristband Due to Risk of Skin Irritation|date=12 March 2014|work=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was revealed that The Fitbit Force had caused about 9,900 injuries.&lt;ref name="ForceRecall" /&gt; It is no longer for sale on Fitbit's website.

==== Fitbit Charge ====
Announced in October 2014, the Fitbit Charge is intended as a replacement for the recalled Fitbit Force. It was released in November 2014 for US$130 retail. The Charge's wrist band is textured and has a screen that can display caller ID information from a connected smartphone through the Fitbit app. The Charge automatically tracks users' steps, sleep, flights of stairs (using an altimeter) and an approximation of distance traveled. It tracks steps using a 3 axis accelerometer by tracking forward movement along with upward movements.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;Burns, Matt (October 27, 2014). "[https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/fitbits-latest-activity-trackers-feature-heartheart-monitoring-smartwatch-functions/ Fitbit's Latest Activity Trackers Feature Heart Monitoring, Smartwatch Functions]".

==== Fitbit Charge HR ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Charge_HR.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Charge HR. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced in October 2014 and released in early January 2015, the Charge HR is similar to the Charge, with an additional heart-rate monitor. With this addition, the 7-day battery life is reduced to 5 days. The Charge HR has the same textured band as the Charge and comes in black, plum, blue, tangerine, pink, and teal colors. The Charge HR band clasp resembles that of a traditional watch instead of the snap-on band of the original Charge, as the band needs to fit tightly for the heart rate feature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/chargehr#specs|title=Fitbit Charge HR Wireless Heart Rate + Activity Wristband|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Matt.

==== Fitbit Charge 2 ====
The Fitbit Charge 2 featured a new multi-sport mode allowing users to start workouts from their Fitbit. Compared to its predecessor it had a larger screen.

=== Smartwatches ===

==== Fitbit Surge ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Surge.JPG | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Surge. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced in October 2014, the Surge was a [[smartwatch]] and an activity tracker. It features a heart-rate monitor and the ability to track pace, distance, and elevation using the GPS on the device. The Surge also can send alerts of text and incoming calls from a connected smartphone.

The Surge was discontinued in late 2017.

==== Fitbit Blaze ====
[[ Image:FitBitBlazeMomentDisplay.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Blaze. ]]
{{Clear}}
Released in January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10702524/fitbit-blaze-fitness-tracker-watch-lcd-announced-ces-2016|title=Fitbit's new wearable is a fitness watch called Blaze|last=Goode|first=Lauren|date=January 5, 2016|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fitbit Blaze is a smartwatch made to compete with the [[Apple Watch]], [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]], and [[Android Wear]]. The Blaze comes with a colored touchscreen, and exchangeable strap and frame. It can auto-tracking exercises and has a heart-rate monitor. Blaze has connected GPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvedic.com/uk/innovation-and-revolution/ces-2016-highlights/|title=CES 2016 highlights|work=Techvedic}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it tracks location using the connected smartphone's GPS. It can display notifications, including incoming calls, texts and calendar appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Cipriani, Jason (March 29, 2016). "[http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-setup-use-fitbit-blaze-smartwatch/ Getting started with the Fitbit Blaze]". CNET.&lt;/ref&gt; The Blaze introduces the Sleep Stages feature.

The Fitbit Blaze also integrates with Fitstar, Fitbit's website for customized workouts. These workouts can be displayed on the Blaze's screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-blaze-review|title=Fitbit Blaze review|last=Stables|first=James|date=March 3, 2016|work=Wareable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blaze was discontinued in early 2018.

==== Fitbit Aria ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Aria.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Aria. ]]
{{Clear}}
In April 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdgt.com/fitbit/|title=Fitbit|work=Engadget|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303003913/http://gdgt.com/fitbit/|archive-date=2010-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit released a [[weighing scale]] called the Fitbit Aria. It recognizes users and measures weight, body mass index ([[Body mass index|BMI]]) and percentage of body fat of the user. It can keep track of eight individual users and updates information to fitbit.com automatically via Wi-Fi network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbit.com/product/aria|title=Fitbit Aria™ Wi-Fi Smart Scale|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is also updated to smartphone apps.

[[File:Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.jpg|right|thumb|Cape Canaveral Missile Row in 1964]]
'''Missile Row''' was a nickname given in the 1960s to the US Air Force and [[NASA]] launch complexes at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS). Operated by the [[45th Space Wing]] of the [[U.S. Air Force]] since 1949, it was the site of all pre-[[Apollo 8]] manned launches, as well as many other early [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and NASA launches. For the DoD, it plays a secondary role to [[Vandenberg AFB]] in [[California]], but is the launch site for many NASA unmanned [[space probe]]s, as those spacecraft are typically launched on [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] launchers. Active launch vehicles are in '''bold'''.

Much of the support activity for CCAFS occurs at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] to the south, its reporting base.

A '''mobile community''' is a group of people generally united by shared interests or goals who interact: 

* considering their context (e.g. time, space, social),
* by means of location-independent information technology,
* and also including mobile access to existing community infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;Rannenberg, Kai, Denis Royer, and André Deuker, eds. "The future of identity in the information society: Challenges and opportunities." Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''Mobile technology''' is the technology used for [[Cellular network|cellular communication]]. Mobile [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) technology has evolved rapidly over the past few years. Since the start of this millennium, a standard mobile device has gone from being no more than a simple two-way [[pager]] to being a [[mobile phone]], [[GPS navigation device]], an embedded [[web browser]] and [[instant messaging]] client, and a [[handheld gaming console]]. Many experts believe that the future of computer technology rests in [[mobile computing]] with [[wireless network]]ing. Mobile computing by way of tablet computers are becoming more popular. Tablets are available on the [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks.

==Mobile phone generations==
{{main|List of mobile phone generations}}

In the early 1980s, [[1G]] was introduced as voice-only communication via "brick phones".&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/1g-vs-2g-vs-2-5g-vs-3g-vs-4g-578681 |title=1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, &amp; 5G Explained |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Fendelman, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1991, the development of [[2G]] introduced [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) and [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) capabilities, allowing picture messages to be sent and received between phones.&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; In 1998, 3G was introduced to provide faster data-transmission speeds to support [[video calling]] and [[internet]] access. [[4G]] was released in 2008 to support more demanding services such as [[Mobile gaming|gaming services]], HD [[mobile TV]], [[Video conference|video conferencing]], and [[3D TV]].&lt;ref name="lifewire_phone_gens"/&gt; [[5G]] technology has been planned for the upcoming future.

===4G networking===
{{main|4G}}

4G is the current mainstream  cellular service offered to cell phone users, performance roughly 10 times faster than [[3G]] service.&lt;ref name="lifewire_4g"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4g-wireless-577577 |work=[[Lifewire]] |accessdate=2018-02-27 |date=2017-12-18 |author=Cassavoy, Liane |title=What is 4G wireless?}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important features in the [[4G]] mobile networks is the domination of high-speed [[packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions or burst traffic in the channels. The same codes used in the [[2G]]-[[3G]] networks are applied to 4G mobile or wireless networks, the detection of very short bursts will be a serious problem due to their very poor partial correlation properties. Recent study has indicated that traditional multilayer network architecture based on the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model may not be well suited for 4G mobile network, where transactions of short packets will be the major part of the traffic in the channels. As the packets from different mobiles carry completely different channel characteristics, the receiver should execute all necessary [[algorithm]]s, such as channel estimation, interactions with all upper layers and so on, within a very short period of time.

==Operating systems==
Many types of [[mobile operating system]]s (OS) are available for [[smartphone]]s, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[webOS]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]] Professional (touch screen), Windows Mobile Standard (non-touch screen), and [[Bada]]. The most popular are the Apple iPhone, and the newest: Android. Android, a mobile OS developed by [[Google]], is the first completely [[Open-source model|open-source]] mobile OS, meaning that it is free to any cell phone [[mobile network]].

Since 2008 customizable OSs allow the user to download [[Mobile app|apps]] like games, GPS, utilities, and other tools. Users can also create their own apps and publish them, e.g. to Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. The [[Palm Pre]] using [[webOS]] has functionality over the [[Internet]] and can support Internet-based programming languages such as [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), [[HTML]], and [[JavaScript]]. The [[Research In Motion]] (RIM) [[BlackBerry]] is a smartphone with a multimedia player and third-party software installation. The Windows Mobile Professional Smartphones ([[Pocket PC]] or Windows Mobile PDA) are like [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA) and have [[touchscreen]] abilities. The Windows Mobile Standard does not have a touch screen but uses a [[trackball]], [[touchpad]], or rockers.

==Channel hogging and file sharing==
There will be a hit to file sharing, the normal web surfer would want to look at a new web page every minute or so at 100 kbs a page loads quickly.{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}} Because of the changes to the security of wireless networks users will be unable to do huge file transfers because service providers want to reduce channel use. [[AT&amp;T]] claimed that they would ban any of their users that they caught using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] applications on their 3G network. It then became apparent that it would keep any of their users from using their iTunes programs. The users would then be forced to find a [[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Wi-Fi hotspot]] to be able to download files. The limits of wireless networking will not be cured by 4G, as there are too many fundamental differences between wireless networking and other means of Internet access. If wireless vendors do not realize these differences and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] limits, future wireless customers will find themselves disappointed and the market may suffer setbacks.

== Impacts on the modern family ==
Increasing mobile technology use has changed how the modern family interacts with one another through technology. With the rise of mobile devices, families are becoming increasingly "on-the-move",&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Katie Headrick|last2=Takeuchi|first2=Lori|last3=Stevens|first3=Reed|year=2017|title=Mapping the daily media round: novel methods for understanding families’ mobile technology use|journal=Learning, Media and Technology|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/17439884.2017.1391286|issn=1743-9884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spend less time in physical contact with one another. However, this trend does not mean that families are no longer interacting with each other, but rather have evolved into a more digitized variant. A study has shown that the modern family actually learns better with usage of mobile media,&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; and children are more willing to cooperate with their parents via a digital medium than a more direct approach. For example, family members can share information from articles or online videos via mobile devices and thus stay connected with one another during a busy day.

This trend is not without controversy, however. Many parents of [[elementary school]]-age children express concern and sometimes disapproval of heavy mobile technology use.&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; Parents may feel that excessive usage of such technologies distracts children from "un-plugged" bonding experiences, and many express safety concerns about children using mobile media. While parents may have many concerns are, they are not necessarily [[anti-technology]].&lt;ref name="TaylorTakeuchi2017" /&gt; In fact, many parents express approval of mobile technology usage if their children can learn something from the session. for example, through art or music tutorials on [[YouTube]].

==Future of smartphones==
The next generation of smartphones will be context-aware, taking advantage of the growing availability of embedded physical sensors and data exchange abilities. One of the main features applying to this is that phones will start keeping track of users' personal data, and adapt to anticipate the information will need.  All-new applications will come out with the new phones, one of which is an X-ray device that reveals information about any location at which the phone is pointed. Companies are developing software to take advantage of more accurate location-sensing data. This has been described as making the phone a virtual mouse able to click the real world.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} An example would be pointing the phone's camera at a building while having the live feed open, and the phone will show text with the image of the building, and save its location for use in the future.

[[Omnitouch]] is a device via which apps can be viewed and used on a hand, arm, wall, desk, or any other everyday surface. The device uses a sensor touch interface, which enables the user to access all the functions through the use of the touch of a finger. It was developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This device uses a projector and camera worn on the user's shoulder, with no controls other than the user's fingers.

'''NCL Eclipse''' is a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] aiming at supporting the development of [[Nested Context Language]] applications. NCL is the declarative standard language for [[ISDB-T International|ISDB-Tb]] (International System for Digital Broadcast Terrestrial Brazilian) and also is [[ITU-T]] standard for [[IPTV]] systems. NCL Eclipse was first developed by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br Laws Lab] and it is currently jointly maintained by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br  Laws] and [http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br  TeleMídia] Labs.

''NCL Eclipse'' is free software, available at [http://www.softwarepublico.gov.br/ Brazilian Public Software Portal] under [[GPL#Version 2|GNU GPLv2]] license.

As an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] plug-in NCL Eclipse can be easily integrated with others plug-ins---for instance, those supporting other ISDB-Tb and ITU-T standard languages (such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]).

==NCL Eclipse Historical Evolution==

===NCL Eclipse 1.0 ===
The first stable version of NCL Eclipse was named "NCL Eclipse 1.0". This version has included support to syntax highlighting, folding (which allows the author to hide parts of source code according with his needs), wizards to create simple documents, auto-formatting, document, marking error validation, contextual content suggestion and an outline view (which shows the document content as a tree). To provide the marking error validation, all NCL Eclipse versions uses the [[NCL Validator]] (validation framework of NCL documents). This first version was very well accepted by the community of NCL developers, which gave several feedbacks. The NCL Eclipse evolution is strongly based on these feedbacks.

===NCL Eclipse 1.4 ===
The NCL Eclipse 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 have focused mainly on fixing bugs from the previous version. The next big changes came with 1.4 version of NCL Eclipse. That version brings program visualization, media previews and hypertext navigation. Additionally, a new plug-in aimed to integrate NCL Eclipse with NCL Club was included in the same package. As pointed out before, the integration with NCL Club allows for beginners to start learning NCL based on real-world examples. The internationalization support for English, Spanish and Portuguese was also included in this version.

===NCL Eclipse 1.5 ===
The latest stable, and current version, is "NCL Eclipse 1.5". This version contains some improvements in source code. As new feature, this version came with support to semi-automatic error correction and option to run the NCL document, provided by a virtual machine running the Ginga-NCL emulator.

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005).

London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price |location=Madison |publisher=Prehistory Press |year=1992 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binford |first=Lewis R. |year=1968 |chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations |title=New Perspectives in Archaeology |editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |location=Chicago |pages=313–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]] posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by [[David Rindos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|date=December 1987|isbn=978-0125892810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.
* [[Peter Richerson]], [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]], and [[Robert Bettinger]]&lt;ref name="Richersonetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Richerson|first = Peter J.|authorlink =|year = 2001|title = Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?|journal = American Antiquity|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 387–411|doi = 10.2307/2694241|displayauthors = etal |jstor = 2694241|last2 = Boyd|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the [[Holocene]].

* The postulated [[Younger Dryas event|Younger Dryas impact event]], claimed to be in part responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafauna extinction]] and ending the last [[glacial period]], could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David G|author2=Albert C.

* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.E.

Volume 6, Number 2 / September 2007 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

===In the Americas===
{{further|New World Crops|Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Oasisamerica|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C. A. |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; squash as early as 6000 BC, and beans by no later than 4000 BC. [[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as [[V. Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N.

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27390">[[Image:Network effect.png|right|thumb|Diagram showing the network effect in a few simple phone networks. The lines represent potential calls between phones.]]

A '''network effect''' (also called '''network externality''' or '''demand-side economies of scale''') is the positive effect described in [[economics]] and [[business]] that an additional user of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] has on the [[Value (economics)|value]] of that product to others.  When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite book |title=Information Rules |author=Carl Shapiro and Hal R. Varian |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |isbn=0-87584-863-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic example is the [[telephone]], where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive [[externality]] is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless. [[Online social network]]s work similarly, with sites like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] increasing in value to each member as more users join.

The network effect can create a [[bandwagon effect]] as the network becomes more valuable and more people join, resulting in a [[positive feedback]] loop.

The expression "network effect" is applied to positive network externalities as in the case of the telephone. Negative network externalities can also occur, where more users make a product less valuable, but they are more commonly referred to as "congestion" (as in [[traffic congestion]] or [[network congestion]]).

==Origins==
Network effects were a central theme in the arguments of [[Theodore Vail]], the first [[The Telephone Cases|post-patent]] president of [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]], in gaining a monopoly on US telephone services. In 1908, when he presented the concept in Bell's annual report, there were over 4,000 local and regional telephone exchanges, most of which were eventually merged into the [[Bell System]].

Network effects were popularized by [[Robert Metcalfe]], stated as [[Metcalfe's law]]. Metcalfe was one of the co-inventors of [[Ethernet]] and a co-founder of the company [[3Com]]. In selling the product, Metcalfe argued that customers needed Ethernet cards to grow above a certain [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] if they were to reap the benefits of their network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0507/052.html |title=It's All In Your Head |publisher=Forbes |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Metcalfe, the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was that the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of cards installed, but the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users. This was expressed algebraically as having a cost of N, and a value of N². While the actual numbers behind this proposition were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and eventually access the Internet.

The economic theory of the network effect was advanced significantly between 1985 and 1995 by researchers Michael L. Katz, Carl Shapiro, Joseph Farrell and Garth Saloner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The economics of standards: theory, evidence, policy |author=Knut Blind |year=2004 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1-84376-793-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author, high-tech entrepreneur [[Rod Beckstrom]] presented a mathematical model for describing networks that are in a state of positive network effect at BlackHat and Defcon in 2009 and also presented the "inverse network effect" with an economic model for defining it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/31/facebook-bill-gates-technology-security-defcon.html |title=How To Value Your Networks |publisher=Forbes |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |first=Taylor |last=Buley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
Network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved, called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value exceeding the price.

A key business concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass. One way is to rely on extrinsic motivation, such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value ''without'' network effects, at least to [[early adopters]]. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.

Beyond critical mass, the increasing number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely.  After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake.  Congestion occurs due to overuse.  The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network.  While the number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds additional value to every other customer.  However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system.  After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user.  In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system load, leading to [[busy signal]]s, the inability to get a [[dial tone]], and poor [[customer support]].  Assuming the congestion point is below the potential market size, the next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid.  The network will cease to grow at this point if system capacity is not improved. [[Peer-to-peer]] (P2P) systems are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows P2P networks to scale indefinitely. The P2P based telephony service [[Skype]] benefits from this effect and its growth is limited primarily by [[market saturation]].

Network effects are commonly mistaken for [[economies of scale]], which result from business size rather than [[interoperability]].  To help clarify the distinction, people speak of [[demand|demand side]] vs. [[supply side]] economies of scale.  Classical economies of scale are on the [[economic production|production]] side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network effects are also mistaken for [[economies of scope]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Because of the positive feedback often associated with the network effect, [[system dynamics]] can be used as a modelling method to describe the phenomena. [[Word of mouth]] and the [[Bass diffusion model]] are also potentially applicable.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

Network effect is a benefit to society as a whole because it positively relates to and affects the Intellectual Commons, Property Rights, and Cultural Commons of the world. One form of network externality is social media, which is a peer-to-peer network run by a privately held for profit business. Although the creation of a large network creates a barrier to entry according to [[Porter five forces analysis|Porters five forces]] and may prevent a few from creating a new form of P2P networking, it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common-pool resource so largely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it. Although the barrier to entry may be high, there is no true form of monopoly in the P2P social sharing market. For example, Facebook holds a large stake in the P2P social sharing market, but it is not mutually exclusive, meaning users can have an account on Facebook and also have an account on Twitter. Furthermore, there becomes no true critical mass in this space due to the ability for technology and innovation to constantly adapt to different environments, market for underdeveloped countries to integrate with social sharing is unlimited.

Network effect relates to the intellectual commons in a positive way. Through P2P networks users are able to share their intellectual property in a way that can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of [[intellectual property]] ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com is an example of how intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences are sharing their education on a public forum that benefits whoever will listen. Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.

P2P networks positively affect property rights. In reference to [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], it enables those who create the intellectual property: The right to use the good, The right to earn income from the good, The right to transfer the good to others, The right to enforcement of property rights. Through P2P networks those who provide intellectual property not only have these rights, but they also possess the right to claim their information on a public forum. Due to these rights sharing benefits the intellectual property holders and promotes P2P sharing in a positive way. Those who consume the intellectual property also benefit positively from the sharing of it because they are able to use the information freely with respect to the person who created it. An example of this system in effect is a company called [https://www.facebook.com/TheVault.TX Music Vault]. Music Vault operates on the P2P network Facebook, enabling users who create music to openly and freely collaborate with other artists content. This is a form of remixing that benefits both parties. This is an example of how a P2P network positively affects the sharing of property rights. In Joseph E. Stiglitz essay ''Prizes, Not Patents'', he suggests that the creation of intellectual property should be rewarded with by social gratification and rewards instead of patents preventing others from duplicating the creation and sharing it as a common-pool resource. This can be related to P2P networking because it creates a greater incentive for those who create intellectual property to share it is a common-pool resource. As a P2P sharing network becomes larger the gratification of being rewarded on a global public forum would compete with a patent. It is through large P2P networks and network externality that humans can create a reward system large enough to deter seekers of patents to be rewarded in different ways.

Network Externality positively affects the cultural commons in many ways. The reward for being part of a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network is one of the greatest benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html |title=The child-driven education}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.

==Technology lifecycle==
{{see also|Technology lifecycle}}
If some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a [[disruptive technology]] or [[open standards]] based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger. In this model, a tipping point is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Lock-in==
Not surprisingly [[network economics]] became a hot topic after the diffusion of the [[Internet]] across [[academia]]. Most people know only of [[Metcalfe's law]] as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing [[Vendor lock-in|lock-in]] with the most-cited examples being [[Microsoft]] products and the [[QWERTY]] keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Strategy Analysis  |author=Robert M. Grant |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-470-74710-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vendor lock-in can be mitigated by opening the standards upon which users depend, allowing competition between implementations.  This does not, however, mitigate industry-wide lock-in to the standard itself.  Indeed, as there are now multiple vendors driving down the price and increasing the quality, more users are likely to adopt the standard thereby creating greater industry-wide lock-in to the standard.

==Types==
Broadly, there are two kinds of networks effects:

*Direct network effects: An increase in usage leads to a direct increase in value for other users. For example, telephone systems, fax machines, and social networks all imply direct contact among users. A direct network effect is called a '''same-side''' network effect. An example is online gamers who benefit from participation of other gamers.
*Indirect network effects: Increases in usage of one product or network spawn increases in the value of a complementary product or network, which can in turn increase the value of the original. Examples of complementary goods include [[software]] (such as an Office suite for operating systems) and DVDs (for DVD players). This is why Windows and Linux might compete not just for users, but for [[software developer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2005/487/Two-sided.pdf |title=Two-sided competition of proprietary vs. open source technology platforms and the implications for the software industry |author=Nicholas Economides and Evangelos Katsamakas |date=May 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also called a '''cross-side''' network effect. Most two-sided markets (or platform-mediated markets) are characterized by indirect network effects.

Additionally, there are two sources of [[economic value]] that are relevant when analyzing products that display network effects:
*Inherent value: I derive value from my use of the product
*Network value: I derive value from other people's use of the product

==Negative network externalities==
{{See also|Negative feedback}}
Negative network externalities, in the mathematical sense, are those that have a negative effect compared to normal (positive) network effects. Just as positive network externalities (network effects) cause [[positive feedback]] loops and [[exponential growth]], negative network externalities create [[negative feedback]] and [[exponential decay]]. In nature, negative network externalities are the forces that pull towards equilibrium, are responsible for stability, and are the physical limitations preventing states from reaching infinity.

*Congestion occurs when the efficiency of a network decreases as more people use it, and this reduces the value to people already using it. [[Traffic congestion]] that overloads the freeway and [[network congestion]] over limited bandwidth both display negative network externalities.
*[[Braess' paradox]] occurs when the following counterintuitive phenomenon: removing edges from a selfish routing network can decrease the latency incurred by all of the traffic at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lin|first1=Henry|last2=Roughgarden|first2=Tim|last3=Tardos|first3=Éva |last4=Walkover|first4=Asher|title=Stronger Bounds on Braess's Paradox and the Maximum Latency of Selfish Routing.|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/mcbp.pdf|website=Stanford Theory|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability==
[[Interoperability]] has the effect of making the network bigger and thus increases the external value of the network to consumers. Interoperability achieves this primarily by increasing potential connections and secondarily by attracting new participants to the network. Other benefits of interoperability include reduced uncertainty, reduced lock-in, [[commoditization]] and competition based on price.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt;{{rp|229}}

Interoperability can be achieved through [[standardization]] or other cooperation. Companies involved in fostering interoperability face a tension between cooperating with their competitors to grow the potential market for products and competing for market share.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt;{{rp|227}}

==Open versus closed standards==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
In communication and information technologies, open standards and interfaces are often developed through the participation of multiple companies and are usually perceived to provide mutual benefit.  But, in cases in which the relevant communication protocols or interfaces are closed standards the network effect can give the company controlling those standards monopoly power. The [[Microsoft]] corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means. One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called [[Embrace, extend and extinguish]].

[[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] is an [[Israel]]i start-up which pioneered [[instant messaging]] (IM) and was bought by [[AOL|America Online]]. By giving away their [[ICQ]] product [[Free as in beer|for free]] and preventing interoperability between their client [[software]] and other products, they were able to temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.

==Examples==
{{Missing information|credit cards|date=February 2011}}

===Financial exchanges===
[[Stock exchange]]s and [[derivatives exchanges]] feature a network effect.  [[Market liquidity]] is a major determinant of [[transaction cost]] in the sale or purchase of a security, as a [[bid–ask spread]] exists between the price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the same security can be done.  As the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease.  This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange.

The network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange.  For example, the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bond|US Treasury bond]] futures despite the startup of [[Eurex]] US trading of identical futures contracts.  Similarly, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] has maintained a dominance in trading of Eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from [[Euronext.Liffe]].

===Software===
There are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely used computer software.

For many people choosing an [[office suite]], prime considerations include how much value having learned that office suite will prove to potential [[employer]]s, and how well the software interoperates with other users.  That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, users want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers and clients, and they also want to be able to share documents. Similarly, finding already-trained [[employee]]s is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.

In 2007 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released the [[iPhone]] followed by the app store. Most iPhone apps rely heavily on the existence of strong network effects. This enables the software to grow in popularity very quickly and spread to a large userbase with very limited marketing needed. The [[Freemium]] business model has evolved to take advantage of these network effects by releasing a free version that will not limit the adoption or any users and then charge for "premium" features as the primary source of revenue.

===Web sites===
Many [[web site]]s benefit from a network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, [[eBay]] would not be a particularly useful site if [[auction]]s were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.

Network effects were used as justification for some of the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] [[business model]]s in the late 1990s. These firms operated under the belief that when a new [[Market (economics)|market]] comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their [[market share]] than about becoming [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]].  This was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus determine the basis of future [[competition]].

[[Social networking]] websites are good examples. The more people register onto a social networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belvaux|first=Bertrand|title=The Development of Social Media: Proposal for a Diffusion Model Incorporating Network Externalities in a Competitive Environment|journal=Recherche et Applications en Marketing - English Version|year=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=7–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexa Internet]] uses a technology that tracks users' surfing patterns; thus Alexa's Related Sites results improve as more users use the technology. Alexa's network relies heavily on a small number of browser software relationships, which makes the network more vulnerable to competition.

Google has also attempted to create a network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service.  [[Google AdSense]] places ads on many small sites, such as [[blog]]s, using Google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs.  Thus, the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching many advertisers with many small sites (such as blogs).  In general, the more blogs Google AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it the most attractive option for more blogs, and so on, making the network more valuable for all participants.

By contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles, not to the number of other people using the site.  Similarly, the first generation of search sites experienced little network effect, as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results.  This allowed [[Google]] to win users away from [[Yahoo!]] without much trouble, once users believed that Google's search results were superior.  Some commentators mistook the value of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a network effect protecting its advertising business.

===Rail gauge===
[[Image:Rail gauge world.svg|thumb|350px|The dominant rail gauge in each country shown]]
There are strong network effects in the initial choice of [[rail gauge]], and in [[gauge conversion]] decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works with one of the standard rail gauges.

'''New Lab''' opened in June, 2016, as a multi-disciplinary technology center. Housed in Building 128 of the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the $35 million project&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-lab-brooklyn-navy-yard-reborn-as-a-high-tech-center/|title=The Brooklyn Navy Yard's rebirth as a high-tech center|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a hardware-focused [[shared workspace]], research lab, and hatchery for socially-oriented tech manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digital.nyc/news/how-old-shipyard-became-home-hardware-startups|title=How an Old Shipyard Became a Home for Hardware Startups|date=2017-02-21|work=Digital.NYC|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[MIT Media Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/|title=News &amp; Updates – MIT Media Lab|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a model, the impetus for the independent organization was to provide space and services to new manufacturing enterprises. Current members work in fields such as robotics, connected devices, energy, nanotechnology, life sciences, and urban tech.

Media coverage of New Lab has focused on the company's role in revitalizing the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.surfacemag.com/articles/brooklyn-navy-yard-waterfront-development-interview/|title=Renaissance Plan - SURFACE|date=2016-11-16|work=SURFACE|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; its public-private partnership lease structure, and Urban Tech initiative with the [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|New York CIty Economic Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-launches-urban-tech-nyc-support-companies-building-smart-and-sustainable-cities|title=NYCEDC Launches Urbantech NYC to Support Companies Building Smart And Sustainable Cities|work=NYCEDC|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyns-new-lab-is-an-inventors-paradise-1476714981|title=Brooklyn’s New Lab Is an Inventor’s Paradise|last=Krause|first=Elliott|date=2016-10-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Formation of New Lab ==
[[David Belt]] and partner Scott Cohen formed the concept for New Lab in 2011 after prospecting the decaying Building 128 with Navy Yard president David Ehrenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/navy-yard-news/ny1-online-president-of-brooklyn-navy-yard-talks-changes/|title=NY1 Online: President of Brooklyn Navy Yard Talks Changes : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/about-bnydc/staff/|title=Executive Staff  : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners found the maritime manufacturing history of the structure, specifically the manufacturing innovations that took place there, synchronous with their aim to provide a platform for emerging hardware technologies in New York City. The city was abundant in resources and opportunities for entrepreneurs working in software, Belt said in a recent interview, but space, tools and resources for those working in the new manufacturing hardware community were lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belt leveraged his development firm, [[Macro Sea]], a company that specializes "in bringing historic properties back into cultural relevance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/vision/|title=Vision {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain funding, architectural expertise, and begin constructing a lease with the city of New York. The Navy Yard was in the initial stages of its current revitalization at the time and, because the city owned the property, special arrangements were needed to develop there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2016/09/the-plan-new-lab-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=The Plan: New Lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2016-09-22|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen began scouting the companies who would comprise their core members and helped work to capitalize them. To date, venture capitalists have invested approximately $250 million in New Lab and its members.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

== Historical Significance of Building 128 ==
[[File:USS Arizona in New York City Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieces of the USS Arizona were machined in Building 128. The ship is shown heading back to the yard after sea trials.]]

=== Lineage of the Site ===
The land predating New Lab has a rich historical cultural lineage and narrative of experimental and innovative breakthroughs. That past was a major factor in the decision to develop New Lab in the Navy Yard. Before colonial settlement, the area that would become the Navy Yard served as a clamming site for the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. It was then settled by the Dutch and sold to a developer, thus beginning its employment as a center for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thirteen.org|title=The City Concealed: Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2009-01-25|url=https://vimeo.com/2950807|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the technological advancements that took place at the Navy Yard are: the first use of the steam-powered pile driver; construction of the first undersea telegraph cable; development of a commercialized form of anesthetic ether by E.R. Squibb;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bhtVlobtuLUC&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=squibb+anaesthesia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UsRCsC_XZc&amp;sig=TttP5d2szQX1HdIGPcxvkgILURY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx8bGFn7LWAhUDxmMKHWFsCJ4Q6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=squibb%20anaesthesia&amp;f=false|title=Blessed Days of Anaesthesia: How anaesthetics changed the world|last=Snow|first=Stephanie J.|date=2009-09-10|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191622342|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a broadcast of the first woman to sing over the radio, opera singer Eugenia Farrar performed "I Love You Truly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/the-navy-yard/history/|title=History  : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of navy ships like the Fulton II, a first-of-its-kind steam-powered warship, and fabrication of the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS Arizona]], state-of-the-art among its peers, induced many influential manufacturing process refinements and advancements.

In interviews, Belt and Cohen both cite this maritime and technological history as inspiration for New Lab, both in guiding the renovation of the facility and in shaping its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ruki-founder-s-journal/newlab-cab35fee1172|title=Scott Cohen (New Lab) on why he is building a hardware hub in NYC|last=РУКИ|date=2017-03-17|website=Medium|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building 128 ===
According to a [[The Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation|Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation]] document,128 was raised in 1899 as a "steel structure... used to assemble large boiler engines and fabricated sections of naval vessels." It served as the primary machine shop for every major ship launched during World Wars One and Two. Designed to accommodate the significant height of a warship, the sequence of its hulking steel girders resembles an airport hangar. 128 has been slated for, but avoided, plans for non-naval readaptation. The City of New York sought to adapt it for reuse as a "food complex at one point," but the effort was not sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2007/12/brooklyn-navy-yard-building-128.html|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard: Building 128|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renovation and Architecture ===
[[File:New Lab Building128 Renovation.jpg|thumb|350px|left|August 31, 2015 photo of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 128 in the later stages of renovation for New Lab]]
Marvel Architects, New Lab's architect of record, along with DBI, Belt's project management firm, worked together to craft and execute the renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press regarding New Lab often states that the company occupies Building 128 of the Navy Yard, but this is slightly misleading in that 128 is a complex of warehouses and New Lab occupies the southernmost portion.

Recladding the building's armature and repurposing of the 51,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; machine shop into an 84,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; multidisciplinary design, prototyping, and advanced manufacturing space took approximately 5 years and continued until the company's full opening in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2016/06/new-lab-opens-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=New Lab opens in Brooklyn Navy Yard - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undertaking utilized approximately 9,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of steel in total according to the developer.&lt;ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/space/|title=Space {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A guiding principle of the redesign was to harmonize of the needs of the forthcoming lab environment with the original structural features. Modern workplace design elements were fused with the 19th century industrial characteristics of the building's centerline.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floor Plan ===
New Lab's open floor design was intended, spatially, to reinforce its mission, the layout meant to encourage member companies to collaborate and cross-pollinate ideas. Communal meeting rooms, office pods, and interior plazas on both floors emphasize the developer’s intention to create a collaborative design and fabrication center.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Upon completion, the rebuild subdivided Building 128's usable space into: Private studios = 31,664&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Open private studios = 6,226&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Fabrication lab = 6,834&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Cafe kitchen = 600&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Conference rooms = 2,014&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Coworking desks = 144; Flex space = 66 desks.&lt;ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab"/&gt;

There is an additional 6,174&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of event space which hosts talks, hackathons, and new manufacturing events such as the recent Urban Tech Hub launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/urban-tech-hub-launch-tickets-33215215604|title=Urban Tech Hub Launch|website=Eventbrite|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prototyping and Fabrication Lab ==
Additive Manufacturing (3D printing) technology is a component of the design process for many New Lab residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/design/the-daily/brooklyns-industrial-revolution|title=Brooklyn’s industrial revolution|date=2016-12-09|work=1843|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping shops are a distinguishing feature of the hardware-centric facility. New Lab leverages partnerships with firms like AutoDesk, Stratasys, BigRep, Haas, Ultimaker, and others to provide and maintain equipment and filament for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=auto+desk+newlab+brooklyb&amp;oq=auto+desk+newlab+brooklyb&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.8445j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=auto desk newlab brooklyb - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/224785/3d-printers-co-working-space/|title=3D Printers Open New Opportunities for Co-Working Space {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has amassed several million dollars of digital fabrication and manufacturing machine assets such as 3D Printers, electronic workbenches, fabrication tools, and CNC equipment since its opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies ==
As of September 2017 eighty companies and 400 people worked at New Lab.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt; By 2018, the number of companies had increased to over 100.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Members are typically growth-stage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyns-new-lab-is-an-inventors-paradise-1476714981|title=Brooklyn’s New Lab Is an Inventor’s Paradise|last=Krause|first=Elliott|date=2016-10-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; companies with anywhere between 3-20 employees.&lt;ref name="Lohr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/technology/new-york-startups-hardware-brooklyn.html|title=A Hardware Renaissance Grows in Brooklyn — and Elsewhere|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=2017-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online shaming''' is a form of [[Internet vigilantism]] in which targets are [[Public humiliation|publicly humiliated]] using technology like [[Social media|social]] and [[new media]]. Proponents of shaming see it as a form of [[online participation]] that allows [[hacktivism|hacktivists]] and [[cyber-dissident]]s to right injustices. Critics see it as a tool that encourages [[mob mentality|online mobs]] to destroy the reputation and careers of people or organizations who made perceived slights.

Online shaming frequently involves the publication of private information on the Internet (called [[doxing]]), which can frequently lead to hate messages and [[death threat]]s being used to intimidate that person. The ethics of public humiliation has been a source of debate over [[Internet privacy|privacy]] and [[Media ethics|ethics]].

==Public shaming==
[[File:Pillory 9105377.jpg|thumb|Jon Ronson has compared modern online shaming to medieval [[Pillory|pillories]].]]
The [[social networking]] tools of the Internet have been used as a tool to easily and widely publicize instances of perceived anti-social behavior.

David Furlow, chairman of the Media, Privacy and Defamation Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], has identified the potential privacy concerns raised by websites facilitating the distribution of information that is not part of the [[public record]] (documents filed with a government agency), and has said that such websites "just [give] a forum to people whose statements may not reflect truth."&lt;ref name="snitching redeye"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Swartz, RedEye |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-31/news/0705310470_1_unique-visitors-web-drivers |title=The wide world of cyber snitching |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some controversial incidents of public shaming, the popular link-sharing and discussion website [[Reddit]] introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public [[personally-identifying information]] via the site (colloquially known on Reddit and elsewhere as "[[doxing]]"{{clarify|date=December 2015}}). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

In 2015, online shaming was the subject of the book ''[[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]]'' by [[Jon Ronson]].&lt;ref name="onthemedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/story/jon-ronson-and-public-shaming/|title=Jon Ronson And Public Shaming|work=onthemedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronson documented how people had become [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] due to humiliation online for misinterpreted jokes, and says people should think twice before gleefully condemning someone for doing almost nothing wrong.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt;

==Types==

===Doxing===
{{main article|Doxing|cyber-stalking}}
Doxing involves researching and broadcasting [[personally identifiable information]] about an individual, often with the intention of harming that person.&lt;ref name=economistexplains&gt;{{cite news|last=S-W|first=C.|title=What doxxing is, and why it matters|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-9|publisher=The Economist, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodrich"&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Doxing?|publisher=TechNewsDaily.com|author=Ryan Goodrich|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/17590-what-is-doxing.html|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragan"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI’s warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zurcher|first=Anthony|title=Duke freshman reveals porn identity|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-echochambers-26477417|publisher=BBC, United Kingdom|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can often lead to [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[harassment]] and other forms of abuse. On February 1, 2017, Reddit, a social news website, has banned two [[alt-right]] communities, r/altright and r/alternativeright for doxing and violating Reddit community guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/reddit-bans-raltright-over-doxing/|title=Reddit bans r/altright over doxing|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=February 1, 2017|website=TechCrunch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/68000-reddit-bans-alt-right-subreddits-doxing.html|title=Reddit bans 'alt-right' subreddits for doxing|last=Schiesser|first=Tim|date=February 1, 2017|website=TechSpot|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14478948/reddit-alt-right-ban-altright-alternative-right-subreddits-doxing|title=Reddit bans two prominent alt-right subreddits|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=February 1, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge porn===
Nonconsensual pornography is a form of sexually explicit recording publicized on the Internet in order to humiliate a person, frequently distributed by [[hacker (term)|computer hackers]] or ex-partners (called [[revenge porn]]). Images and video of sexual acts are often combined with doxing of a person's private details, such as their home addresses and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bazelon,[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html Why Do We Tolerate Revenge Porn?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (Sept. 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Eric Larson, [http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/revenge-porn/ "It's Still Easy to Get Away With Revenge Porn"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[wikt:victim|Victims']] lives can be ruined as a result, the victims exposed to [[cyber-stalking]] and physical attack as well as facing difficulties in their workplace should their images become known as a result of routine checks by employers. Some have lost their jobs, while others have been unable to find work at all.&lt;ref name = Citron&gt;Danielle K. Citron, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/opinion/citron-revenge-porn/index.html "‘Revenge porn’ should be a crime"], ''CNN Opinion'' (Aug. 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reviews===
Products frequently attract negative reviews on [[Goodreads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/18/am-i-being-catfished-an-author-confronts-her-number-one-online-critic|title='Am I being catfished?'

In many cases, users of [[Yelp]] write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news|first=Max|last=Chafkin|newspaper=Inc.

In 2015 an [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)#Impact|Indiana pizzeria]] was swarmed with negative Yelp reviews after the owner said it wouldn't cater gay weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8327449/indiana-pizzeria-sb-101-yelp-reviews|title=Indiana pizzeria swarmed with negative Yelp reviews after saying it won't cater gay weddings|author=Colin Lecher|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/prnewser/anti-gay-indiana-pizza-place-earns-the-very-best-yelp-reviews/111872|title=Anti-Gay Indiana Pizza Place Earns the Very Best Yelp Reviews|work=adweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/indiana-religious-freedom-pizza-yelp-review-116572.html|title=Yelp reviewers rip Indiana pizza shop that endorsed 'religious freedom' law|author=Kendall Breitman|date=1 April 2015|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eater.com/2015/5/19/8588185/yelp-social-protest-trolling-memories-pizza|title=Why Yelp Emerged as a Site for Social Protest|author=amymckeever|work=Eater}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/01/this-anti-gay-pizza-place-got-trashed-on|title=This Anti-Gay Pizza Place Got Trashed on Yelp.

===Government shaming===
Various governments have used "name and shame" policies to punish tax evasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2015/08/17/govt-says-tax--name-and-shame--off-the-cards.html|title=Government Says Tax Name and Shame Off the Cards|date=2017|work=[[Sky News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-17/multinational-tax-avoiders-could-be-named-and-shamed/6701550|title=Leaked Senate report calls for ATO to name and shame multinational tax dodgers|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/bringing-back-black-money-name-shame-alone-wont-work-india-1762437.html|title=Bringing back black money: Why name-and-shame alone won't work in India|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental violations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1659235/green-groups-name-and-shame-chinas-publicly-listed-polluters|title=China's biggest polluting public companies named and shamed by green groups|date=9 December 2014|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minor crimes like littering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=April 23, 2015|title=Hong Kong's Name and Shame Litter Campaign|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/23/hong-kongs-name-and-shame-litter-campaign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

===Ashley Madison data breach===
{{main article|Ashley Madison data breach}}

In July 2015, a group hacked the user data of [[Ashley Madison]], a commercial dating website marketed as helping people have extramarital affairs. In August 2015, over 30 million user account details, including names and email addresses were released publicly.

A variety of security researchers and [[Internet privacy]] activists debated the ethics of the release.&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2015/08/notes-on-the-ashley-madison-hack|title=Early Notes on the Ashley Madison Hack|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/07/20/ashley-madison-ethics-journalism-hacked-documents/|title=In the wake of Ashley Madison, towards a journalism ethics of using hacked documents|work=Online Journalism Blog|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/19/ashley-madison-media/|title=Ashley Madison hack: The ethics of naming users |work=Fortune|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.includesecurity.com/2015/08/forensic-analysis-of-the-AshleyMadison-Hack.html|title=Include Security Blog – As the ROT13 turns….: A light-weight forensic analysis of the AshleyMadison Hack|author=Include Security|work=includesecurity.com|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Justine Sacco, a woman with 170 Twitter followers, tweeted acerbic jokes during a plane trip from New York to Cape Town, such as "Weird German dude get some deodorant"&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt; and, in [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]; "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just Kidding. I'm white!" Sacco, a South African herself,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; intended the tweet to mock American ignorance of South Africa, and in a later interview expressed that her intention was to "mimic—and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say."&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ronson, Jon|authorlink1=Jon Ronson|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choire|first1=Sicha|title=Jon Ronson's 'So You've Been Publicly Shamed'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/jon-ronsons-so-youve-been-publicly-shamed.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco slept during her 11-hour plane trip, and woke up to find out that she had lost her job and was the number one Twitter topic worldwide, with celebrities and [[new media]] bloggers all over the globe denouncing her and encouraging all their followers to do the same. Sacco's employer, New York internet firm [[IAC (company)|IAC]], declared that she had lost her job as Director of Corporate Communications.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015" /&gt; People began tweeting "Has Justine landed yet?", expressing [[schadenfreude]] at the loss of her career.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Sam Biddle]], the [[Gawker Media]] blogger who promoted the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag, later apologised for his role, admitting that he did so for Internet traffic to his blog,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; and noting that "it's easy and thrilling to hate a stranger online.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/journalist-apologizes-for--hasjustinelandedyet-twitter-uproar-after-pr-exec-s-aids-joke-164616178.html|title=Journalist apologizes for #HasJustineLandedYet Twitter uproar after PR exec's AIDS joke|date=20 December 2014|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/12/the-internet-rewards-the-meanest-people-most/|title=The Internet Rewards the Meanest People Most|author=Chris Thilk|work=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronson, the public does not understand that a vigilante campaign of public shaming, undertaken with the ostensible intention of defending the [[Underdog (term)|underdog]], may create a mob mentality capable of destroying the lives and careers of the public figures singled out for shaming.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Ronson argued that in the early days of Twitter, people used the platform to share intimate details of their lives, and not as a vehicle of [[Shame society|shaming]]. [[Brooke Gladstone]] argued that the Sacco affair may deter people from expressing themselves online due to a fear of being misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Kelly McBride argues that journalists play a key role in expanding the shame and humiliation of targets of the campaigns by relaying claims to a larger audience, while justifying their actions as simply documenting an event in an impartial manner.&lt;ref name=poyntersacco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/326097/journalism-and-public-shaming-some-guidelines/|title=Journalism and public shaming: Some guidelines|work=poynter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes: "Because of the mob mentality that accompanies public shaming events, often there is very little information about the target, sometimes only a single tweet. Yet there is a presumption of guilt and swift move toward justice, with no process for ascertaining facts." McBride further notes "If newspapers ran front-page photos of adulterers in the Middle East being stripped naked and whipped in order to further their shame, we would criticize them as part of a backward system of justice." Ben Adler compared the Sacco incident to a number of Twitter hoaxes, and argued that the media needs to be more careful to fact-check articles and evaluate context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/news_literacy/news_literacy_twitter.php|title=Trusting Twitter|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adria Richards incident====
In March 2013, at a [[Python Conference|PyCon]] technology conference, a female participant named Adria Richards took offense at a private discussion between two male attendees seated nearby using the words "[[dongle]]" and "[[Fork (software development)|forking]]" in reference to the male presenter, which she perceived as a sexual joke. Richards photographed the attendees with their faces visible, then published the photograph on Twitter including a shaming statement in her tweet. The following day, the employer of one of the photographed individuals, a software developer, terminated his employment because of the joke.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Guardian|title=The Internet Shaming of Lindsey Stone|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment to Hacker News article 'Inappropriate comments at pycon 2013 called out'|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Techie Adria Richards fired after tweeting about men's comments|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57575905/techie-adria-richards-fired-after-tweeting-about-mens-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Asking What Adria Richards Could Have Done Differently Is The Wrong Question|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/03/22/why-asking-what-adria-richards-could-have-done-differently-is-the-wrong-question/ | first=Deanna|last=Zandt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22863310/sendgrid-employees-tweet-sets-off-firestorm|title=SendGrid employee's tweet sets off firestorm|publisher=The Denver Post|first=Andy|last=Vuong|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Richards' public shaming of the developers, Internet users who were uninvolved launched a [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS Attack]] on her employer, [[SendGrid]], and according to an article by Jon Ronson in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' "told the employer the attacks would stop if Richards was fired".&lt;ref name="nytjonronson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|first=Jon|last=Ronson|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SendGrid subsequently terminated her employment later the same day citing Richards' dividing the very community she was hired to unite, and the male anatomy joke she had posted a few days earlier on the employer website. Following the incident, PyCon updated its attendee rules stating, "Public shaming can be counter-productive to building a strong community. PyCon does not condone nor participate in such actions out of respect."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytjonronson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How "dongle" jokes got two people fired—and led to DDoS attacks|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview, Richards—still unemployed—speculated whether the developer was responsible for instigating the Internet backlash against her.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt; The developer, who was offered a new job "right away", said he had not engaged with those who sent him messages of support, and had posted a short statement on [[Hacker News]] the same night after he was fired saying in part that Richards had "every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position".&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews" /&gt;

====The Kitten Killer of Hangzhou====

In 2006, Wang-Jue ({{zh|s=王珏|t=王玨|p=''Wáng-Jué'' |links=no}}), a Chinese nurse appearing in an Internet [[Crush film|crush video]] stomping a helpless kitten with her stilettos, gave herself up to authorities after bloggers and some print media started a campaign to trace back the recording.

Upon discovery of her identity, Wang Jue received death threats from many angry animal lovers.

Wang posted an apology on the [[Luobei]] city government official website. She said she was recently divorced and did not know what to do with her life.

In August 2010, a passer-by in [[Coventry]], [[England]], later identified as Mary Bale by [[4chan]]'s members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5622237/how-4chan-brought-the-evil-british-cat-lady-to-justice?skyline=true&amp;s=i|newspaper=[[Gawker]]|title=How 4chan Brought the Evil British Cat Bin Woman to Justice|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831034743/http://valleywag.gawker.com/5622237/how-4chan-brought-the-evil-british-cat-lady-to-justice?skyline=true&amp;s=i|archivedate=2010-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was caught on a private security camera stroking a cat, named Lola, then looking around and dumping her in a [[Wheelie bins|wheelie bin]], where she was found by her owners 15 hours later. The owners posted the video on the Internet in a bid to identify the woman, who was later interviewed by the [[RSPCA]] about her conduct. Outrage was sparked among animal lovers, and a Facebook group called "Death to Mary Bale" was created, and later removed. Police said they were speaking to the 45-year-old about her personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11087061|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|title=Woman who dumped cat in wheelie bin 'profoundly sorry'|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rabbit gate====

In 2010, a case was publicized involving a young female from [[Sichuan]], using the alias Huang siu siu (黄小小), torturing and crushing rabbits.  The group that financially sponsored the making of these videos, later revealed to be called "Crushfetish", paid young girls to crush fish, insects, rabbits and other small animals.  The girl was paid 100 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for each attempt, and she had been participating since 2007.  Police said the group makes videos to sell overseas, and the company has allegedly made 279 animal abuse videos with a subscription fee.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20101203-250663.html Rabbit-crushing woman confesses]."

====China's Watch Brother Incident====

On August 26, 2012, [[Yang Dacai]], chief of the Shanxi provincial work safety administration, was caught grinning widely amid the wreckage of a long-distance bus that killed 36 passengers when it collided with a tanker loaded with highly flammable methanol on a Chinese highway in [[Shanxi]] Province. Pictures of the accident began to circulate on [[Sina Weibo]], the most popular micro-blogging site in China which led to a meme dubbing him as the "Smiling Brother". Searches on the [[human flesh search engine]] followed leading to pictures surfacing on Weibo, showing Yang wearing luxury watches such as a $10,000 Rolex initiating another meme calling him "Watch Brother". On September 21, Yang was relieved of his position and accused of serious discipline violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Down ‘Watch Brother’: China’s Online Corruption-Busters Tread a Fine Line|publisher=Time World|url=http://world.time.com/2012/10/10/bringing-down-watch-brother-chinas-online-corruption-busters-tread-a-fine-line/#ixzz2QUeH7SHl | date=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of taking bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China 'smiling official' Yang Dacai jailed for 14 years|publisher=BBC|url=

====Dog Poop Girl====

In 2005 in South Korea, [[blog]]gers targeted a woman who refused to clean up when her dog [[defecation|defecated]] on the floor of a [[Seoul Subway Line 2|Seoul subway]] car, labeling her "Dog Poop Girl" (rough translation of {{lang-ko|"개똥녀"}} into English). Another commuter had taken a photograph of the woman and her dog, and posted it on a popular South Korean website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japundit.com/archives/2005/06/30/808/ |title=Puppy poo girl |publisher=Japundit.com |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915111805/http://japundit.com/archives/2005/06/30/808/ |archivedate=2008-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, she had been identified by Internet vigilantes, and much of her [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] was leaked onto the Internet in an attempt to punish her for the offense. The story received mainstream attention when it was widely reported in South Korean media. The public humiliation led the woman to drop out of her [[university]], according to reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070601953.html |title=Subway Fracas Escalates Into Test Of the Internet's Power to Shame |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2009-03-03 | first=Jonathan | last=Krim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction by the South Korean public to the incident prompted several newspapers in South Korea to run editorials voicing concern over Internet vigilantism. One paper quoted [[Daniel J. Solove|Daniel Solove]] as saying that the woman was the victim of a "cyber-posse, tracking down norm violators and branding them with digital [[The Scarlet Letter|Scarlet Letters]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2005/07/08/2005070861017.html |title="Trial by Internet" Casts Spotlight on Korean Cyber Mobs |publisher=Digital Chosunilbo : Daily News in English About Korea |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another called it an "Internet witch-hunt," and went on to say that "the Internet is turning the whole society into a [[kangaroo court]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=25576 |title= Internet Witch-hunts |publisher=AsiaMedia|date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=2009-03-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026005818/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=25576|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory====

In 2008, a 5-year-old girl asked to use the bathroom at the [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] at Bella Terra/Huntington Beach, but was disallowed from using it because the Factory's restrooms were for employees only.  The girl's mother describes the incident this way: "I explained she had diarrhea and couldn't hold it and told [the store owners] she was about to go on the floor. They refused again and never offered me any alternatives. I begged them to have a heart and that she was 5 but by that time she had lost it all over herself and me."&lt;ref name="Chasik"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://consumerist.com/2008/06/rocky-mountain-chocolate-factory-refuses-bathroom-access-to-5-year-old-who-then-has-diarrhea-in-fron.html|title=Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Refuses Bathroom Access to 5-Year-Old, Who Then Has Diarrhea In Front Of Them|last=Chasik|first=Alex|date=2008-06-24|publisher= consumerist.com|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story then spread to sites like digg.com where contact information for the owner of the store was released in message boards.

====Zhang Ya and Sichuan earthquake====

In 2008, a girl called Zhang Ya ({{lang-zh|s=张雅|t=張雅|p=Zhāng Yǎ|links=no}}) from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Northeast China]], posted a 4-minute video of herself complaining about the amount of attention the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] victims were receiving on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/23/content_8237906.htm|title=Where angles and devils meet – China's Internet in quake aftermath|last=Lin|first=Qiu|date=2008-05-23|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intense response from Internet vigilantes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suopei8.com/news/2008/0522/article_1477.html 关于辽宁女张雅辱骂灾区人民的违法行为讨论] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181624/http://www.suopei8.com/news/2008/0522/article_1477.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the girl's personal details&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cache.tianya.cn/publicforum/content/free/1/1261153.shtml|title=有个姑娘名叫张雅|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (even including her blood type) being made available online, as well as dozens of abusive video responses on Chinese websites and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qihoo.com/wenda.php?kw=%D5%C5%D1%C5&amp;do=search&amp;noq=q |script-title=zh:我帮你找到了张雅的资料，看看满意吗？ |publisher=Qihoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl was taken into police custody for three days as protection from vigilante death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kugz.net/thread-42994-1-1.html |script-title=zh:张雅 辽宁女 沈阳公安局证实:张雅被抓 |publisher=Kugz.net |date=2011-12-17 |accessdate=2012-03-12|language=zh|trans-title=Liaoning Public Security Bureau confirmed: Zhang Ya caught}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stephen Fowler and ''Wife Swap''====

Stephen Fowler, a [[UK|British]] [[expatriate]] and [[venture capitalist]] [[businessman]], gained notoriety after his performance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)|Wife Swap]]'' (originally aired Friday January 30, 2009) when his wife exchanged positions in his family with a woman from [[Missouri]] for a two-week period. In response to her rule changes (standard procedure for the second week in the show) he insulted his guest and, in doing so, groups including the lower classes, soldiers, and the overweight. Several websites were made in protest against his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/husbands-behaving-badly--120 |title=Husbands Behaving Badly - Yahoo! TV Blog |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show, and after watching the ''Wife Swap'' video, his wife, a professional [[life coach]], reported that she had encouraged him to attend professional behaviour counselling.  Businesses with only tangential connection to Fowler publicly disclaimed any association with him due to the negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/399231_theinsider09.html |title=The Insider: TV viewers stuff wrong inbox over 'Wife Swap' |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned positions on the boards of two environmental charities to avoid attracting negative press.

====Cyclist abuser incident====

In 2008, video of Patrick Pogan,  a rookie police officer, body-slamming Christopher Long, a cyclist, surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzRczBk06M |title=Officer Patrick Pogan |publisher=youtube.com |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The altercation happened when members of [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] conducted a bicycling advocacy event at [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7DC173CF93AA15754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;fta=y |title=Officer Investigated in Toppling of Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=James | last=Barron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officer claimed the cyclist had veered into him, and so the biker was charged with assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

The charges against the cyclist were later dropped and Pogan was convicted of lying about the confrontation with the cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/nyregion/30pogan.html |title=Ex-Officer Convicted of Lying About Confrontation With Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=John | last=Eligon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vigilante group targets mother====

In 2009, a Facebook group was started, accusing a single mother for the death of a 13-month-old child in her foster care. It was the mother's then common-law husband who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the mother was not formally accused of any wrongdoing. However, the members of the group, such as the boy's biological mother, accuse her of knowing what was going on and doing nothing to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/03/13/8733411-sun.html |title=Internet vigilante group torments mother |publisher=cnews.canoe.ca |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=Andrew | last=Hanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Cooks Source'' incident====

{{Main article|Cooks Source infringement controversy}}
The food magazine ''Cooks Source'' printed an article by Monica Gaudio without her permission in their October 2010 issue. Learning of the copyright violation, Gaudio emailed Judith Griggs, managing editor of ''Cooks Source Magazine'', requesting that the magazine both apologize and also donate $130 to the Columbia School of Journalism as payment for using her work. Instead she received a very unapologetic letter stating that she (Griggs) herself should be thanked for making the piece better and that Gaudio should be glad that she didn't give someone else credit for writing the article. During the ensuing public outcry, online vigilantes took it upon themselves to avenge Gaudio. The ''Cooks Source'' Facebook page was flooded with thousands of contemptuous comments, forcing the magazine's staff to create new pages in an attempt to escape the protest and accuse 'hackers' of taking control of the original page. The magazine's website was stripped of all content by the staff and shut down a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Rene|title=Cooks Source magazine vs. the Web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dailydish/2010/11/cooks-source-magazine-vs-the-web.html|accessdate=19 November 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullied bus monitor Karen Klein====

In June 2012, An elderly bus monitor, [[Bus monitor bullying video|Karen Klein]], was taunted, picked on, and threatened by four seventh-graders. The act was caught on video and uploaded to the Internet which in turn caused an act of kindness from complete strangers. $703,833  was raised for Klein in donations from concerned strangers who were outraged after viewing a video that captured her torment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bullied Bus Monitor Collects $703,833 Check|url = http://www.inquisitr.com/330131/bullied-bus-monitor-receives-another-700000/|website = The Inquisitr News|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senior solicitor, Alexander Carter-Silk and junior barrister, Charlotte Proudman====

In 2015 a junior barrister Charlotte Proudman working in the UK [[Twitter#Tweets|tweeted]] a screenshot of her [[LinkedIn]] exchange with Alexander Carter-Silk, a senior City solicitor, rebuking him for complimenting her on her profile photograph. The social media backlash included Proudman finding herself condemned as a "[[feminazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Caroline | title = Stories of 2015: the barrister branded a 'feminazi' in LinkedIn sexism row | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/charlotte-proudman-feminazi-barrister-linkedin-sexism-row | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 29 December 2015 | access-date = 16 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products.

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10065">'''Posthumanization''' comprises "those processes by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological [[Human|human beings]] who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the [[society]]."&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018 def"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sapient Circuits and Digitalized Flesh: The Organization as Locus of Technological Posthumanization|edition=second|last1=Gladden|first1=Matthew|date=2018|url = http://www.matthewgladden.net/wp-content/uploads/Sapient-Circuits-and-Digitalized-Flesh-2e-M-Gladden-2018.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Defragmenter Media|isbn=978-1-944373-21-4|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=19|accessdate=March 14, 2018}} Elsewhere (p. 35) in the same text Gladden proposes a longer definition, stating that "The processes of posthumanization are those dynamics by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, activities, or meaning of the society. In this way, a society comes to incorporate a diverse range of intelligent human, non-human, and para-human social actors who seek to perceive, interpret, and influence their shared environment and who create knowledge and meaning through their networks and interactions."&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumanization is one of the key phenomena studied by those academic disciplines and methodologies that identify themselves as "posthumanist", including critical, cultural, and philosophical [[posthumanism]]. Its processes can be divided into forms of ''non-technological'' and ''technological'' posthumanization.&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013 two forms"&gt;{{cite book|title=Posthumanism: A Critical Analysis|last1=Herbrechter|first1=Stefan|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-7809-3690-1|location=London}}After referring (p. 3) to "the current technology-centred discussion about the potential transformation of humans into something else (a process that might be called 'posthumanization')," Herbrechter offers an analysis of Lyotard's essay "A Postmodern Fable," in which Herbrechter concludes (p. 7) that "What Lyotard's sequel to Nietzsche's fable shows is that, on the one hand, there is no point in denying the ongoing technologization of the human species, and, on the other hand, that a purely technology-centred idea of posthumanization is not enough to escape the humanist paradigm."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sapient Circuits and Digitalized Flesh: The Organization as Locus of Technological Posthumanization|edition=second|last1=Gladden|first1=Matthew|date=2018|url = http://www.matthewgladden.net/wp-content/uploads/Sapient-Circuits-and-Digitalized-Flesh-2e-M-Gladden-2018.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Defragmenter Media|isbn=978-1-944373-21-4|location=Indianapolis, IN|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological vs. non-technological posthumanization ==

=== Non-technological posthumanization ===
While posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s;&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ferrando|first = Francesca|title = Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations|journal = Existenz: An International Journal in Philosophy, Religion, Politics, and the Arts|volume = 8|issue = 2|date = 2013|pages=26-32|url=https://existenz.us/volumes/Vol.8-2Ferrando.pdf|issn = 1932-1066|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of ''non-technological'' posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as [[Pet|household pets]] or in which [[ghosts]], [[Monster|monsters]], [[Angel|angels]], or semidivine [[Greek hero cult|heroes]] were considered to play some role in the world.&lt;ref name="Graham 2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Representations of the Post/Human: Monsters, Aliens and Others in Popular Culture|last1=Graham|first1=Elaine|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-8135-3058-X|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=Posthumanism: A Critical Analysis|last1=Herbrechter|first1=Stefan|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-7809-3690-1|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018" /&gt;

Such non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of [[Temple|temples]], [[Cemetery|cemeteries]], [[Zoo|zoos]], or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society,&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gladden 2018" /&gt; to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: "the notion of [[spirituality]] dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence." &lt;ref Name="Ferrando 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferrando | first = Francesca | editors = Banerji, D. | title = Critical Posthumanism and Planetary Futures | edition = 1st| publisher = Springer  | location = New York | isbn = 9788132236375 | year = 2016 | pages = 243–256 | chapter = Humans Have Always Been Posthuman: A Spiritual Genealogy of the Posthuman | chapterurl = https://www.academia.edu/31138169/HUMANS_HAVE_ALWAYS_BEEN_POSTHUMAN_A_SPIRITUAL_GENEALOGY_OF_POSTHUMANISM |  accessdate=2018-08-08 | display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological posthumanization ===
Some forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to [[genetic engineering]] or [[Neuroprosthetics|neurocybernetic augmentation]]; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by [[Cyborg|cyborg theory]].&lt;ref name="Gray 1995"&gt;''The Cyborg Handbook'' (1995). Chris Hables Gray, editor. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|9780415908498}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly "posthumanize" human society through the deployment of [[Social robot|social robots]] or attempts to develop [[Artificial general intelligence|artificial general intelligences]], [[Cognitive robotics|sentient networks]], or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies.

The dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of [[science fiction]]; genres such as [[cyberpunk]] take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] future for humanity,&lt;ref name="Moravec 1988"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence|last1=Moravec|first1=Hans|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-57618-7|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|date=2005|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101218884|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|title=Medical Enhancement and Posthumanity|chapter=Why I Want to Be a Posthuman When I Grow Up|chapterurl=https://nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf|format=pdf|year=2008|editor1-last=Gordijn|editor1-first=Bert|editor2-last=Chadwick|editor2-first=Ruth|pages=107-137|publisher=Springer Netherlands|ISBN=978-1-4020-8851-3|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[Bioconservatism|bioconservative]] critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology.&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last1=Fukuyama|first1=Francis|date=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|isbn=9781861972972|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of technological and non-technological posthumanization ==
Processes of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial "de-[[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentrization]]" of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple [[Binary opposition|binaries]], such as those of "human versus non-human", "natural versus artificial", "alive versus non-alive", and "biological versus mechanical".&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2013 non-dualistic"&gt;Ferrando, Francesca (2013). "Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations." ''Existenz: An International Journal in Philosophy, Religion, Politics, and the Arts'' 8 (2): 26-32. ISSN 1932-1066. Ferrando notes (p. 27) that such challenging of binaries constitutes part of "the post-anthropocentric and post-dualistic approach of (philosophical, cultural, and critical) posthumanism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbrechter 2013" /&gt;

'''Real-time transcription''' is the general term for [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] by [[court reporters]] using [[real-time text]] technologies to deliver computer text screens within a few seconds of the words being spoken. Specialist software allows participants in [[court hearings]] or [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] to make notes in the text and highlight portions for future reference.

Typically, real-time writers can produce text using  machines at the rate of at least 200 [[words per minute]].  Stenographers can typically type up to 300 words per minute for short periods of time, but most cannot sustain such a speed.

Real-time transcription is also used in the [[broadcasting]] environment where it is more commonly termed "captioning."

== Career opportunities ==

Real-time reporting is used in a variety of industries, including entertainment, television, the Internet, and law.

Specific careers include the following:

* Judicial reporters use a stenotype to provide instant transcripts on computer screens as a trial or deposition occurs.
* [[Communication access real-time translation]] (CART) reporters assist the hearing-impaired by transcribing spoken words, giving them personal access to the communications they need day to day.
* Television broadcast captioners use real-time reporting technology to allow hard-of-hearing or deaf people to see what is being said on live television broadcasts such as news, emergency broadcasts, sporting events, awards shows, and other programs.
* Internet information (or Webcast) reporters provide real-time reporting of sales meetings, press conferences, and other events, while simultaneously transmitting the transcripts to computers worldwide.
* Other rapid data entry positions.

Claims of "near-room temperature" transient effects date from the early 1950s and some suggest that in fact the breakthrough might have been made more than once but could not be made stable enough and/or reproducible as the relationship between isotope number and T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; was not known at the time.

==Reports==
Since the discovery of [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, several materials have been reported to be room-temperature [[superconductor]]s, although none of these reports has been confirmed.

In 2000, while extracting electrons from [[diamond]] during [[ion implantation]] work, Johan Prins claimed to have observed a phenomenon that he explained as room-temperature superconductivity within a [[Phase (matter)|phase]] formed on the surface of oxygen-doped type [[Diamond|IIa diamonds]] in a [[Vacuum|{{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mbar}} vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2015, an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by researchers of the Max Planck Institute suggested that under certain conditions such as extreme pressure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S transitioned to a superconductive form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S at around 1.5 million times atmospheric pressure in a [[diamond anvil cell]]. The critical temperature is 203&amp;nbsp;K which would be the highest T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ever recorded and their research suggests that other hydrogen compounds could superconduct at up to 260&amp;nbsp;K which would match up with the original research of Ashcroft.&lt;ref name=cart15/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeZhangYao2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ge|first1=Y.

In 2018, Dev Kumar Thapa and Anshu Pandey from the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore claimed the observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure and room temperature in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded in a gold matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for Superconductivity at Ambient Temperature and Pressure in Nanostructures|first=Dev Kumar |last=Thapa |first2=Anshu |last2=Pandey |arxiv = 1807.08572 |bibcode = 2018arXiv180708572T |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Due to similar noise patterns of supposedly independent plots and the not peer-reviewed nature of this publication, the results were called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iisc-duos-claim-of-ambient-superconductivity-may-have-support-in-theory/article24725793.ece?homepage=true |title=IISc duo's claim of ambient superconductivity may have support in theory |last=Desikan |first=Shubashree |date=2018-08-18 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, researchers noted a possible superconducting phase at 260K in lanthanum decahydride at elevated (200GPa) pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Grant |doi=10.1063/PT.6.1.20180823b |title= Pressurized superconductors approach room-temperature realm |journal = Physics Today |date= 2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research also suggests a link between the palladium hydride containing small impurities of sulfur as a plausible explanation for the anomalous resistance drops noticed by other researchers, and hydrogen absorption by cuprates has been suggested in light of the recent results in [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] as a plausible explanation for transient resistance drops or "USO" noticed
in the 1990s during research after the discovery of YBCO.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

==Theories==
Theoretical work by [[Neil Ashcroft]] predicted that solid [[metallic hydrogen]] at extremely high pressure (~500&amp;nbsp;GPa) should become superconducting at approximately room-temperature because of its extremely high [[speed of sound]] and expected strong [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the conduction electrons and the lattice vibrations ([[phonon]]s).&lt;ref name=Ashc1968&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author = Ashcroft, N. W. 
 |title = Metallic Hydrogen: A High-Temperature Superconductor?

|bibcode = 1968PhRvL..21.1748A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction is yet to be experimentally verified, as yet the pressure to achieve metallic hydrogen is not known but may be of the order of 500&amp;nbsp;GPa.

A team at Harvard has claimed to make metallic hydrogen and reports a pressure of 495&amp;nbsp;GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hydrogen-metal-revolution-technology-space-rockets-superconductor-harvard-university-a7548221.html | title=Hydrogen turned into metal in stunning act of alchemy that could revolutionise technology and spaceflight |work=[[The Independent]] |language=en-UK |author=Ian Johnston |date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the exact critical temperature has not yet been determined, weak signs of a Meissner effect at 250K may have appeared in magnetometer tests.

In 1964, William A. Little proposed the possibility of high temperature superconductivity in [[organic polymers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author = Little, W. A.

SEVEN [[mobile messaging]] products are [[turnkey]] multi-device, multi-service [[computer software]] for operators and device manufacturers. The company claims its products have a desktop-like experience for core messaging applications like [[email]], [[instant messaging]]s and [[social networking]].

==History==

The company was formerly known as Leap Corporation and changed its name to SEVEN Networks, Inc. in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Company Overview of SEVEN Networks, Inc. |work= Business Week web site |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=715608 |accessdate= June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2004 the company was selected for FierceWireless' list of 15 promising and innovative wireless startups of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/special-reports/seven Fiercewireless], retrieved 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2005, CEO [[Bill Nguyen]] had left to start another company.&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Bill Nguyen: The Boy in the Bubble |date= October 19, 2011 |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1784823/bill-nguyen-boy-bubble |work= Fast Company |accessdate= June 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, the company announced [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] as a customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=2916 Mobileburn], retrieved 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the company expanded its products to support email services, added mobile instant messaging applications, analytics and [[social networking]].
In 2010, the company announced it was selected by [[Samsung Electronics]] to provide [[push technology]] for Samsung Social Hub, a social networking and integrated messaging  service available on several of the company’s handsets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2010/SEVENSignsGlobalAgreementwithSamsungElectronicstoPowerIntegratedMessagingandSocialNetworkingonMobileDevices.php SEVEN Press Release], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the company claimed in a press release to have more than eight million accounts  actively synchronized on mobile devices using its software.&lt;ref name="ww"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2010/SEVENReportsaFullYearofProfitabilityasCompanysUserBaseContinuestoGrowFasterthanMarket.html Seven Press Release], retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, the company announced [[Verizon Wireless]] as a customer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/press-releases/verizon-wireless-expands-push-services-using-seven-networks-technology FierceWireless], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and also announced Open Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=203580 Light Reading Mobile], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Channel==

The Open Channel software product line focuses on mobile traffic management and optimization. There are Open Channel products for wireless signaling optimization, carrier network policy enforcement, and [[mobile data offloading]].&lt;ref name="RCR Wireless"&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20130226/networks/mwc-2013-getting-handle-network-intelligence/ RCR Wireless], retrieved 04 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Open Channel was launched in February 2011 to help carriers manage the impact of [[push technology]] for message notifications on their networks. It works by monitoring all requests for data from [[smartphone]] applications, such as [[Facebook]], [[email]], [[Twitter]], which make up to hundreds of requests per hour, with only a small fraction of them actually returning data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20110125/ENABLERAPPS/110129977/seven-networks-optimization-tool-reduces-data-traffic-improves RCR Wireless News], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform acts as a buffer in the network, determining when content for a particular app is available and then allowing the phone to get that content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectedplanetonline.com/3g4g/news/MWC-Network-optimization-gets-specific-0131/index.html Connected Planet Online], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;   Early tests estimated [[mobile devices]] might reduce their time on a network by up to 40 percent and mobile traffic by up to 70 percent while boosting battery life by up to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2011/01/25/in-smartphones-seven-finds-a-new-heaven/ GigaOM], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Channel is transparent to connected applications and requires no changes or special integration by mobile developers. Additionally, it does not require changes to the network and can work in conjunction with new standards for fast network dormancy, smart signaling and other network optimizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intomobile.com/2011/01/28/seven-open-channel/ IntoMobile], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Open Channel received the [[GSMA]] Global Mobile Award for Best Mobile Technology Breakthrough in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/2011/6034.htm GSM World], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Open Channel added offerings for policy enforcement and offloading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/seven-provide-signaling-optimization-north-american-carrier/2013-02-25 FierceBroadbandWireless], retrieved 04 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Also in early 2013, Toronto-based wireless operator Public Mobile selected Open Channel to manage network signaling and help reduce service costs stemming from non-optimized mobile applications and unnecessary data traffic that was creating excess network congestion.&lt;ref name="RCR Wireless"/&gt;

In September 2015, Open Channel was made available directly to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seven.com/2015/02/09/open-channel-for-everyone/ SEVEN Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile Messaging==

The System SEVEN software allows consumers and enterprises to access information, such as business and personal email, calendar, corporate directories, personal contacts, and documents, as well as allows users to deliver mobile data, applications, and services to a portfolio of devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seven Crunchbase], retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; SEVEN's push notification platform, System SEVEN, is deployed as a [[SaaS]]  (software-as a service) solution. SEVEN Mobile Email&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobilityarena.com/system-seven-an-efficient-push-email-solution/ Mobility Arena], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and SEVEN Mobile IM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2009/SEVENAddsIMtoItsPush-enabledMobileMessagingPortfolio.php SEVEN Press Release], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; are SEVEN's own applications built on top of its push platform and its Ping Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://androinica.com/2012/01/seven-launches-ping-the-ultimate-free-push-based-social-messaging-app-for-android/ Androinica], retrieved 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; allow operators and device manufacturers to use the SEVEN push notification technology for messaging services and mobile applications. They provide mobile operators and device manufacturers with a solution for integrated messaging services.

System SEVEN mobile email is a server-assisted solution, where access to user's email account appears to originate from IP addresses hosted by SEVEN (208.87.200.0 - 208.87.207.255)&lt;ref&gt;[http://whois.arin.net/rest/net/NET-208-87-200-0-1/pft ARIN Online], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; or its customers. Although done with user's permission, email service providers may flag these as potential hacking attempts and have raised security concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ip-address-lookup-v4.com/ip/208.87.200.187 IP Address Lookup], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; most recently with Microsoft Outlook for Android and iOS&lt;ref&gt;[http://exchangeserverpro.com/outlook-for-ios-and-android/ Exchangeserverpro], retrieved 31 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Industrial Revolution''', also known as the '''Technological Revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muntone|first=Stephanie|title=Second Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|work=Education.com|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224325/http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The [[First Industrial Revolution]], which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in [[manufacturing]], such as the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, the development of methods for manufacturing [[interchangeable parts]] and the invention of the [[Bessemer Process]] to produce [[steel]], the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the start of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistoryscene.com/article/second-industrial-revolution/ The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870-1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] and [[railroad]] networks, gas and [[water supply]], and [[sewage systems]], which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of [[globalization]]. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly [[electrical power]] and [[telephone]]s. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory [[electrification]] and the [[production line]], and ended at the start of [[World War I]].

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], but also in [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. It followed on from the [[First Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. It was characterized by the build out of [[railroad]]s, large-scale iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], use of [[petroleum]] and the beginning of [[electrification]].  It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by [[Patrick Geddes]], ''[[Patrick Geddes#Published works|Cities in Evolution]]'' (1910), but [[David Landes]]' use of the term in a 1966 essay and in ''[[The Unbound Prometheus]]'' (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] (1918–2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use.&lt;ref&gt;James Hull, "The Second Industrial Revolution: The History of a Concept", ''Storia Della Storiografia,'' 1999, Issue 36, pp 81–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Landes (2003) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially, the [[internal combustion engine]] and petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], electricity and communication technologies (such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and [[radio]]).

Vaclav Smil called the period 1867–1914 "The Age of [[Synergy]]" during which most of the great innovations were developed since the inventions and innovations were engineering and [[Applied science|science-based]].&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil  |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-516874-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.  Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads.  Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives.  This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron ===
The [[hot blast]] technique, in which the hot [[flue gas]] from a blast furnace is used to [[air preheater|preheat]] combustion air blown into a [[blast furnace]], was invented and patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828 at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first=David.  S.|authorlink=David Landes|year=1969|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-09418-6|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling costs for producing [[wrought iron]] coincided with the emergence of the [[railway]] in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. [[Edward Alfred Cowper]] developed the Cowper stove in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=256–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Steel ===
[[File:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Bessemer converter]]. Air blown through holes in the converter bottom creates a violent reaction in the molten pig iron that oxidizes the excess carbon, converting the pig iron to pure iron or steel, depending on the residual carbon.]]

The [[Bessemer process]], invented by [[Sir Henry Bessemer]], allowed the [[mass-production]] of [[steel]], increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from [[pig iron]] by [[oxidation]] with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The "acid" Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce [[hematite]] ore&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is low in phosphorus. [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the [[phosphorus]] from [[iron]]. Collaborating with his cousin, [[Percy Gilchrist]] a chemist at the [[Blaenavon Ironworks]], [[Wales]], he patented his process in 1878;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-GIL-1850.html ''Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist'' at Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolckow Vaughan]] &amp; Co. in [[Yorkshire]] was the first company to use his patented process.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist |volume=26 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom/&gt;

[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] operated 18 Bessemer converters and owned the largest steelworks in the world at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The next great advance in steel making was the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer [[Pierre-Émile Martin]] was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens-Martin process complemented rather than replaced the [[Bessemer process]].  Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, [[skyscraper]]s, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were [[steel cable]], steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s and naval ships.

=== Rail ===
[[File:The rail rolling mill, Hughesovka.jpg|thumb|300px|A rail rolling mill in [[Donetsk]], 1887.]]
The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that [[railroad]]s could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. [[Wrought iron]] was soft and contained flaws caused by included [[dross]].  Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and was damaged by [[hammer blow]]. The first to make durable [[rail profile|rails]] of steel rather than [[wrought iron]] was [[Robert Forester Mushet]] at the [[Darkhill Ironworks]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1857.

The first of his steel rails was sent to [[Derby Midland railway station]].  They were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolt |first1=L.T.C |title=Victorian Engineering |year=1974 |origyear= |publisher=Pelican |location=London |isbn=  |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of [[railways|rail transportation]] throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.  Steel rails lasted over ten times longer than did iron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0801811481 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the falling cost of steel, heavier weight rails were used.  This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first=Nathan|authorlink=|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-27367-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grubler|first1=Arnulf|author1-link=|title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures|year=1990|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrification ===
{{Main|Electrification|Electricity}}
The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist [[Michael Faraday]]. Through his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]], Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Faraday, Michael |volume=10 |page=173 |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004417/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.

[[File:Light bulb Edison 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|U.S. Patent#223898: Electric-Lamp. Issued January 27, 1880.]]

In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the first feasible [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', October 3, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRE&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', December 29, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the first electrical street lighting installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|title=Sir Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=home.frognet.net|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005841/http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Chemsoc/Activities/ChemicalLandmarks/UK/JosephSwan.asp |title=Sir Joseph Swan, The Literary &amp; Philosophical Society of Newcastle |date=3 February 2009 |publisher=rsc.org |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home. The first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London in 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/how/electricity/electricity_07.asp |title=History of public supply in the UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201194910/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/how/electricity/electricity_07.asp |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later at [[Pearl Street Station]] in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Hunter|Bryant|1991|p=191}}

Each wire carries current 120 degrees apart in phase. Arrows show the resulting magnetic force vectors. Three phase current is used in commerce and industry.]]

The first modern power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]] at [[Deptford]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) [[alternating current]], it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage [[AC power]] that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. [[Electrification]] allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the [[assembly line]] and [[mass production]].&lt;ref name ="Ford1922"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Henry|author1-link=Henry Ford|author2=Crowther, Samuel |title=My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford|year=1922|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]] was called "the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives |last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2988 }} (Viewable on line)&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric [[tram|street railways]] were either using his equipment or in planning.  The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920.  The AC ([[Induction motor]]) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the [[electrification#History of electrification|electrification]] of industry.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink=  |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= |pages=14, 15 |url= |location= Cambridge, MA; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. [[Fluorescent light]]ing was commercially introduced at the [[1939 World's Fair]].

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of [[Electrochemistry#19th century|electro-chemicals]], such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine tools ===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|A graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts.]]

The use of [[machine tool]]s began with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution|First Industrial Revolution]]. The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in [[James Watt]]'s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to [[Henry Maudslay]] and refined by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became the world's first national machine tool standard called [[British Standard Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9–10.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of [[machine tools]] to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last=Ford |first=Henry |authorlink= |author2=Crowther, Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |isbn= |pages=30 |url= |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper making ===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The first paper making machine was the [[Fourdrinier machine]], built by Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers in [[London]]. In 1800, [[Matthias Koops]], working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000'', Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}. pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1840s,  that [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in [[Saxony]] both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper. This started a new era for [[History of paper|paper making]],&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the invention of the [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The [[petroleum industry#History|petroleum industry]], both production and [[Petroleum refinery|refining]], began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] set up a small business refining the crude oil in 1848.

[[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|Cable tool drilling]] was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells.  The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine.  Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first "modern oil well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC&amp;pg=PA13 M.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil.  Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the [[gas mantle]]. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. [[Gasoline]] was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the [[Burton process]] for [[cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.&lt;ref name = Yergin/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1881]]
[[Synthetic dye]] was discovered by English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin's accidental discovery was that [[aniline]] could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new "[[mauveine]]", and commercialized it as the world's first synthetic dye.&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.
Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The launch of [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], which was advanced for her time, 1843.|alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags]]
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]] was introduced in 1835 by [[Francis Pettit Smith]] who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |title=History and Design of Propellers: Part 1 |publisher=the boatbuilding.community |accessdate=2007-09-03 |date=2004-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811200813/http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith's [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and the paddle steamer {{HMS|Alecto|1839|6}}; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by [[Horseley Ironworks]] and named the ''[[Aaron Manby]]''. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]''&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan (2006), pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref name="Beckett 2006, pp. 171–173"&gt;Beckett (2006), pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumpleton and Miller (2002), pp. 34–46&lt;/ref&gt; built by engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[keel]] and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H (2003). ''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''. [[Oxford University Press]] (US). {{ISBN|978-0-19-516731-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel's vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion steam engines]] began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt; [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|The oscillating engine]] was first built by [[Aaron Manby (ironmaster)|Aaron Manby]] and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term ''oscillating''.

It was [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]], engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the [[grasshopper beam engine]]. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the [[Admiralty]] yacht, {{HMS|Black Eagle}} with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay, Son &amp; Field]]. Penn also introduced the [[marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. {{HMS|Encounter|1846|6}} (1846) and {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}} (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.&lt;ref&gt;Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103–116 &amp; Preston, A., &amp; Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern [[battleship]]s in the 1870s, evolved from the [[ironclad]] design of the 1860s. The [[Devastation-class ironclad|''Devastation''-class]] [[turret ship]]s were built for the British [[Royal Navy]] as the first class of ocean-going [[capital ship]] that did not carry [[sail]]s, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The [[vulcanization]] of [[rubber]], by American [[Charles Goodyear]] and Englishman [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of [[Tyres|rubber tyre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245 |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling - William Hume, 1938.

&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop's development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]] and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer [[Harry John Lawson]] in 1876, although it was [[John Kemp Starley]] who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1880-1939/IC.025/|title=Icons of Invention: Rover safety bicycle, 1885|publisher=The Science Museum.|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity soon grew, causing the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the [[Macadam]] method pioneered by Scottish engineer [[John Loudon McAdam]], and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile===
German inventor [[Karl Benz]] patented the world's [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|first automobile]] in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition &lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

[[Henry Ford]] built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford's vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with [[machine tools]] and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the [[assembly line]], the complete process being called [[mass production]]. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year.&lt;ref name ="Ford1922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; The savings from [[mass production]] methods allowed the price of the [[Model T]] to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied science===
[[Applied science]] opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of [[thermodynamics]] and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of [[physical chemistry]]. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of [[metallurgy]] was advanced through the work of [[Henry Clifton Sorby]] and others. Sorby pioneered the study of [[iron]] and [[steel]] under [[microscope]], which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Henry Clifton Sorby|url=http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211758/http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for [[Henry Bessemer]] and [[Robert Forester Mushet]] to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[nickel]] which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. [[Vanadium steel]], for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (2006) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s.  Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery.  Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the "father of the fertilizer industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] which produced the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] [[meat extract]]. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], introduced modern conventions for [[molecular modeling]] and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of [[thermodynamics]] was developed into its modern form by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]]. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and [[steam turbine]]s. The work of [[Michael Faraday]] and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of [[electricity]].

Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was particularly influential—his discoveries ushered in the era of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Knots_and_physics.html |title=Topology and Scottish mathematical physics |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that described [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] as manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]], namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]] and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell himself developed the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270–283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr | title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424–444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control theory is the basis for [[process control]], which is widely used in [[automation]], particularly for [[process industries]], and for controlling ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800–1930 |last=Benett|first= Stuart|authorlink=|year=1986|publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology

These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by [[James Watt]].  Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders.  However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory.  The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
[[Justus von Liebig]] was the first to understand the importance of [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]], and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to [[plant nutrition]]. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating [[phosphate of lime]] in bone meal with [[sulfuric acid]]. Another pioneer was [[John Bennet Lawes]] who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet |volume=16 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Coprolite#Coprolite mining|coprolites]] in commercial quantities in [[East Anglia]], led Fisons and [[Edward Packard (businessman, born 1819)|Edward Packard]] to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at [[Bramford]], and [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in the 1850s. By the 1870s [[superphosphate]]s produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html History of Fisons at Yara.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50172&amp;back=|title=Oxford DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] along with his business partner [[Sam Eyde]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Aaron John Ihde|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon replaced by the much more efficient [[Haber process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950|author1=Trevor Illtyd Williams|author2=Thomas Kingston Derry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0198581599|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by the [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemists [[Carl Bosch]] of [[IG Farben]] and [[Fritz Haber]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/haberbosch.html Haber &amp; Bosch ''Most influential persons of the 20th century''], by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;/ref&gt; The process utilized molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of [[nitric acid]].

===Engines and turbines===
The [[steam turbine]] was developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] in 1884. His first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152751/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized [[Turbinia|marine transport and naval warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used [[internal combustion engine]] was the [[Otto engine|Otto type]] of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt; The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today's common gasoline engine.

The [[diesel engine]] was independently designed by [[Rudolf Diesel]] and [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world's most efficient prime mover.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

===Telecommunications===
[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|thumb|400px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]
The first commercial [[telegraph]] system was installed by Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] in May 1837 between [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EKr7FUkw?url=http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first [[undersea cable]] being built by [[John Watkins Brett]] between [[France]] and [[England]].
The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean.

The [[telephone]] was patented in 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John, ''Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications''  (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory]]. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. [[David Edward Hughes]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

It was Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amit|last=Roy|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/nation/story_10221833.jsp|work=The Telegraph|location=[[Kolkota]]|title=Cambridge 'pioneer' honour for Bose|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year transmitted [[Morse code]] across [[Salisbury Plain]], sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea&lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070120163444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]] to [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key development of the [[vacuum tube]] by Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. [[Lee De Forest]]'s subsequent invention of the [[triode]] allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern [[business enterprise]] by scholars such as Alfred Chandler.  Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement.  Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough.  A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather.    A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform.  This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority.  When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines  along the railroads to keep track of trains.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous.  Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs.  For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight.  They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time.  This led to what was called "railroad accounting", which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last= Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred |date= 1993 |title= The Visible Hand|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 115 |isbn= 0674417682 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAI3AwAAQBAJ | access-date = 2017-06-29 | quote = [...] American railroad accounting overstated operating costs and understated capital consumption.[...] The basic innovations in financial and capital accounting appeared in the 1850s in response to specific needs and were perfected in the years after the Civil War.

&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and others in America developed the concept of [[scientific management]] or [[Taylorism]]. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as [[time and motion study|time-and-motion studies]], but the concepts evolved into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], and [[business management]] that helped to completely restructure{{cn|date=June 2017}} the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor's core principles included:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task"
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==
The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)|productivity]].  This caused [[unemployment]] and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a century -or during the present generation of living men- have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world's history".&lt;ref name ="Wells1890"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from [[public health]] initiatives, such as the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies—(the [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power.  Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ayres|last2=Warr|first1=Robert U.|first2 = Benjamin|author1-link =|title=Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work|year=2004|url=http://www.iea.org/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in steam efficiency, like [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade.  Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the [[Jevons paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships.  This, plus the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods.  This led to many business failures and periods that were called ''depressions'' that occurred as the world economy actually grew.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;  See also: [[Long depression]]

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the [[Low Countries]]) in the 1830s and '40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% percent and the vast majority of the British population was [[urbanization|urbanized]]. This milestone was reached by the [[Low Countries]] and the US in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Grigg|title=Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline|journal=|jstor=40572192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in [[free trade]] throughout this period.  The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 149, based on Paul Bairoch, "International Industrialization Levels from 1750 to 1980," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1982) v. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life.  They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII.  Only a few major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, [[combustion turbine]]s (jet engines) and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives|last=Constable|first=George|authorlink=|author2=Somerville, Bob|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08908-5|pages=|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/id=2988}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}This link is to entire on line book.&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

==United Kingdom==

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with [[mass production]] techniques (after 1910) greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &amp;mdash; and falling &amp;mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vatter | last2 = Walker| last3 =Alperovitz| first1 = Harold G.| first2 = John F.| first3 =Gar| author1-link =| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910–1990, Journal of Economic Issues| date = June 1995| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5437/is_n2_v29/ai_n28658086/| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century.  The [[Gilded Age]] in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and [[coal mining]].  The iconic event was the opening of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation's financial market in [[Wall Street]]. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry&amp;mdash;a few large corporations, some organized as "trusts" (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the [[Bessemer process]]. The first billion-dollar corporation was [[United States Steel]], formed by financier [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others.&lt;ref name="Edward C. Kirkland 1961"&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860–1897'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hovey Calhoun, ''The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflicts'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment distribution ===
In the early 1900s there was a disparity between the levels of employment seen in the northern and southern United States. On average, states in the North had both a higher population, and a higher rate of employment than states in the South. The higher rate of employment is easily seen by considering the 1909 rates of employment compared to the populations of each state in the 1910 census. This difference was most notable in the states with the largest populations, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Each of these states had roughly 5 percent more of the total US workforce than would be expected given their populations. Conversely, the states in the South with the best actual rates of employment, North Carolina and Georgia, had roughly 2 percent less of the workforce than one would expect from their population. When the averages of all southern states and all northern states are taken, the trend holds with the North over-performing by about 2 percent, and the South under-performing by about 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steuart, William M. Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914 .. Washington: Govt. Print. Off., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Empire]] came to rival Britain as Europe's primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German [[Concern (business)|concern]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.  Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry and O'Rourke (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]]. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.  The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrochemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies "the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1990) p 474-5&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many spin offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Burhop, "Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck," ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] during the [[Belle Époque]] showed the value of the [[History of rail transport|railways]] for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it [[Belgian Revolution|broke away from the Netherlands]] and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. [[History of rail transport in Belgium|The system]] was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative uses==
There have been other times that have been called "second industrial revolution". Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of [[medieval technology]] in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the [[Tang Dynasty]], or of [[ancient Roman technology]], as first. "Second industrial revolution" has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after [[World War I]].

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the [[Atomic Age]] were more intense and lasting than those over the [[Space age]] but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the [[21st century]]&lt;ref&gt;google.com&lt;/ref&gt; the term "second industrial revolution" has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today's modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy.

== Building up the Stages ==
=== History ===
The history behind the action cycle starts from a conference in [[Italy]] attended by Donald Norman.
This excerpt has been taken from the book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am in Italy at a conference. I watch the next speaker attempt to thread a film onto a projector that he never used before. He puts the reel into place, then takes it off and reverses it. Another person comes to help. Jointly they thread the film through the projector and hold the free end, discussing how to put it on the takeup reel. Two more people come over to help and then another. The voices grow louder, in three languages: Italian, German and English. One person investigates the controls, manipulating each and announcing the result. Confusion mounts. I can no longer observe all that is happening. The conference organizer comes over. After a few moments he turns and faces the audience, who had been waiting patiently in the auditorium. "Ahem," he says, "is anybody expert in projectors?" Finally, fourteen minutes after the speaker had started to thread the film (and eight minutes after the scheduled start of the session) a blue-coated technician appears. He scowls, then promptly takes the entire film off the projector, rethreads it, and gets it working.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;[[Donald Norman|Norman, Donald A.]], "Psychology of Everyday Action". ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]''. New York: Basic Book, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–46}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norman pondered on the reasons that made something like threading of a projector difficult to do. To examine this, he wanted to know what happened when something implied nothing. In order to do that, he examined the structure of an action. So to get something done, a notion of what is wanted – the goal that is to be achieved, needs to be started. Then, something is done to the world i.e. take action to move oneself or manipulate someone or something. Finally, the checking is required if the goal was made. This led to formulation of Stages of Execution and Evaluation.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|46}}

=== Stages of Execution ===
''Execution'' formally means to perform or do something. Norman explains that a person sitting on an armchair while reading a book at dusk, might need more light when it becomes dimmer and dimmer. To do that, he needs to switch on the button of a lamp i.e. get more light (the [[goal]]). To do this, one must need to specify on how to move one's body, how to stretch to reach the light switch and how to extend one's finger to push the button. The goal has to be translated into an intention, which in turn has to be made into an action sequence.

Thus, formulation of stages of execution:
* Start at the top with the ''goal'', the state that is to be achieved.
* The goal is translated into an ''[[intention]]'' to do some action.
* The intention must be translated into a set of internal commands, an ''action sequence'' that can be performed to satisfy the intention.
* The action sequence is still a mutual event: nothing happens until it is ''executed'', performed upon the world.

=== Stages of Evaluation ===
''[[Evaluation]]'' formally means to examine and calculate. Norman explains that after turning on the light, we evaluate if it is actually turned on. A careful judgement is then passed on how the light has affected our world i.e. the room in which the person is sitting on the armchair while reading a book.

The formulation of the stages of evaluation can be described as:
* Evaluation starts with our ''[[perception]]'' of the world.
* This perception must then be ''interpreted'' according to our expectations.
* Then it is compared ''(evaluated)'' with respect to both our intentions and our goals.

=== Seven Stages of Action ===

'''Seven Stages of Action''' constitute four stages of execution, three stages of evaluation and our goals.

1. Forming the goal

2. Forming the intention

3. Specifying an action

4. Executing the action

5. Perceiving the state of the world

6. Interpreting the state of the world

7. Evaluating the outcome [http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1165167923187_663887047_11513&amp;partName=htmltext]

== The Gulfs  ==
=== The Gulf of Execution ===
The difference between the intentions and the allowable actions is the ''[[Gulf of execution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, Ted. "Lecture on Cognition and Perception". ''User Interface Design''. Simon Fraser University. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Consider the movie projector example: one problem resulted from the Gulf of Execution. The person wanted to set up the projector. Ideally, this would be a simple thing to do. But no, a long, complex sequence was required. It wasn't all clear what actions had to be done to accomplish the intentions of setting up the projector and showing the film."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Gulf of Evaluation ===
The ''[[Gulf of evaluation]]'' reflects the amount of effort that the person must exert to interpret the physical state of the system and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst, Marti. "Lecture on Gulf of Evaluation". ''User Interface Design and Development''. University of California at Berkeley. 1999. &lt;http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is213/s99/Lectures/Lecture10/sld010.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the movie projector example there was also a problem with the Gulf of Evaluation. Even when the film was in the projector, it was difficult to tell if it had been threaded correctly."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Usage as Design Aids ==
The seven-stage structure is referenced as design aid to act as a basic checklist for designers' &lt;ref&gt;Gore, Elizabeth. "III: Donald Norman: Seven Stages of Action. ''Web Site Analysis'', University of Illinois at Chicago. 2004. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707230442/http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; questions to ensure that the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation are bridged.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

The Seven Stages of Action can be broken down into 4 main principles of good design:
* ''[[Visibility]]'' - By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
* ''A Good Conceptual Model'' - The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
* ''Good mappings'' - It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.
* ''[[Feedback]]'' - The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of the actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''ShapeWriter''' (previously known as '''Shorthand-Aided Rapid Keyboarding (SHARK)''') was a keyboard text input method for tablet, handheld PCs, and mobile phones invented by [[Shumin Zhai]] and [[Per Ola Kristensson]] at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] and the Department of Computer and Information Science at [[Linköping University]].

Using ShapeWriter text entry software, a user draws words on a [[graphical keyboard]] using a pen. Instead of tapping the keys, the user draws a [[pen gesture]] that connects all the letters in the desired word. After some usage the user learns the movement pattern for the commonly used words and can write them faster than is possible on a traditional [[virtual keyboard]].

The first system described by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson (2003) was only a prototype system that could recognize about 100 pen gestures for the top 100 words used in the English language. It used a [[handwriting recognition]] [[algorithm]] that relied on [[dynamic programming]] to recognize the word patterns drawn from a lexicon. The next version described by Per Ola Kristensson and Shumin Zhai (2004) has a fundamentally different [[recognition engine]] that can recognize 50,000 - 60,000 words with low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. This system introduced the notion that every word in a large lexicon should be possible to write by tracing the letters. It is this system that was the basis for the software release on IBM alphaWorks that is generally associated with the term "ShapeWriter".

ShapeWriter was acquired by [[Nuance Communications]], and taken off the market in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.androidcentral.com/shapewriter-being-pulled-market-get-it-while-you-still-can&lt;/ref&gt; its technology presumably incorporated as part of Nuance's FlexT9 app in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuancemobilelife.com/apps/flext9/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/06/nuance-flext9-gives-you-four-android-input-methods-in-one-app/&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPhone==
ShapeWriter was made available for the iPhone approximately in 2008 and was revised several times (including ShapeWriter Lite and ShapeWriter Pro or Plus) before being pulled due to its sale to [[Nuance Communications]] (see following entry).

Those who purchased the iPhone version continued to use it and it also functioned on iPads v. 1 and 2 until 2013.

As of 2013 it no longer functions on iOS devices and is no longer available in Apple's App Store.

==Android==
ShapeWriter software was made available as a free application for [[Android (operating system)]] smartphones through the [[Android Market]]. As a touchscreen keyboard replacement, it had over 50,000 users on Android worldwide. It was available only for Android OS versions 1.6 or higher. ShapeWriter for Android was available in 7 European languages including English, Spanish, and German. There was also a Beta release for Android 1.5 phones including the [[HTC Hero]] and [[Droid Eris]].

ShapeWriter, Inc. was purchased by [[Nuance Communications]] and the ShapeWriter software was removed from the Android Market indefinitely on June 20, 2010.

{{styles}}

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

A '''vacuum airship''', also known as a '''vacuum balloon''', is a hypothetical [[airship]] that is [[Vacuum|evacuated]] rather than filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as hydrogen or helium. First proposed by Italian [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] in 1670,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J. (1631–1687); The Father of Aeronautics | url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/lana.htm | accessdate = 13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vacuum balloon would be the ultimate expression of displacement lift power.

==History==
From 1886 to 1900 [[Arthur De Bausset]] attempted in vain to raise funds to construct his "vacuum-tube" airship design, but despite early support in the United States Congress, the general public was skeptical. Illinois historian Howard Scamehorn reported that [[Octave Chanute]] and [[Albert Francis Zahm]] "publicly denounced and mathematically proved the fallacy of the vacuum principle", however the author does not give his source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scamehorn|first=Howard Lee|title=Balloons to Jets: A Century of Aeronautics in Illinois, 1855–1955|year=2000|pages=13–14|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bausset published a book on his design&lt;ref name="De Bausset 1887"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = De Bausset | first1 = Arthur | title = Aerial Navigation | publisher = Fergus Printing Co. | year = 1887 | location = Chicago | url = https://archive.org/details/aerialnavigatio00chicgoog | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered $150,000 stock in the Transcontinental Aerial Navigation Company of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aerial Navigation | journal = New York Times | date = February 14, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/02/14/103137015.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = To Navigate the Air | journal = New York Times | date = February 19, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/02/19/103097161.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent application was eventually denied on the basis that it was "wholly theoretical, everything being based upon calculation and nothing upon trial or demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell (Commissioner) | title = Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1890 | publisher = US Government Printing Office | year = 1891 | page = 46 | accessdate = | quote = 50 O.

In 1921, Lavanda Armstrong discloses a composite wall structure with a vacuum chamber "surrounded by a second envelop constructed so as to hold air under pressure, the walls of the envelope being spaced from one another and tied together", including a honeycomb-like cellular structure, however leaving some uncertainty how to achieve adequate buoyancy given "walls may be made as thick and strong as desired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=1390745 |status=patent | inventor= Lavanda M Armstrong | country=US  | title = Aircraft of the lighter-than-air type | pubdate=Sep 13, 1921  |assign1=Lavanda M Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, David Noel discussed the use of geodesic sphere covered with plastic film and "a double balloon containing pressurized air between the
skins, and a vacuum in the centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages=262–266 | journal=Correspondence, Speculations in Science and Technology  | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=1983 | title=Lighter than Air Craft Using Vacuum  | author=David Noel | url=http://aoi.com.au/Originals/VacuumBalloon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  1982–1985 Emmanuel  Bliamptis elaborated on energy sources and use of "inflatable strut rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=4534525 |status=patent | inventor= Emmanuel  Bliamptis | country=US  | title = Evacuated balloon for solar energy collection | pubdate=Aug 13, 1985 |assign1=Emmanuel  Bliamptis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–2007 Akhmeteli and Gavrilin address choice of materials ("beryllium, boron carbide ceramic, and diamond-like carbon" or aluminum) in honeycomb double layer craft to address buckling issues.&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Principle==
An [[airship]] operates on the principle of [[buoyancy]], according to [[Archimedes' principle]]. In an airship, air is the fluid in contrast to a traditional [[ship]] where [[water]] is the fluid.

The [[density of air]] at standard temperature and pressure is 1.28 g/l, so 1 [[liter]] of displaced air has sufficient buoyant force to lift 1.28 g. Airships use a bag to displace a large volume of air; the bag is usually filled with a lightweight gas such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. The total lift generated by an airship is equal to the weight of the air it displaces, minus the weight of the materials used in its construction including the gas used to fill the bag.

Vacuum airships would replace the helium gas with a near-[[vacuum]] environment, having no mass, density would be near to 0.00 g/l, which would theoretically be able to provide the full lift potential of displaced air, so every liter of vacuum could lift 1.28 g. Using the [[molar volume]], the mass of 1 liter of helium (at 1 atmospheres of pressure) is found to be 0.178 g. If helium is used instead of vacuum, the lifting power of every liter is reduced by 0.178 g, so the effective lift is reduced by 14%. A 1-liter volume of hydrogen has a [[mass]] of 0.090 g.

The main problem with the concept of vacuum airships is that, with a near-vacuum inside the airbag, the exterior [[atmospheric pressure]] is not balanced by any internal pressure. This enormous imbalance of forces would cause the airbag to collapse unless it were extremely strong (in an ordinary airship, the force is balanced by helium, making this unnecessary). Thus the difficulty is in constructing an airbag with the additional strength to resist this extreme net force, without weighing the structure down so much that the greater lifting power of vacuum is negated.

==Material constraints==
===Compressive strength===
From the analysis by Akhmeteli and Gavrilin:&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"&gt;{{cite patent | number=2007001053 |status=application | inventor=AM Akhmeteli, AV Gavrilin | country=US  | title =US Patent Application 11/517915. Layered shell vacuum balloons| pubdate=Feb 23, 2006 |pridate=2004-05-13 |assign1=Andrey M Akhmeteli and Andrey V Gavrilin | url=http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/vacuum_balloons_cip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force on a hemi-spherical shell of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by an external pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2 P&lt;/math&gt;. Since the force on each hemisphere has to balance along the equator the compressive stress will be, assuming &lt;math&gt;h&lt;&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi R^2 P / 2 \pi R h = R P / 2 h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the shell thickness.

Neutral buoyancy occurs when the shell has the same mass as the displaced air, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;h/R = \rho_a/(3 \rho_s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is the air density and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the shell density, assumed to be homogeneous. Combining with the stress equation gives 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = (3/2)(\rho_s/\rho_a)P&lt;/math&gt;.
For aluminum and terrestrial conditions Akhmeteli and Gavrilin estimate the stress as &lt;math&gt;3.2\cdot 10^8&lt;/math&gt; Pa, of the same order of magnitude as the compressive strength of aluminum alloys.

===Buckling===
Akhmeteli and Gavrilin note, however, that the compressive strength calculation disregards [[buckling]], and using R. Zoelli's formula for the critical buckling pressure of a sphere
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr} = \frac{2Eh^2}{\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}\frac{1}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[modulus of elasticity]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poisson ratio]] of the shell. Substituting the earlier expression gives a necessary condition for a feasible vacuum balloon shell:
:&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 = \frac{9P_{cr}\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}{2\rho_a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The requirement is about &lt;math&gt;4.5\cdot10^5 kg^{-1} m^5 s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Akhmeteli and Gavrilin assert that this cannot even be achieved using diamond (&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 \approx 1\cdot 10^5&lt;/math&gt;), and 
propose that dropping the assumption that the shell is a homogeneous material may allow lighter and stiffer structures (e.g. a [[honeycomb structure]]).&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Atmospheric constraints==
A vacuum airship should at least float (Archimedes law) and resist external pressure (strength law, depending on design, like the above R. Zoelli's formula for sphere). These two conditions may be rewritten as an inequality where a complex of several physical constants related to the material of the airship is to be lesser than a complex of atmospheric parameters. Thus, for a sphere (hollow sphere and, to a lesser extent, cylinder are practically the only designs for which a strength law is known) it is &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} &lt; \sqrt{1-\frac{P_{\rm int}}{P}}\cdot L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm int}&lt;/math&gt; is pressure within the sphere, while &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana coefficient») and &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana atmospheric  ratio») are:&lt;ref name=shikhovtsev16&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mir.k156.ru/aeroplan/de_bausset_aeroplane-03-1.html#a03-1-2016 |title=Is FLanar Possible? | author=E. Shikhovtsev | date=2016 | accessdate=2016-06-19 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} = 2.79\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}} \cdot (1-\mu^2)^{0.25}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} \approx 2.71\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}}&lt;/math&gt; with an error of order of 3% or less);
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}} \cdot \frac{M_a}{T_a}&lt;/math&gt;),
where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm atm} = 101325&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Pa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm atm} = 1.22&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;kg/m^3&lt;/math&gt; are pressure and density of standard Earth atmosphere at sea level, &lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; are molar mass (kg/kmol) and temperature (K) of atmosphere at floating area.
Of all known planets and moons of the Sun system only the Venusian atmosphere has &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; big enough to surpass &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; for such materials as some composites (below altitude of ca. 15&amp;nbsp;km) and graphene (below altitude of ca. 40&amp;nbsp;km). Both materials may survive in the Venusian atmosphere. The equation for &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; shows that exoplanets with dense, cold and high-molecular (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; type) atmospheres may be suitable for vacuum airships, but it is a rare type of atmosphere.

==In fiction==
In the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] novel ''[[Tarzan at the Earth's Core]]'' [[Tarzan]] travels to [[Pellucidar]] in a vacuum airship constructed of the fictional material Harbenite.

In ''Passarola Rising'', novelist [[Azhar Abidi]] imagines what might have happened had [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] built and flown a vacuum airship.

Spherical vacuum body airships using the [[Magnus effect]] and made of [[carbyne]] or similar superhard carbon are glimpsed in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''.

In ''Maelstrom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rifters.com/real/MAELSTROM.htm|title=Maelstrom by Peter Watts|first=Peter|last=Watts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth:B-Max'', author [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]] describes various flying devices, such as "botflies" and "lifters" that use "vacuum bladders" to keep them airborne.

In ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]], a vacuum balloon is used by the narrative character Bascule in his quest to rescue Ergates. Vacuum dirigibles (airships) are also mentioned as a notable engineering feature of the space-faring utopian civilisation [[The Culture]] in Banks' novel ''[[Look to Windward]]''&lt;!-- At the end of Chapter 4, Scorched Ground, dialogue between Zleper and 947 Praf. --&gt;, and the vast vacuum dirigible Equatorial 353 is a pivotal location in the final Culture novel, ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
