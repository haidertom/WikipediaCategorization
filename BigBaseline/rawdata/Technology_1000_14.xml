'''Adaptxt''' is a [[predictive text]] application for [[mobile phones]], developed by [[KeyPoint Technologies]], a [[UK]]-based software company. The application is designed to improve text entry on mobile devices by making it faster and error-free. It achieves this by predicting the next word as well as the word being typed, continuously adapting to the user's writing-style and vocabulary.

==History and product features==
Launched in 2006, Adaptxt supported [[Windows Mobile]] [[smartphones]] only. Adaptxt provides features such as context-based next-word suggestions, word completion, personal dictionary, dynamic language detection, conversion from [[SMS]] language to standard [[English language|English]] and vice versa, multilingual text entry and a feature that learns new words and context while typing.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6121806.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Scotland &amp;#124; Glasgow and West &amp;#124; Jobs boost for text message firm |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application stores the new words in the user’s personal dictionary, where they can be edited. KeyPoint also claims that Adaptxt users can type in any of the installed languages without changing their keyboard language or dictionary, thanks to an engine capable of recognizing the language in use. This feature is supposed to be an added value for users who are bi-lingual or occasionally type in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomonews.com/kpt-identifies-351m-untapped-market-for-language-dictionaries-on-mobile-phones/ |title=KPT identifies $351m untapped market for language dictionaries on mobile phonesGoMo News |publisher=Gomonews.com |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version for [[Symbian S60]] smartphones was released in 2008, with improved support for third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Zach |url=http://www.bgr.com/2008/04/01/keypoint-releases-new-adaptxt-beta-for-s60/ |title=Keypoint Releases New Adaptxt Beta for S60 |publisher=BGR |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, KeyPoint introduced a feature to scan personal data, including calendar entries, phonebook contacts, SMS and email inbox and sent items. The “Scan Facebook” feature learns words from the user’s [[Facebook]] profile. The new words learnt are added to the personal dictionary and offered as suggestions during text entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://predictivetext.blogspot.com/2009/06/adaptxt-for-nokia-s60-smartphone-beta.html |title=Predictive Text: Adaptxt for Nokia S60 Smartphone (Beta v2.4) |publisher=Predictivetext.blogspot.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, KeyPoint also launched a new version of Adaptxt with [[error correction]]. This feature provides alternative suggestions for incorrect spellings. Automated correction of spelling mistakes were also made available, with an option to revert to the exact word entered by the user in case of unwanted corrections. All these features can now be found in the Symbian version of the product and most of them can also be found in the Windows Mobile version.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Keypoint Technologies (www.keypoint-tech.com) |url=http://www.adaptxt.com/ |title=Adaptxt |publisher=Adaptxt |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KeyPoint was also the first software company to introduce professional add-on dictionaries that provide industry-specific word and phrase suggestions related to a particular profession, such as medicine, law, IT and telecommunications, business and finance.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt; Users can download additional language and professional dictionaries from the product website directly to their devices.

In May 2011, KeyPoint made Adaptxt [[Open-source software|open source]] through the project "OpenAdaptxt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openadaptxt.sourceforge.net/index.html |title=OpenAdaptxt |publisher=Openadaptxt.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-compatible version of the application has been launched in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlegreenrobot.co.uk/news/adaptxt-the-latest-best-android-keyboard/ |title=Adaptxt, the latest best Android keyboard? |publisher=Little Green Robot |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptxt supports both [[touch-screen]] and hard-keyboard devices with [[Telephone keypad|12-key]], 20-key or [[QWERTY]] layouts. On 12-key phones, Adaptxt offers both [[Multi-tap]] and [[Predictive]] entry modes.

More than 50 languages and respective keyboard layouts are supported by Adaptxt, including: [[American English|English US]], [[British English|English UK]], [[Languages of France|European French]], [[Canadian French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[European Spanish]], [[Latin-American Spanish]], [[European Portuguese]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hinglish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Kannada language|Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]].

'''Ami Dar''' (born January 7, 1961) is the Founder and Executive Director of [[Action Without Borders|Idealist.org.]] Idealist serves more than 120,000 organizations around the world and has more than 1.4 million visitors every month between the English site (idealist.org), and the Spanish site (idealistas.org).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.idealist.org/|title=Idealist|website=Idealist|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Dar was born January 7, 1961, in [[Jerusalem]], Israel, the eldest of three children, to a school teacher mother and diplomat father. He grew up in Peru and Mexico, and it was in Mexico City where he first became aware of the contrast of wealth and poverty around him, which started him on a path of dedication to social justice. 

In 1976, Dar and his family returned to Israel and from 1979 - 1982, he completed his mandatory service as a [[paratrooper]]. During this time Dar had an insight that fundamentally changed his thinking about borders and humanity and how labels define and separate people, which is often referred to as the "sock sharers story." {{Citation needed|reason=Medium is not a neutral source|date=August 2018}}

==Career==
In 1988 Dar joined [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]], a software company based in [[Tel Aviv]]. From 1988 to 1992 he served as the International Marketing Manager. In 1992 he was named President and he relocated to New York City to establish their [[North America]]n branch. 

=== Idealist.org ===
By 1995 he had founded an early iteration of [[Action Without Borders|Idealist]], The Contact Center Network sponsored meeting spaces in several communities where people could connect with neighbors who might share interests and ideas for local action. In 1996 Dar began calling the online network [http://www.idealist.org/ Idealist.org]. 

=== Idealists of the World ===


In January of 2018 the Idealist team launched '''Idealists of the World''' which has over 23,300 members world wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://act.idealist.org/|title=Idealist Days|website=Idealist Days|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Idealists of the World participate in global Idealist Days which occur when the day and the month are the same number. The first global Idealist Day occurred on March 3rd, 2018 (3/3) with "75 events mobilizing nearly 500 people around the world, and 3000 people in the Idealists of the World Facebook group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://act.idealist.org/about/|title=About|date=2018-03-21|work=Idealist Days|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy behind Idealist Day is rooted in Ami Dar's vision of a world progressing towards positive social change. This is accomplished by people making connections online and in person, bridging divides to collaborate together for a better tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AmiDar/idealists-of-the-world-unite-c84b69429086|title=Idealists of the world, unite!|last=Dar|first=Ami|date=2018-01-01|website=Ami Dar|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this vision Dar has stated,&lt;blockquote&gt;I can't help noticing that all over the world, behind every label and stereotype, there are people who share some basic values. And I can’t help thinking that if these people could somehow work together, the world would be a very different place. What are these values? Treating others the way we’d like to be treated is a good start. But we can go beyond that. For example, I believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence:

''“'''Working with others, in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect, I want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AmiDar/idealists-of-the-world-unite-c84b69429086|title=Idealists of the world, unite!|last=Dar|first=Ami|date=2018-01-01|website=Ami Dar|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="126816">This is a '''comparison of orbital launch systems'''. The following exposes the full list of conventional orbital launch systems. For the short simple list of conventional launcher families, see: [[Comparison of orbital launchers families]]. For the list of predominantly solid-fuelled orbital launch systems, see: [[Comparison of solid-fuelled orbital launch systems]].

[[Spacecraft propulsion]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of [[engine]] is called a [[rocket engine]].&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s. A conventional [[solid rocket]] or a conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]] is a rocket with a motor that uses [[solid propellant]]s ([[fuel]]/[[oxidizer]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first medieval rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder; they were used by the Chinese, Indians, Mongols and Arabs, in warfare as early as the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbit]]al [[launch vehicle|launch systems]] are rockets and [[non-rocket spacelaunch|other systems]] capable of placing [[payload]]s into or [[escape trajectory|beyond]] [[Earth orbit]]. All current spacecraft use conventional chemical rockets ([[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] or [[solid rocket|solid-fuel]]) for launch, though some&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as the [[Pegasus rocket]] and [[SpaceShipOne]].&lt;/ref&gt; have used [[air-breathing engine]]s on their [[Multistage rocket|first stage]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often [[monopropellant rocket]]s) or [[resistojet rocket]]s for [[orbital station-keeping]] and some use [[momentum wheel]]s for [[attitude control]]. Soviet bloc satellites have used [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used [[ion thruster]]s and [[Hall effect thruster]]s (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==

&lt;ref name="N3"&gt;The Saturn V made 13 launches, 12 of which reached the correct orbits, and the other ([[Apollo 6]]) reached a different orbit than the one which had been planned; however, some mission objectives could still be completed; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Flight_History.pdf NASA, Saturn V News Reference, Appendix: Saturn V Flight History (1968)]. For more information, see the [[Saturn V]] article.  The Saturn V launch record is usually quoted as having never failed, e.g. ''"The rocket was masterminded by Wernher Von Braun and did not fail in any of its flights"'', Alan Lawrie and Robert Godwin; [http://www.apogeespacebooks.com/Books/Saturn.html Saturn], but the Apollo 6 launch should be considered a partial mission failure. The 13th launch of Saturn V was in special configuration (SA-513) with the [[Skylab]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="N4"&gt;The N1 rocket was initially designed for 75mt LEO capacity and launch attempts were made with this version, but there were studies to increase the payload capacity to 90—95 mt, if a liquid-hydrogen upper stage engine could be developed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controlled vocabularies''' provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval.  They are used in [[subject indexing]] schemes, [[subject heading]]s, [[thesauri]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204132228/http://www.imresources.fit.qut.edu.au/vocab/ Controlled Vocabularies]  Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090314094707/http://www.fao.org/aims/kos_list_type.htm Controlled Vocabularies]  Links to examples of thesauri and classification schemes used in the domain of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry etc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and other forms of [[knowledge organization system]]s. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction.

== In library and information science ==

In [[library and information science]] controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of [[word (linguistics)|word]]s and [[phrase]]s, which are used to [[Tag (metadata)|tag]] units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Warner, [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~i385e/readings/Warner-aTaxonomyPrimer.html A taxonomy primer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Fast, Fred Leise and Mike Steckel, [http://boxesandarrows.com/what-is-a-controlled-vocabulary/]&lt;/ref&gt; Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of [[homographs]], [[synonyms]] and [[polyseme]]s by a [[bijection]] between concepts and authorized terms. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.

For example, in the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/controlled-vocabularies/|title=Controlled Vocabularies  {{!}} Librarians {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms—subject headings in this case—have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (''cockroach'' versus ''Periplaneta americana''), and choices between synonyms (''automobile'' versus ''car''), among other difficult issues.

Choices of authorized terms are based on the principles of ''user warrant'' (what terms users are likely to use), ''literary warrant'' (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and ''structural warrant'' (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).

Controlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of [[homographs]], with qualifiers. For example, the term ''pool'' has to be qualified to refer to either ''swimming pool'' or the game ''pool'' to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept.

There are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.

Historically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not.

For example, the [[Library of Congress Subject Heading]] itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term "[[Hypernym|Broader term]]" and "[[Hyponym|Narrow term]]".

The [[terminology|terms]] are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress system]], [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]], and [[Sears Subject Headings|Sears]]. Well known thesauri include the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] and the [[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] Thesaurus.

Choosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue.

Controlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as [[Tag (metadata)|tags]], to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as [[metadata]].

== Indexing languages ==

There are three main types of indexing languages.

* Controlled indexing language – only approved terms can be used by the indexer to describe the document
* [[Natural language]] indexing language – any term from the document in question can be used to describe the document
* Free indexing language – any term (not only from the document) can be used to describe the document

When indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document.

In recent years [[free text search]] as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is ''indexed''). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.

Controlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce [[Relevance (Information Retrieval)|irrelevant]] items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items ([[false positives]]) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of [[natural language]]. Take the English word [[football (word)|''football'']] for example. ''Football'' is the name given to a number of different [[team sport]]s. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is [[Football (soccer)|association football]], which also happens to be called ''[[soccer]]'' in several countries. The word ''football'' is also applied to [[rugby football]] ([[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]), [[American football]], [[Australian rules football]], [[Gaelic football]], and [[Canadian football]]. A search for ''football'' therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated.

Compared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually [[relevance|relevant]] to the search topic).

In some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.

However, a controlled vocabulary search may also lead to unsatisfactory [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question.

This is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer.

Another possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with "football" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless.

On the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination.

Controlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words.

The use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts  or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry.  Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.

Numerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including [[faceted classification]], which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.

==Applications==
Controlled vocabularies, such as the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]],  are an essential component of [[bibliography]], the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in [[library and information science]]. In the 1950s, government agencies  began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) developed by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup [[X.25]] networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first [[full text]] databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.

In large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve [[technical communication]]. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing.  This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in [[technical writing]] and [[knowledge management]], where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a [[document]] or [[organization]] instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.

Web searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a [[Semantic Web]], in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable [[metadata]] scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the [[Dublin Core]] Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for [[Web indexing|indexing web pages]] is [[Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System|PSH]].

It is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web.&lt;ref&gt;Cory Doctorow, [http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm Metacrap].&lt;/ref&gt; To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on [[faceted classification]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Pilgrim, [http://petervandijck.com/xfml/ eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}

Controlled vocabularies of the [[Semantic Web]] define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of "Person", such as the Friend of a Friend ([[FOAF]]) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of [[Schema.org]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Person |title=The Person vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of [[Schema.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Book |title=The Book vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general publication terms from the [[Dublin Core]] vocabulary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event with the Event vocabulary of [[Schema.org]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schema.org/Event |title=The Event vocabulary of Schema.org |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

To use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, [[Microdata (HTML)|HTML5 Microdata]], or [[JSON-LD]] in the markup, or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.

'''Cut-off factor''' (AKA "'''cut-off length'''") is a [[coefficient|factor]]  used to calculate the [[length]] of a [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] [[cutting|cut]] to achieve the desired overall length of [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] plus [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]]. It is commonly seen in [[hydraulic]] hose and fitting specifications. The cut-off factor is specific to a particular hose fitting.

The [[formula]] used in calculating the optimum overall length is:

&lt;math&gt;Cut\ Hose\ Length\ = Hose\ Assembly\ Overall\ Length - C1 - C2&lt;/math&gt;.

In this formula, C1 represents the cut-off factor of the first hose end and C2 represents the cut-off factor of the second hose end.

The DAA platform enables secure authentication of a mobile user whilst simultaneously preserving privacy of the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=451 Research Analyst Report|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-30|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3955296/ovum-report-averon.pdf?hsCtaTracking=21516a12-2112-4331-b738-9cc9ebbd4b19%7C77dd6935-548f-45ff-9b6a-8652e13c284c/|title=Ovum Report: On The Radar |last=Kellet|first=Andrew|date=2018-03-21|website=ovum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was developed in stealth from late 2015, first publicly introduced by Averon in 2018, and featured at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] as a new technology that combats the increasing threats of cybercrime and consumer account hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crn.com.au/news/10-coolest-smb-products-at-ces-2018-480892?utm_source=desktop&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share/|title=10 Coolest Products at CES 2018|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|date=2018-01-11|website=CRN|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Overview ==
In contrast to legacy methods of cybersecurity, the DAA platform bypasses end user actions, and rather than focusing on the authentication of a user's device, DAA instead provides autonomous authentication of a user's mobile phone number, since the mobile phone number continues to be associated with the user even when they lose, destroy or upgrade their mobile phone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redherring.com/mobile/averon-ceo-wendell-brown-ux-now-crucial-element-cybersecurity/|title=UX Now Crucial Element in Cybersecurity|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2017-11-02|website=redherring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAA method uses a proprietary mix of technology developed by Averon that works inside the secure mobile network data pipelines together with encrypted technology already within every smartphone. The combination of these autonomous authentication methods has been described by research analysts as a faster, more secure, and stronger method of cybersecurity than traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockchain and privacy properties ==
Blockchain technology incorporated into the DAA platform ensures the privacy of end users. No identifiable personal data is maintained on the platform, therefore public disclosure of one's authentic identity (such as for the purpose of verified social media interactions) is voluntary. DAA technology affords the end user full control over identity disclosure in any given online interaction, which can be controlled by the end user in varying degrees from fully anonymous to fully identified publicly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martechseries.com/mobile/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-invests-in-mobile-identity-start-up-averon/|title=Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Invests in Mobile Identity Startup Averon |last=|first=|date=2018-03-22|website=martechseries.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases involving the need for anonymity with regard to an end user's safety, such as in cases of whistleblowers or political activists, the DAA platform's blockchain technology provides a method for both complete anonymity with the option of voluntary verification of limited but often needed data (such as verifying an anonymous user's general location). Thus DAA technology alleviates the heretofore insurmountable challenge of protecting user privacy with the need for authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
The DAA technology platform was designed to be seamlessly adopted for utilization in a wide variety of industries and use cases in which mobile authentication of users is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ideo-colab/digital-identity-is-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-b15398180bdf/|title=Digital Identity Is Broken, But We Can Fix It|last=Elitzer|first=Dan|date=2017-04-11|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://451research.com/report-short?entityId=94202/|title=Averon offers frictionless mobile authentication|last=Bekker|first=Garrett|date=2018-01-28|website=451 Research|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Since its introduction to the market in 2018, the DAA platform has been recognized by a number of industry groups for its innovation, including winning the Gold prize at the 2018 [[Edison Awards]], a Cybersecurity Excellence Award, and a BIG Innovation 2018 Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisonawards.com/winners2018.php  |title=Edison Awards 2018 Winners|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2018/04/17/8737272.htm/|title=Gold Edison Award 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=tmcnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bintelligence.com/blog/2018/2/7/55-chosen-as-winners-in-annual-big-innovation-awards|title=BIG Innovation Winners 2018|last=|first=|date=2018-02-07|website=bintelligence.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/candidates/averon|title=Cybersecurity Excellence Awards|last=|first=|date=2018-05-03|website=oneworldidentity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12339">'''Document automation''' (also known as '''document assembly''') is the design of systems and [[workflow]]s that assist in the creation of [[electronic document]]s. These include logic-based systems that use segments of pre-existing text and/or data to assemble a new document. This process is increasingly used within certain industries to assemble legal documents, contracts and letters. Document automation systems can also be used to automate all conditional text, variable text, and data contained within a set of documents.

Automation systems allow companies to minimize data entry, reduce the time spent proof-reading, and reduce the risks associated with [[human error]]. Additional benefits include: time and financial savings due to decreased paper handling, document loading, storage, distribution, postage/shipping, faxes, telephone, labor and waste.

== Document assembly ==
The basic functions are to replace the cumbersome manual filling in of repetitive documents with template-based systems where the user answers software-driven interview questions or data entry screen. The information collected then populates the document to form a good first draft'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/2/170 Article: Disrupting Conventional Law Firm Business Models using Document Assembly] Mountain, Int J Law Info Tech., 2006; 0: eal019v1&lt;/ref&gt; Today's more advanced document automation systems allow users to create their own data and rules (logic) without the need for programming.

While document automation software is used primarily in the [[law|legal]], [[financial services]], and [[risk management]] industries, it can be used in any industry that creates transaction-based documents.  A good example of how document automation software can be used is with [[commercial mortgage]] documents. A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including:
* [[promissory note]]
* environmental indemnity
* [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]]
* [[mortgage law|mortgage]]
* [[guaranty]]
Some of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Established companies in this field includes the likes of Contract Express from Thomson Reuters

Simpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.

== In supply chain management ==
There are many documents used in [[logistics]]. They are called: [[invoice]]s, [[packing list]]s/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement [[form (document)|form]]s/[[reports]] of many types (e.g. [[MSDS]], damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), [[import]]/[[export]], [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the [[contracts]] between the [[consignee]] and the [[consignor]], so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a [[third party logistics]] company (3PL) and [[governments]]. [[Document]] handling within [[logistics]], [[supply chain management]] and [[distribution center]]s is usually performed [[manual labor]] or semi-automatically using [[bar code scanner]]s, [[software]] and tabletop [[laser printer]]s. There are some [[manufacturer]]s of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed [[wallet]]/pouch to the [[shipping container]] (usually a flexible [[polybag]] or [[corrugated fiberboard]]/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and [[Identity Theft]] are major concerns, especially with the increase of [[e-Commerce]], [[Internet]]/[[Online shopping]] and [[Shopping channel]] (other, past references are catalogue and [[mail order]] shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Warehouse management system|WMS]], [[Transportation management system|TMS]], legacy [[middleware]] and most accounting packages.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

A number of research projects have looked into wider [[standardization]] and automation of documents in the [[Freight transport|freight industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|title=e-FREIGHT is an Integrated project within the EU's 7th Framework programme|publisher=e-Freight|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530094924/http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IATA]].

== In legal services ==
The role of automation technology in the production of legal documents has been widely recognised.

== In insurance ==
Insurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured.  Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents:
* Welcome letter
* Contract
* Certificate
* State-specific policy documents
* Listing of items insured and insurance amounts
* Amendments
* Riders
* ID card
* Company information
* Marketing material (other products)

A lot of work can go into putting one packet together.  In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.

'''Electronic funds transfer''' (EFT) are electronic transfer of money from one [[bank account]] to another, either within a single [[financial institution]] or across multiple institutions, via [[computer]]-based systems, without the direct intervention of bank staff.

According to the United States [[Electronic Fund Transfer Act]] of 1978 it is ''a funds transfer initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer (including on-line banking) or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer’s account. &lt;ref name="EFTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2008/0807/08-07_attachment.pdf |title=Electronic Fund Transfer Act |publisher=Federal Reserve Board |year=1978|website=www.federalreserve.gov |access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

EFT transactions are known by a number of names across countries and different payment systems.  For example, in the United States, they may be referred to as "electronic [[Cheque|checks]]" or "e-checks". In the United Kingdom, the term "bank transfer" and "bank payment" are used, while in several other European countries "[[giro|giro transfer]]" is the common term.

== Types ==
EFTs include, but are not limited to: &lt;ref name="EFTA"/&gt;
* [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) transfers;
* [[direct deposit]] payment or withdrawals of funds initiated by the payer;
* [[direct debit]] payments for which a business debits the consumer's [[bank account]]s for payment for goods or services; 
* transfers initiated by telephone; 
* transfers resulting from [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]] transactions, whether or not initiated through an [[payment terminal]].
* [[wire transfer]] via an international banking network such as [[SWIFT]];
* [[electronic bill payment]] in [[online banking]], which may be delivered by EFT or paper check;
* transactions involving [[Stored-value card|stored value]] of [[electronic money]], possibly in a [[private currency]];
* [[instant payment]].

In [[structural engineering]] and [[material science]], '''fast fracture''' is a term given to a phenomenon in which a [[wiktionary:flaw|flaw]] (such as a crack) in a material expands quickly, and leads to [[catastrophic failure]] of the material. [[Stress (physics)|Stress]] acting on a material when fast fracture occurs is less than the material's [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]]. A very representative example of this is what happens when poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon's material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1024">'''Fast Interrupt Requests''' (FIQs) are a specialized type of [[Interrupt Request]], a standard technique used in computer CPUs to deal with events which need to be processed as they occur such as receiving data from a network card, or keyboard or mouse actions. FIQs are specific to the [[ARM architecture|ARM CPU architecture]], which supports two types of interrupts; FIQs for fast, low latency interrupt handling and Interrupt Requests (IRQs), for more general interrupts.&lt;ref&gt;https://infocenter.arm.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marilynwolf.us/CaC3e/&lt;/ref&gt;

An FIQ takes priority over an IRQ in an ARM system. Also, only one FIQ source at a time is supported. This helps reduce interrupt latency as the interrupt service routine can be executed directly without determining the source of the interrupt. A context save is not required for servicing an FIQ since it has its own set of banked registers. This reduces the overhead of [[context switch]]ing.

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses of the concept==
*[[Giorgio Agamben]] drew heavily from Heidegger in his interpretation of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault's]] concept of ''[[dispositif]]'' (apparatus).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The first [[rocket]]s were used as propulsion systems for [[arrows]], and may have appeared as early as the 10th century [[Song dynasty]] [[China]]. However more solid documentary evidence does not appear until the 13th century. The technology probably spread across [[Eurasia]] in the wake of the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century. Usage of rockets as weapons before modern rocketry is attested in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[Europe]]. One of the first recorded [[rocket launcher]]s is the "wasp nest" fire arrow launcher produced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1380. In Europe rockets were also used in the same year at the [[Battle of Chioggia]]. The [[Joseon]] kingdom of Korea used a type of mobile [[multiple rocket launcher]] known as the "Munjong [[Hwacha]]" by 1451. Iron-cased rockets, known as [[Mysorean rockets]], were developed in [[Kingdom of Mysore]] by the mid 18th century in India,&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Bowdoin Van Riper|title=Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA14|date=29 October 2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8792-5|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were later copied by the [[British people|British]]. The later models and improvements were known as the [[Congreve rocket]] and used in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Use of liquid propellants instead of gunpowder greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in World War I, and opened up the possibility of [[manned spaceflight]] after 1918.

==China==
{{see also|Timeline of the Gunpowder Age}}

The dating of the invention of the first rocket, otherwise known as the gunpowder propelled [[fire arrow]], is disputed. The [[History of Song]] attributes the invention to two different people at different times, [[Feng Zhisheng]] in 969 and [[Tang Fu]] in 1000. However [[Joseph Needham]] argues that rockets could not have existed befoire the 12th century, since the gunpowder formulas listed in the [[Wujing Zongyao]] are not suitable as rocket propellant.{{sfn|Lorge|2005}}

Rockets may have been used as early as 1232, when reports appeared describing fire arrows and 'iron pots' that could be heard for 5 [[League (unit)|leagues]] (25&amp;nbsp;km, or 15 miles) when they exploded upon impact, causing devastation for a radius of {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, apparently due to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/rocket.htm|title=A Brief History of Rocketry |publisher=Solarviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rockets are recorded to have been used by the Song navy in a military exercise dated to 1245. Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the 'ground-rat,' a type of [[firework]], had  frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son the [[Emperor Lizong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Alfred W. | title = Throwing Fire: Projectile Technology Through History | year = 2002 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-79158-8 | pages = 100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, rockets are included in the military treatise ''[[Huolongjing]]'', also known as the Fire Drake Manual, written by the Chinese artillery officer [[Jiao Yu]] in the mid-14th century. This text mentions the first known [[multistage rocket]], the 'fire-dragon issuing from the water' (huo long chu shui), thought to have been used by the Chinese navy.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket launchers known as "wasp nests" were ordered by the Ming army in 1380.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=514}}

The American historian [[Frank H. Winter]] proposed in ''The Proceedings of the Twentieth and Twenty-First History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics'' that southern China and the [[Laos|Laotian]] community [[Rocket Festival|rocket festivals]] might have been key in the subsequent spread of rocketry in the Orient.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Winter, "The `Boun Bang Fai' Rockets of Thailand and Laos:", in Lloyd H. Cornett, Jr., ed., History of Rocketry and Astronautics - Proceedings of the Twentieth and Twenty-First History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics, AAS History Series, Vol. 15 (Univelt Inc.: San Diego, 1993), pp. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of rocket technology==
===Mongols===
The Chinese fire arrow was adopted by the Mongols in northern China, who employed Chinese rocketry experts as [[mercenaries]] in the Mongol army. Rockets are thought to have spread via the [[Mongol invasions]] to other areas of Eurasia in the mid 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Rockets appear in Arab literature in 1258 A.D., describing Mongol invaders' use of them on February 15 to capture the city of Baghdad." {{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|title=A brief history of rocketry|work=NASA Spacelink |accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket-like weapons are reported to have been used at the [[Battle of Mohi]] in the year 1241.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt|title=A brief history of rocketry|work=NASA Spacelink |accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
Between 1270 and 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote his ''al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya'' (''The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices''), which included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 of which are for rockets.&lt;ref name=Gunpowder&gt;{{harvnb|Hassan|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ahmad Y Hassan]], al-Rammah's recipes were more explosive than rockets used in China at the time.&lt;ref name=Hassan-Chemical&gt;{{harvnb|Hassan|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansour|first1=Professor Dr. Mohamed|title=Muslim Rocket Technology|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/muslim-rocket-technology|website=muslimheritage.com|publisher=Muslim Heritage Awareness Group|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Mitch|title=Hassan Al Rammah|url=http://weaponsandwarfare.com/?p=16618|website=weaponsandwarfare.com|publisher=Weapons and Warfare|accessdate=3 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117002101/http://weaponsandwarfare.com/?p=16618|archivedate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology used by al-Rammah indicates a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons he wrote about, such as rockets and fire lances.&lt;ref name="Jack Kelly 2005 22"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA22|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|author=Jack Kelly|edition=illustrated|year=2005 |publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4 |page=22 |quote=Around 1240 the Arabs acquired knowledge of saltpeter (“Chinese snow”) from the East, perhaps through India.

Around that same year, a Syrian named Hasan al-Rammah wrote a book that, as he put it, "treat of machines of fire to be used for amusement of for useful purposes." He talked of rockets, fireworks, fire lances, and other incendiaries, using terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources. He gave instructions for the purification of saltpeter and the recipes for making different types of gunpowder. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Baitar]], an Arab from Spain who had immigrated to Egypt, described saltpeter as "snow of China" ({{lang-ar|ثلج الصين}} {{transl|ar|DIN|thalj al-ṣīn}}).

Four years after the invasion of 1241, the pope sent an ambassador to the Great Khan's capital in Mongolia. Other travellers followed later, of whom the most interesting was William of Rubruck (or Ruysbroek). He returned in 1257, and in the following year there are reports of experiments with gunpowder and rockets at Cologne. Then a friend of William of Rubruck, Roger Bacon, gave the first account of gunpowder and its use in fireworks to be written in Europe. A form of gunpowder had been known in China since before AD 900, and as mentioned earlier...Much of this knowledge had reached the Islamic countries by then, and the saltpetre used in making gunpowder there was sometimes referred to, significantly, as 'Chinese snow'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier Arab historians called saltpeter "Chinese snow" and " Chinese salt."&lt;ref&gt;Original from the University of Michigan{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZivnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1033|title=The people's cyclopedia of universal knowledge with numerous appendixes invaluable for reference in all departments of industrial life... |volume=Volume 2 of The People's Cyclopedia of Universal Knowledge with Numerous Appendixes Invaluable for Reference in All Departments of Industrial Life|year=1897|publisher=Eaton &amp; Mains |location=New York|page=1033|quote=Fire-arms may be defined as vessels—of whatever form— used in the propulsion of shot, shell, or bullets, to a greater or less distance, by the action of gunpowder exploded within them.

===Europe===
In Europe, [[Roger Bacon]] mentions gunpowder in his ''[[Opus Majus]]'' of 1267.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=25}}

However rockets do not feature in European warfare until the 1380 [[Battle of Chioggia]].{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=516}}

[[Konrad Kyeser]] described rockets in his famous military treatise [[Bellifortis]] around 1405.&lt;ref name="bellifortis"&gt;"Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology", A. Bowdoin Van Riper, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Froissart]] (c. 1337 – c. 1405) had the idea of launching rockets through tubes, so that they could make more accurate flights. Froissart's idea is a forerunner of the modern [[bazooka]].&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

==Adoption in Renaissance-era Europe==
[[File:Conrad Kyeser's Bellifortis c 1405 fig 1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a rocket in Kyeser's ''[[Bellifortis]]'' (1405)]]

According to the 18th-century historian [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]], rockets were used in the [[war of Chioggia|war between the Republics of Genoa and Venice]] at Chioggia in 1380. It is uncertain whether Muratori was correct in his interpretation, as the reference might also have been to [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]], but
Muratori is the source for the widespread claim that the earliest recorded European use of rocket artillery dates to 1380.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, ''Geschichte der Rakete'', 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Konrad Kyeser]] described rockets in his famous military treatise [[Bellifortis]] around 1405.&lt;ref name="bellifortis"/&gt;
Kyeser describes three types of rockets, swimming, free flying and [[Captive plane|captive]].

[[Joanes de Fontana]] in ''Bellicorum instrumentorum liber'' (c. 1420) described flying rockets in the shape of doves, running rockets in the shape of hares, and a large car driven by three rockets, as well as a large rocket torpedo with the head of a sea monster.

In the mid-16th century, [[Conrad Haas]] wrote a book that described rocket technology that combined [[fireworks]] and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the [[Sibiu]] public records (Sibiu public records ''Varia II 374''). His work dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using [[liquid fuel]], and introduced [[delta (letter)|delta]]-shape [[fin]]s and bell-shaped [[nozzle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibiweb.de/vip/haas/ |title=CONRAD HAAS Raketenpionier in Siebenbürgen (german) |publisher=Sibiweb.de |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Rocket'' comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rocchetta'', meaning "bobbin" or "little spindle",&lt;ref&gt;a diminutive of ''rocca'' "[[distaff]]", itself from a [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/rukkô|Germanic source]].&lt;/ref&gt; given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool used to hold the thread to be fed to a spinning wheel. The Italian term was adopted into German in the mid 16th century, by [[Leonhard Fronsperger]] in a book on rocket artillery published in 1557, using the spelling ''rogete'', and by [[Conrad Haas]] as ''rackette''; adoption into English dates to ca. 1610.&lt;ref&gt;English ''rocket'' from c. 1610, adopted from the Italian term. Jim Bernhard, ''Porcupine, Picayune, &amp; Post: How Newspapers Get Their Names'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_oO5fWi6dikC&amp;pg=PA126 p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Schmidlap]], a German fireworks maker, is believed to have experimented with staging in 1590.

==Early modern history==
''Lagari Hasan Çelebi'' was a legendary [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] aviator who, according to an account written by [[Evliya Çelebi]], made a successful manned rocket [[flight]]. Evliya Çelebi purported that in 1633 [[Lagari Hasan Çelebi]] launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5&amp;nbsp;kg, or 140&amp;nbsp;lbs) of [[gunpowder]] from [[Sarayburnu]], the point below [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]].

===Siemienowicz===
"''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima''" ("Great Art of Artillery, the First Part", also known as "The Complete Art of Artillery"), first printed in [[Amsterdam]] in 1650, was translated to [[French language|French]] in 1651, [[German language|German]] in 1676, English and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in 1729 and [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1963. For over two centuries, this work of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[szlachta|nobleman]] [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]]&lt;ref name="Nowak182"&gt;Tadeusz Nowak "''Kazimierz Siemienowicz, ca.1600-ca.1651''", MON Press, [[Warsaw]] 1969, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; was used in Europe as a basic artillery manual. The book provided the standard designs for creating rockets, fireballs, and other [[pyrotechnic]] devices. It contained a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for both military and civil purposes), including [[Multistage rocket|multi-stage]] rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with [[delta wing]] [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|stabilizer]]s (instead of the common guiding rods).

===Indian Mysorean rockets===
[[File:Indian soldier of Tipu Sultan's army.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysorean]] soldier from India, using his [[Mysorean rocket]] as a flagstaff ([[Robert Home]], 1793/4).]]
In 1792, the first [[Mysorean Rockets|iron-cased rockets]] were successfully developed and used by Mysorean rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in [[India]] against the larger [[British East India Company]] forces during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. The British then took an active interest in the technology and developed it further during the 19th century. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than the British had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2&amp;nbsp;km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], which was soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Roddam Narasimha (1985). [http://www.nal.res.in/pdf/pdfrocket.pdf Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750-1850 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303205010/http://www.nal.res.in/pdf/pdfrocket.pdf |date=2012-03-03 }} National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century gunpowder rocket artillery==
[[File:Congreve rockets.gif|thumb|300px|The [[Congreve rocket]]]]
[[William Congreve (inventor)|William Congreve]], son of the Comptroller of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, London, became a major figure in the field. From 1801, Congreve researched on the original design of [[Mysorean Rockets|Mysore rockets]] and set on a vigorous development program at the Arsenal's laboratory.&lt;ref name="congreve"&gt;{{harvnb|Stephens|1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congreve prepared a new propellant mixture, and developed a rocket motor with a strong iron tube with conical nose. This early [[Congreve rocket]] weighed about 32 pounds (14.5 kilograms). The Royal Arsenal's first demonstration of solid fuel rockets was in 1805. The rockets were effectively used during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]]. Congreve published three books on rocketry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Riper|2004}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the use of military rockets spread throughout the western world. At the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in 1814, the rockets fired on [[Fort McHenry]] by the [[rocket vessel]] [[HMS Erebus (1807)|HMS ''Erebus'']] were the source of the ''rockets' red glare'' described by [[Francis Scott Key]] in [[The Star-Spangled Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/5/hh5l.htm British Rockets] at the US National Park Service, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. Retrieved February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockets were also used in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010306020430/http://napoleonic-literature.com/Articles/Rockets/History_of_Rockets.htm History of the Rocket - 1804 to 1815] by Gareth Glover&lt;/ref&gt;

Early rockets were very inaccurate. Without the use of spinning or any controlling [[feedback loop]], rockets had a strong tendency to veer sharply off of their intended course. The early [[Mysorean rockets]] and their successor British [[Congreve rocket]]s&lt;ref name="congreve"/&gt; reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick to the end of a rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) to make it harder for the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5&amp;nbsp;kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting in the center of the rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.

In 1815, [[Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko]] began his work on creating military gunpowder rockets. He constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in salvos (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. Zasyadko elaborated a tactic for military use of rocket weaponry. In 1820, Zasyadko was appointed head of the Petersburg Armory, Okhtensky Powder Factory, pyrotechnic laboratory and the first Highest Artillery School in Russia. He organized rocket production in a special rocket workshop and created the first rocket sub-unit in the Russian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1987/MAF.htm |title=Marine Corps Artillery Rockets: Back Through The Future |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artillery captain [[Józef Bem]] of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] started experiments with what was then called in Polish ''raca kongrewska''. These culminated in his 1819 report ''Notes sur les fusees incendiares'' (German edition: ''Erfahrungen über die Congrevischen Brand-Raketen bis zum Jahre 1819 in der Königlischen Polnischen Artillerie gesammelt'', Weimar 1820). The research took place in the [[Warsaw Arsenal]], where captain Józef Kosiński also developed the multiple-rocket launchers adapted from [[horse artillery]] [[gun carriage]]. The 1st Rocketeer Corps was formed in 1822, it first saw combat during the [[Polish–Russian War 1830–31]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczygielska |first1=Małgorzata |title=Rakietnicy konni Królestwa Polskiego |url=http://www.ksopit.pl/sladami_kopyt/legendarne_formacje_kawalerii/rakietnicy |accessdate=25 March 2016 |language=pl |date=2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy problem was greatly improved in 1844 when [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]]&lt;ref name="SMITH"&gt;{{harvnb|Space History Division|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified the rocket design so that thrust was slightly [[thrust vectoring|vectored]], causing the rocket to spin along its axis of travel like a bullet. The Hale rocket removed the need for a rocket stick, travelled further due to reduced air resistance, and was far more accurate.

In 1865 the British Colonel [[Edward Mounier Boxer]] built an improved version of the Congreve rocket placing two rockets in one tube, one behind the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/iw.history/rockets/dennett.htm|title=John Dennett: Isle of Wight Rocket Man|work=virgin.net|accessdate=7 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823210111/http://freespace.virgin.net/iw.history/rockets/dennett.htm|archivedate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th-century rocket pioneers==
[[File:Tsiolkovsky.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first work on space travel, which was inspired by [[Russian cosmism]] and the writings of [[Jules Verne]].]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the inspiration of fiction by writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]] as well as [[philosophy|philosophical movements]] like [[Russian cosmism]]. Scientists seized on the rocket as a technology that was able to achieve this in real life, a possibility first recognized in 1861 by [[William Leitch (scientist)|William Leitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgpublishing.com/prime/bookpages/9781926837369.html|title=William Leitch Presbyterian Scientist|work=apogeebooks.com|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, high school mathematics teacher [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (1857–1935), inspired by Verne and [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], published ''Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами''&lt;ref&gt;[http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html Tsiolkovsky's Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами - ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'' (Russian paper)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019234511/http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/dorev-knigi/ciolkovskiy/issl-03st.html |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices''), the first serious scientific work on space travel. The [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]—the principle that governs rocket propulsion—is named in his honor (although it had been discovered previously).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1995|pp=499–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated the use of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for propellant, calculating their maximum exhaust velocity. His work was essentially unknown outside the Soviet Union, but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the [[Society for Studies of Interplanetary Travel]] in 1924.

[[File:Robert Esnault-Pelterie 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] (1909).]]
In 1912, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] published a lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esnault-Pelterie|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; on rocket theory and interplanetary travel. He independently derived Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation, did basic calculations about the energy required to make round trips to the Moon and planets, and he proposed the use of atomic power (i.e. radium) to power a jet drive.

[[File:Dr. Robert H. Goddard - GPN-2002-000131.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert H. Goddard|Robert Goddard]]]]
In 1912 [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]], inspired from an early age by H.G. Wells, began a serious analysis of rockets, concluding that conventional solid-fuel rockets needed to be improved in three ways. First, fuel should be burned in a small combustion chamber, instead of building the entire propellant container to withstand the high pressures. Second, rockets could be arranged in stages. Finally, the exhaust speed (and thus the efficiency) could be greatly increased to beyond the speed of sound by using a [[De Laval nozzle]]. He patented these concepts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=1,102,653.PN.&amp;OS=PN/1,102,653&amp;RS=PN/1,102,653 |title=US patent 1,102,653 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date=1914-07-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently developed the mathematics of rocket flight.

During World War I [[Yves Le Prieur]], a French naval officer and inventor, later to create a pioneering [[scuba diving]] apparatus, developed air-to-air solid-fuel rockets. The aim was to destroy observation captive balloons (called saucisses or Drachens) used by German artillery. These rather crude black powder, steel-tipped incendiary rockets (made by [[Ruggieri]]{{clarify |date=January 2018 |reason=unclear which "Ruggeri" we're talking about}}) were first tested from a [[Voisin (aircraft)|Voisin aircraft]], wing-bolted on a fast [[Pic-Pic|Picard Pictet]] sports car and then used in battle on real aircraft. A typical layout was eight electrically fired Le Prieur rockets fitted on the interpane struts of a [[Nieuport]] aircraft. If fired at sufficiently short distance, a spread of [[Le Prieur rocket]]s proved to be quite deadly. Belgian ace Willy Coppens claimed dozens of Drachen kills during World War I.

In 1920, Goddard published these ideas and experimental results in ''[[A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work included remarks about sending a solid-fuel rocket to the Moon, which attracted worldwide attention and was both praised and ridiculed. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested:
: "That Professor Goddard, with his 'chair' in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react -- to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high {{nowrap|schools."{{ns}}—''New York Times'', 13 January 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Topics of the Times |url=http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209230323/http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |publisher=New York Times |date=January 13, 1920 |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]] (1894–1989) published ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' ("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), a version of his doctoral thesis, after the University of Munich had rejected it.&lt;ref name="ianzer"&gt;Jürgen Heinz Ianzer, [http://www.aspera.ro/dl/oberth.pdf ''Hermann Oberth, pǎrintele zborului cosmic''] ("Hermann Oberth, Father of Cosmic Flight") (in Romanian), pp. 3, 11, 13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Tsiolkovsky also wrote about [[multi-stage rocket]]s, in 'Cosmic Rocket Trains'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=inventors |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blrocketTsiolkovsky.htm |title=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - Rockets from Russia |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rocketry==
===Pre-World War II===
[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Goddard and the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]

Modern rockets originated when Goddard attached a supersonic ([[de Laval nozzle|de Laval]]) nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, [[hypersonic]], highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2002|pp=2,15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clary|2003|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1926 Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], Massachusetts.

During the 1920s, a number of rocket research organizations appeared worldwide. In 1927 the German car manufacturer [[Opel]] began to research rocket vehicles together with Mark Valier and the solid-fuel rocket builder Friedrich Wilhelm Sander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/Opel-RAK.html |title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science, history of rocketry: Opel-RAK |publisher=Daviddarling.info|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Fritz von Opel drove a rocket car, the [[Opel-RAK]].1 on the Opel raceway in Rüsselsheim, Germany. In 1928 the [[Lippisch Ente]] flew: rocket power launched the manned glider, although it was destroyed on its second flight. In 1929 von Opel started at the Frankfurt-Rebstock airport with the [[Opel RAK.1|Opel-Sander RAK 1-airplane]], which was damaged beyond repair during a hard landing after its first flight.

In the mid-1920s, [[Weimar Republic|German]] scientists had begun experimenting with rockets that used liquid propellants capable of reaching relatively high altitudes and distances. In 1927 and also in Germany, a team of amateur rocket engineers had formed the ''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' (Society for Space Travel, or VfR), and in 1931 launched a liquid propellant rocket (using [[oxygen]] and [[petrol|gasoline]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/V/Verein_fur_Raumschiffahrt.html |title=History of Rocketry: Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR) |publisher=Daviddarling.info |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocketry in the [[Soviet Union]] also began with amateur societies, foremost was the Group for the Study of Reactive Propulsion (GIRD) headed by [[Friedrich Zander]] and [[Sergei Korolev]]. From 1931 to 1937 in the Soviet Union, extensive scientific work on rocket engine design occurred at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) in [[Leningrad]], which was merged with GIRD in 1933 bringing rocketry fully under government control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Rocketry Takes Flight |last=Gray |first=Dale M|url=http://www.i55mall.com/Frontier/spacepolicyarticles |publisher=Frontier Historical Consultants |access-date=19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-funded and -staffed laboratory built over 100 experimental engines under the direction of [[Valentin Glushko]]. The work included [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]], [[hypergolic propellant]] ignition, and [[fuel injector]] designs that included swirling and bi-propellant mixing injectors. However, Glushko's arrest during [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]] in 1938 curtailed the development.

Similar work was also done from 1932 onwards by the Austrian professor [[Eugen Sänger]], who migrated from Austria to Germany in 1936. He worked there on rocket-powered [[spaceplanes]] such as [[Silbervogel]] (sometimes called the "antipodal" bomber).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/data/saenger.pdf |title=A Rocket Drive For Long Range Bombers by E. Saenger and J. Bredt, August 1944 |format=PDF|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 1932 at a farm in Stockton NJ, the American Interplanetary Society's attempt to static-fire their first rocket (based on German Rocket Society designs) failed in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Winter| first1 = Frank H | last2 = van der Linden| first2 = Robert | title = Out of the Past | magazine = Aerospace America |date = November 2007|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, a British research programme based at [[Fort Halstead]] under the direction of Dr [[Alwyn Crow]] started work on a series of unguided [[solid-fuel rocket]]s that could be used as [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapon]]s. In 1939, a number of test firings were carried out in the [[British colony]] of [[Jamaica]], on a purpose built range.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQPhjvitv5IC&amp;pg=PA42 ''Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War''] Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0141026107}} (p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the German ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (which in 1935 became the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'') began to take an interest in rocketry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaloga|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery restrictions imposed by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] limited Germany's access to long-distance weaponry. Seeing the possibility of using rockets as long-range [[artillery]] fire, the Wehrmacht initially funded the VfR team, but because their focus was strictly scientific, created its own research team. At the behest of military leaders, [[Wernher von Braun]], at the time a young aspiring [[rocket scientist]], joined the military (followed by two former VfR members) and developed long-range weapons for use in [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/a4.html|title=The V-2 ballistic missile |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:V-2 Rocket On Meillerwagen.jpg|thumb|upright|A German V-2 rocket on a [[Meillerwagen]].]]
[[File:V-2 rocket diagram (with English labels).svg|thumb|upright|Layout of a [[V-2 rocket]].]]

At the start of the war, the British had equipped their warships with [[unrotated projectile]] unguided anti-aircraft rockets, and by 1940, the Germans had developed a surface-to-surface [[multiple rocket launcher]], the ''[[Nebelwerfer]]'' and the Soviets already had introduced the [[RS-132]] air-to-ground rocket. All of these rockets were developed for a variety of roles, notably the [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]].

In 1943, production of the [[V-2 rocket]] began in Germany. It had an operational range of {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} and carried a {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} warhead, with an [[amatol]] explosive charge. It normally achieved an operational maximum altitude of around {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}}, but could achieve {{convert|206|km|mi|abbr=on}} if launched vertically. The vehicle was similar to most modern rockets, with [[turbopump]]s, [[guidance system|inertial guidance]] and many other features. Thousands were fired at various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations, mainly Belgium, as well as England and France. While they could not be intercepted, their guidance system design and single conventional warhead meant that they were insufficiently accurate against military targets. A total of 2,754 people in England were killed, and 6,523 were wounded before the launch campaign was ended. There were also 20,000 deaths of slave labour during the construction of V-2s. While it did not significantly affect the course of the war, the V-2 provided a lethal demonstration of the potential for guided rockets as weapons.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1991|pp=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beon&gt;{{harvnb|Béon|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the guided missile programme in [[Nazi Germany]], rockets were also used on aircraft, either for assisting horizontal take-off ([[JATO|RATO]]), vertical take-off ([[Bachem Ba 349]] "Natter") or for powering them ([[Me 163]],&lt;ref name="ww2-planes"&gt;[http://www.world-war-2-planes.com/Messerschmitt-Me-163-Komet.html "Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet."] ''World War 2 Planes''. Retrieved: 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). During the war Germany also developed several guided and unguided air-to-air, ground-to-air and ground-to-ground missiles (see [[list of World War II guided missiles of Germany]]).

At the end of World War II, competing Russian, British, and US military and scientific crews raced to capture technology and trained personnel from the German rocket program at [[Peenemünde]]. Russia and Britain had some success, but the [[United States]] benefited the most. The US captured a large number of German rocket scientists, including von Braun, and brought them to the [[United States]] as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-330-defense-secretary/ |title=Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency.

The V-2 evolved into the American [[Redstone rocket]], used in the early space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Braun|1963|pp=452–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, rockets were used to study high-altitude conditions, by radio [[telemetry]] of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of [[cosmic rays]], and further research; notably the [[Bell X-1]], the first manned vehicle to break the sound barrier. This continued in the US under von Braun and the others, who were destined to become part of the US scientific community.

Independently, in the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union's space program]] research continued under the leadership of the chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=15 |title=International Space Hall of Fame: Sergei Korolev |publisher=Nmspacemuseum.org|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of German technicians, the V-2 was duplicated and improved as the [[R-1 (rocket)|R-1]], [[R-2 rocket|R-2]], and [[R-5 (rocket)|R-5]] missiles. German designs were abandoned in the late 1940s, and the foreign workers were sent home. A new series of engines built by Glushko and based on inventions of [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev]] formed the basis of the first ICBM, the [[R-7 (rocket)|R-7]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url = http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/launchers/rocket-r7.html | title = Rocket R-7 | publisher = S.P.Korolev RSC Energia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-7 launched the first satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], and later [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man into space, and the first lunar and planetary probes. This rocket is still in use today. These prestigious events attracted the attention of top politicians, along with additional funds for further research.

One problem that had not been solved was [[atmospheric reentry]]. It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself, and yet it was known that meteorites can make it down to the ground. The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when [[H. Julian Allen]] and [[Alfred J. Eggers|A. J. Eggers, Jr.]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) permitted the most effective heat shield. With this type of shape, around 99% of the energy goes into the air rather than the vehicle, and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|1987}} [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm Chapter 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allen and Eggers discovery, initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Eggers|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blunt body theory made possible the heat shield designs that were embodied in the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] [[space capsule]]s, enabling astronauts and cosmonauts to survive the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Some [[spaceplane]]s such as the [[Space Shuttle]] made use of the same theory. At the time the [[Space Transportation System|STS]] was being conceived, [[Maxime Faget]], the Director of Engineering and Development at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]], was not satisfied with the purely ''lifting re-entry'' method (as proposed for the cancelled [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 "Dyna-Soar"]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|last2=Jenkins|first2=Dennis R.|title=Coming home: reentry and recovery from space|date=2012|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-16-091064-7|page=x|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/695726main_ComingHome-ebook.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a space shuttle which operated as a blunt body by entering the atmosphere at an extremely high [[angle of attack]] of 40°&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viviani|first1=Antonio|last2=Pezzella|first2=Giuseppe|title=Heat Transfer Analysis for a Winged Reentry Flight Test Bed|journal=International Journal of Engineering (IJE)|date=January 3, 2011|volume=3|issue=3|page=341|citeseerx = 10.1.1.301.9032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the underside facing the direction of flight, creating a large [[Bow shock (aerodynamics)|shock wave]] that would [[Atmospheric entry#Blunt body entry vehicles|deflect most of the heat]] around the vehicle instead of into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|last2=Jenkins|first2=Dennis R.|title=Coming home: reentry and recovery from space|date=2012|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-16-091064-7|page=187|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/695726main_ComingHome-ebook.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Space Shuttle essentially uses a combination of a ''ballistic entry'' (Blunt body theory) and then at an altitude of about {{convert|122,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the re-entry interface takes place.

===Cold War===
[[File:Diamant P6230215.JPG|thumb|French [[Diamant]] rocket, the second French rocket program, developed from 1961&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capcomespace.net/dossiers/espace_europeen/ariane/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Rockets became extremely important militarily as modern [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs) when it was realized that [[nuclear weapons]] carried on a rocket vehicle were essentially impossible for existing defense systems to stop once launched, and launch vehicles such as the R-7, [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] became delivery platforms for these weapons.

[[File:VonBraunTeam1961.jpg|thumb|Von Braun's rocket team in 1961]]
Fueled partly by the [[Cold War]], the 1960s became the decade of rapid development of rocket technology particularly in the Soviet Union ([[Vostok rocket|Vostok]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Proton rocket|Proton]]) and in the [[United States]] (e.g. the [[X-15]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph18.pdf |title=(PDF) '&amp;#39;Hypersonics Before the Shuttle: A Concise History of the X-15 Research Airplane'&amp;#39; (NASA SP-2000-4518, 2000) |format=PDF|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Houchin|2006}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft). There was also significant research in other countries, such as France, Britain, Japan, Australia, etc., and a growing use of rockets for [[Space exploration]], with pictures returned from the far side of the [[Moon]] and unmanned flights for [[Mars exploration]].

In America, the manned spaceflight programs, [[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]], and later the [[Apollo program]], culminated in 1969 with the first manned [[moon landing|landing on the moon]] using the [[Saturn V]], causing the New York Times to retract its earlier editorial implying that spaceflight couldn't work:

{{Quotation|Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.|New York Times, 17 June 1969 - A Correction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuntz |first=Tom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-the-facts-that-got-away.html |title=New York Times 17 June 1969 - A Correction |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2001-11-14 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1970s, the United States made five more lunar landings before cancelling the [[Apollo program]] in 1975. The replacement vehicle, the partially reusable [[Space Shuttle]], was intended to be cheaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GAO|1972}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no large reduction in costs was achieved. Meanwhile, in 1973, the expendable [[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]] programme was begun, a launcher that by the year 2000 would capture much of the [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosat]] market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2517">In computing, '''hyperscale''' is the ability of an architecture to scale appropriately as increased demand is added to the system.  This typically involves the ability to seamlessly provision and add compute, memory, networking, and storage resources to a given node or set of nodes that make up a larger [[computing]], [[distributed computing]], or [[grid computing]] environment.  Hyperscale computing is necessary in order to build a robust and scalable [[Cloud Computing|cloud]], [[Big Data|big data]], [[MapReduce|map reduce]], or [[Clustered file system|distributed storage]] system and is often associated with the infrastructure required to run large distributed sites such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Rich|title=A Hyper-Scale Cloud Data Center, Seen From the Clouds|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/11/06/facebook-lulea-aerial-view/|publisher=Data Center Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Google]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Data Centers|url=https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Expands Its Hyperscale Cloud Footprint|url=http://www.eweek.com/cloud/microsoft-expands-its-hyperscale-cloud-footprint.html|publisher=eweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Furrier|first=John|title=Fusion-io Launched New Hyperscale Flash Product to Scale Data Centers for Enterprises, Not Just Facebook|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/01/17/fusion-io-launched-new-hyperscale-flash-product-to-scale-data-centers-for-enterprises-not-just-facebook/|publisher=Silicon Angle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|title=Definition: Hyperscale Computing|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hyperscale-computing|publisher=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/data-mgmt|title=Data Management {{!}} Oracle Cloud|website=cloud.oracle.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''ISO 216''' specifies [[International Organization for Standardization|international standard]] (ISO) [[paper size]]s used in most countries in the world today, although not in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, or the Dominican Republic. The standard defines the "'''A'''" and "'''B'''" series of paper sizes, including '''A4''', the most commonly available paper size worldwide. Two supplementary standards, [[ISO 217]] and [[ISO 269]], define related paper sizes; the '''ISO 269''' "'''C'''" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.

All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same [[aspect ratio]], [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]:1,  within rounding to [[millimetres]]. This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthways, the halves also have the same aspect ratio.

{{Redirects|Lichtenberg ratio|{{sqrt|2}}|Square root of 2}}

In 1786, the German scientist [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] described the advantages of basing a paper size on an [[aspect ratio]] of {{sqrt|2}} in a letter to [[Johann Beckmann]].&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The formats that became ISO paper sizes A2, A3, B3, B4, and B5 were developed in France. They were listed in a 1798 law on taxation of publications that was based in part on page sizes.&lt;ref name="B237"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Comparison_paper_sizes.svg|thumb|Comparison of A4 (shaded grey) and C4 sizes with some similar paper and photographic paper sizes.]]

The main advantage of this system is its scaling. [[Rectangle|Rectangular]] paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} has the unique property that, when cut or folded in half midway between its shorter sides, each half has the same {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio and half the [[area]] of the whole sheet before it was divided. Equivalently, if one lays two same-sized sheets paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} side-by-side along their longer side, they form a larger rectangle with the aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} and double the area of each individual sheet.

The ISO system of paper sizes exploit these properties of the {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio. In each series of sizes (for example, series A), the largest size is numbered 0 (for example, A0), and each successive size (for example, A1, A2, etc.) has half the area of the preceding sheet and can be cut by halving the length of the preceding size sheet. The new measurement is rounded down to the nearest millimetre.  A folded [[brochure]] can be made by using a sheet of the next larger size (for example, an A4 sheet is folded in half to make a brochure with size A5 pages. An office [[photocopier]] or printer can be designed to reduce a page from A4 to A5 or to enlarge a page from A4 to A3. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down to fit one A4 sheet without excess empty paper.

This system also simplifies calculating the weight of paper. Under [[ISO 536]], paper's [[grammage]] is defined as a sheet's weight in [[gram]]s (g) per area in [[square metre]]s (abbreviated g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or gsm).&lt;ref name="ISO 536"&gt;{{Cite web
|author=International Organization for Standardization |author-link=International Organization for Standardization
|title=ISO 536:2012(en): Paper and board — Determination of grammage
|edition=3 |at=§&amp;nbsp; 3.1 note 1.
|work=ISO Browsing Platform
|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since an A0 sheet has an area of 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, its weight in grams is the same as its grammage. One can derive the grammage of other sizes by [[Division  (mathematics)|arithmetic division]] in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A standard A4 sheet made from 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; paper weighs 5&amp;nbsp;g, as it is {{sfrac|1|16}} (four halvings, ignoring rounding) of an A0 page. Thus the weight, and the associated postage rate, can be easily approximated by counting the number of sheets used.

ISO 216 and its related standards were first published between 1975 and 1995:
* ISO 216:2007, defining the A and B series of paper sizes
* ISO 269:1985, defining the C series for envelopes
* ISO 217:2013, defining the RA and SRA series of raw ("untrimmed") paper sizes

==A series==

Paper in the A series format has an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} (≈ 1.414, when ignoring rounding). A0 is defined so that it has an area of 1 [[square metre]] before rounding to the nearest millimeter. Successive paper sizes in the series (A1, A2, A3, etc.) are defined by halving the length of the preceding paper size and rounding down, so that the long side of A(''n''+1) is the same length as the short side of A''n''. Hence, each next size is roughly half of the prior size. So, an A1 page can fit 2 A2 pages inside the same area.

The most used of this series is the size A4, which is {{cvt|210|x|297|mm |sigfig=3}} and thus almost exactly {{convert|0.0625|m2|sqin}} in area. For comparison, the [[Letter (paper size)|letter]] paper size commonly used in North America ({{convert|8+1/2|x|11|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) is about 6&amp;nbsp;mm (0.24&amp;nbsp;in) wider and 18&amp;nbsp;mm (0.71&amp;nbsp;in) shorter than A4. Then, the size of A5 paper is half of A4, as 148&amp;nbsp;x 210&amp;nbsp;mm (5.8 x 8.3&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= A Paper Sizes - A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9 |date= |url= https://www.papersizes.org/a-paper-sizes.htm |website= papersizes.org |accessdate= 2018-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= International Paper Sizes, Dimensions, Format &amp; Standards |date= |url= https://papersize.co/ |website= PaperSize |accessdate= 2018-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric rationale behind the [[square root of 2]] is to maintain the aspect ratio of each subsequent rectangle after cutting or folding an A-series sheet in half, perpendicular to the larger side.  Given a rectangle with a longer side, {{math|''x''}}, and a shorter side, {{math|''y''}}, ensuring that its aspect ratio, {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}, will be the same as that of a rectangle half its size, {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which means that {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which reduces to {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sqrt|2}}}}; in other words, an aspect ratio of 1:{{sqrt|2}}.

The formula that gives the larger border of the paper size A''n'' in metres and without rounding off is the [[geometric sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 2^{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{n}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The paper size A''n'' thus has the dimension
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n} \times a_{n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
and area (before rounding)
:&lt;math&gt;2^{-n}~\mathrm{m}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of A''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{2n - 1}{4}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
(brackets represent the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] function).

==B series==
The B series is defined in the standard as follows: "A subsidiary series of sizes is obtained by placing the [[Geometric mean|geometrical means]] between adjacent sizes of the A series in sequence." The use of the geometric mean  makes each step in size: B0, A0, B1, A1, B2 &amp;hellip;  smaller than the previous one by the same factor. As with the A series, the lengths of the B series have the ratio {{sqrt|2}}, and folding one in half (and rounding down to the nearest millimeter) gives the next in the series. The shorter side of B0 is exactly 1 metre.

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of B''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{n - 1}{2}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also an incompatible Japanese B series which the [[Japanese Industrial Standard|JIS]] defines to have 1.5 times the area of the corresponding JIS A series (which is identical to the ISO A series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paper-sizes.com/uncommon-paper-sizes/japanese-b-series-paper-size|title=Japanese B Series Paper Size|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the lengths of JIS B series paper are {{sqrt|1.5}} ≈ 1.22 times those of A-series paper. By comparison, the lengths of ISO B series paper are {{sqrt|2|4}} ≈ 1.19 times those of A-series paper.

==C series==
The C series formats are  geometric means between the B series and A series formats with the same number (e.g., C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2). The width to height ratio is {{sqrt|2}} as in the A and B series. The C series formats are used mainly for [[envelope]]s. An A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope. C series envelopes follow the same ratio principle as the A series pages. For example, if an A4 page is folded in half so that it is A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half). The lengths of ISO C series paper are therefore {{sqrt|2|8}} ≈ 1.09 times those of A-series paper.

A, B, and C paper fit together as part of a [[geometric progression]], with ratio of successive side lengths of {{sqrt|2|8}}, though there is no size half-way between B''n'' and A(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1): A4, C4, B4, "D4", A3, …; there is such a D-series in the [[Paper size#Swedish extensions|Swedish extensions]] to the system.

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of C''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{4n - 3}{8}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

==Tolerances==
The tolerances specified in the standard are:
* [[±]]1.5&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm,
* ±2.0&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions in the range 150 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm, and
* ±3.0&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions above 600&amp;nbsp;mm.

These are related to comparison between series A, B and C.

==Application==

The ISO 216 formats are organized around the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}}; two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio, sideways.  In scaled photocopying, for example, two A4 sheets reduced to A5 size fit exactly onto one A4 sheet, and an A4 sheet in magnified size onto an A3 sheet; in each case, there is neither waste nor want.

The principal countries not generally using the ISO paper sizes are the United States and Canada, which use the [[Paper size#Loose sizes|Letter, Legal and Executive system]].  Although they have also officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. paper sizes.

[[Rectangle|Rectangular]] sheets of paper with the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}} are popular in [[paper folding]], such as [[mathematics of paper folding|origami]], where they are sometimes called "A4 rectangles" or "silver rectangles".&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorigami.info/academic/lister/a4.php|title=The A4 rectangle|last=Lister|first=David|work=The Lister List|publisher=British Origami Society|location=England|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other contexts, the term "silver rectangle" can also refer to a rectangle in the proportion 1:(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}), known as the [[silver ratio]].

==Matching technical pen widths==
An important adjunct to the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in [[ISO 128]], and the matching technical pen widths of 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm, as specified in [[:de:ISO 9175-1|ISO 9175-1]]. Color codes are assigned to each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. These sizes increase by a factor of {{sqrt|2}}, so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a continuous thick line on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35&amp;nbsp;mm pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html|title=International standard paper sizes|last1=Kuhn|first1=Markus|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Technical_drawing_pen_sizes|title=Technical drawing pen sizes|website=Designing Buildings Wiki|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrication.com/drafting/lines.html|title=Pen Sizes and Line Types|last1=Bell|first1=Steven|website=Metrication.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier [[DIN 6775]] standard upon which ISO 9175-1 is based also specified a term and symbol for easy identification of pens and drawing templates compatible with the standard, called [[:fr:micronorm|Micronorm]], which may still be found on some technical drafting equipment.

[[Liquefied natural gas]] ([[LNG]]) is the liquefied form of natural gas, which has a much smaller volume than natural gas in its gaseous form. This liquefied condition is used to facilitate the carriage of [[natural gas]] over long distances, often by sea, in specialized tanks. 

LNG port terminals are purpose-built port terminals designed to accommodate large [[LNG carrier]] ships designed to load, carry and unload  [[LNG]]. These LNG terminals are located adjacent to a gas liquefaction and storage plant (export), or to a gas regasification and storage plant (import), which are themselves connected to gas pipelines connected to on-shore or off-shore gas fields (export) or to storage and distribution plants (import).

To be included, the outage must conform to these criteria:
#The shortage must not be planned by the service provider.
#The shortage must affect at least 1,000 people ''and'' last at least one hour.
#There must be at least 1,000,000 person*customer hours of disruption.

In other words:
* 1,000 people affected for 1,000 hours (42 days) minimum, but if fewer than 1,000 people, event would not be included (regardless of duration)
* One million people affected for a minimum of one hour, but if duration is less than one hour, event would not be included (regardless of number of people)
* For example, 10,000 people affected for 100 hours ''or'' 100,000 for 10 hours would be included

'''Local eGovernment''' is [[eGovernment]] as it relates to [[local government]], police, fire, national park and transport authorities.

== Local eGovernment in England ==
The [[UK government]]’s objective was that all of public services in [[England]] should be capable of being delivered electronically by 31 December 2005. The ''Modernising Government'' White Paper of March 1999 proposed "all dealings with government being deliverable electronically by 2008." Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] then announced on 30 March 2000 that the target date had been brought forward from 2008 to 2005.

Electronic delivery is defined as delivery through internet protocols and other ICT methods and includes delivery by telephone if the officer receiving the call can access electronic information and/or update records online there and then.

The average local authority achieved a reported 97% e-enablement by 31 December 2005, though it is suspected the actual figure is much lower.  The target also applied to the Civil Service, which achieved a reported 96%.

=== Objectives and performance management ===
==== Implementing Electronic Government (IEG) Statements ====
From December 2001 to April 2006 local authorities were required to publish an ''IEG Statement'' on their degree of e-enablement (electronic enablement). The measures include BVPI 157 and the Priority Outcomes.

==== Best Value Performance Indicator (BVPI) 157 ====
BVPI 157 measures the percentage of 'interactions' provided by a local authority that are e-enabled. The figure must be published annually as part of the Best Value performance management framework. The figure is calculated by considering the following ten types of interaction as they apply to the services provided by the local authority:
*providing information
*collecting revenue
*providing benefits and grants
*consultation
*regulation (such as issuing licences)
*applications for services
*booking venues, resources and courses
*paying for goods and services
*providing access to community, professional or business networks
*procurement
Local authorities may use a proprietary list of services, but are required to validate their list against the ''Local Government Services List'' (LGSL).
BVPI 157 forms part of the annual IEG statement.

==== Priority Outcomes ====
To guide local authorities in implementing eGovernment, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (and its successor the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)) issued a list of key targets, most commonly referred to as the Priority Outcomes or PSOs (Priority Service Outcomes). The list was issued in the snappily entitled document ''Defining E-government Outcomes for 2005 to Support the Delivery of Priority Services &amp; National Strategy Transformation Agenda for Local Authorities in England – Version 1.0''.
In September 2004, detailed guidance on the Priority Outcomes was issued in the document ''Priority Outcomes - Explanatory Notes for Practitioners'', published  by the IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency) and endorsed by the ODPM.

Priority Outcomes are rated with three levels of obligation:
*''Required'' = To be implemented (available for use) by Dec 2005
*''Good'' = To be approved for funding and being actively implemented by Dec 2005 and implemented by April 1, 2006
*''Excellent'' = Voluntary for authorities that have implemented required and good outcomes early.

The following technologies are recommended in Priority Outcomes: Explanatory Notes for Practitioners as those likely to be essential in the achievement of the Priority Outcomes:
*[[Customer relationship management]] system:
**Customer database (single view of info on each customer, citizen and business)
**Customer tracking (across access channels and from contact to resolution)
**Data warehousing (central repository for data, including legacy data)
*[[Middleware]] and [[web services]] (manages flow of data between all systems, including external)
*[[Document management system]]:
**Workflow, messaging and e-forms (gets work to the right people at the right time)
**Document and records management (e-storage of all documents and info)
*[[Content management]] (system for publishing of content to all access channels)
*Security, [[authentication]] and [[smartcard]]s (for security of information)
*e-Payments (system for receiving payments to the council)
*[[e-procurement|e-Procurement]] (system for internal/external buying processes)
*[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) (access to geographical data through maps)
*Local land and property gazetteer (database of land and property information)
*Access channels (websites, call centres, [[internet kiosk|kiosks]], [[digital TV]], mobile phones, etc.)

==== Socitm Insight Better Connected reports ====
Local authority websites are also subject to assessments by Socitm (Society of Information Technology Management) Insight in their annual ''Better Connected'' reports.

[[File:Luddite.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Leader of the Luddites'', engraving of 1812]]

The '''Luddites''' were a secret oath-based organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebaffler.com/latest/a-nod-to-ned-ludd|title=A nod to Ned Ludd|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[England|English]] textile workers in the 19th century, where a radical faction destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The group was protesting the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?no-ist=&amp;page=2|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Luddites feared correctly that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/who-were-the-luddites|title=Who were the Luddites? |newspaper=History.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a misconception that the Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt the progress of technology. Over time, however, the term has come to mean one opposed to [[industrialisation]], [[automation]], [[embedded computer system|computerisation,]] or new [[technology|technologies]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict&amp;field-12668446=luddite&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname "Luddite"] ''Compact Oxford English Dictionary'' at AskOxford.com. Accessed February 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Luddite movement began in [[Nottingham]] and culminated in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed with military force.

== Etymology ==

Although the origin of the name Luddite ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|d|.|aɪ|t}}) is uncertain, the movement was said to be named after [[Ned Ludd]], an apprentice who allegedly smashed two [[stocking frame]]s in 1779 and whose name had become emblematic of machine destroyers. Ned Ludd, however, was completely fictional and used as a way to shock and provoke the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205162901/http://www.leicesteruk.net/historydetail.php?id=13322&amp;f= Anstey at Welcome to Leicester (visitoruk.com)] According to this source, "A half-witted Anstey lad, Ned Ludlam or Ned Ludd, gave his name to the Luddites, who in the 1800s followed his earlier example by expressing violence against machinery in protest against the Industrial Revolution."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Roy, 1998, ''The Sound of History: Songs and Social Comment'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-215890-1}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;Chambers, Robert (2004), ''Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Part 1'', Kessinger, {{ISBN|978-0-7661-8338-4}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The name evolved into the imaginary General Ludd or King Ludd, who, like [[Robin Hood]], was reputed to live in [[Sherwood Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/politics/g3/ |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=19 August 2011 |title=The National Archives Learning Curve &amp;#124; Power, Politics and Protest &amp;#124; the Luddites}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] has called their machine wrecking "[[collective bargaining]] by riot", which had been a tactic used in Britain since the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as the scattering of manufactories throughout the country made large-scale strikes impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libcom.org/history/machine-breakers-eric-hobsbawm |author= Hobsbawm, Eric |title= 'The Machine Breakers', Past and Present 1 (1952), 57–70 |publisher= Libcom.org |date= 2009-07-04 |accessdate= 2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ-www.mit.edu"&gt;Author, Frank; Levy, David and Murnane, Richard J.

== Historical precedents ==

The lower classes of the 18th century, generally speaking, were not openly disloyal to the king or government.&lt;ref name="Wearmouth1945"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Featherstone Wearmouth|title=Methodism and the common people of the eighteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1w3AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 April 2013|year=1945|publisher=Epworth Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, violent action was rare because punishments were harsh. The majority of individuals were primarily concerned with meeting their own daily needs.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Wearmouth, ''Methodism and the Common People of the Eighteenth Century''. (1945), esp. chs. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement towards aggression in the 19th century can be seen as part of the rise in English working-class discontent due to the Industrial Revolution. Working conditions in the mills were harsh but efficient enough to threaten the livelihoods of skilled artisans. The new inventions allowed for faster and cheaper labour because machines were operated by less-skilled, low-wage labourers. The Luddites were not afraid of technology and did not attempt to eliminate technology out of fear. Their goal was instead to gain a better bargaining position with their employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merchant|first1=Brian|title=You've Got Luddites All Wrong|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/luddites-definition-wrong-labor-technophobe|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luddism was in fact a prototypical, insurrectionary labour movement involving a loose coalition of dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/luddites-definition-wrong-labor-technophobe|title=You've Got Luddites All Wrong|newspaper=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Kevin Binfield and others asserts that since organized action by [[stockinger (occupation)|stockingers]] had occurred at various times since 1675, the movements of the early 19th century must be viewed in the context of the hardships suffered by the working class during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], rather than as an absolute aversion to machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binfield|first=Kevin|title=Luddites and Luddism|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rude|first=George|title=The Crowd in History: A Study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730–1848|year=2001|publisher=Serif}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomis/&gt; Irregular rises in food prices provoked [[Keelmen|the Keelmen]] working in the [[port of Tyne]] to riot in 1710&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43320 |title=Historical events  – 1685–1782 &amp;#124; Historical Account of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (pp. 47–65) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tin miners to steal from granaries at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1727. There was a rebellion in [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1740, and the assault of Quaker corn dealers in 1756. Skilled artisans in the cloth, building, shipbuilding, printing and cutlery trades organized friendly societies to peacefully insure themselves against unemployment, sickness, and in some cases against intrusion of "foreign" labour into their trades, as was common among guilds.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"&gt;Charles Wilson, England's Apprenticeship, 1603-1763 (1965), pp. 344–45. PRO, SP 36/4/22.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| The Falmouth magistrates reported to the Duke of Newcastle (16 Nov. 1727) that "the unruly tinners" had "broke open and plundered several cellars and granaries of corn." Their report concludes with a comment that suggests that they were no more able than some modern historians to understand the rationale of the direct action of the tinners: "the occasion of these outrages was pretended by the rioters to be a scarcity of corn in the county, but this suggestion is probably false, as most of those who carried off the corn gave it away or sold it at quarter price." PRO, SP 36/4/22.}}

Malcolm L. Thomis argued in his 1970 history, ''The Luddites'', that without the structure of a union, machine-breaking was one of very few mechanisms workers could use to increase pressure on employers, to undermine lower-paid competing workers and to create solidarity among workers, "These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made."&lt;ref name="thomis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomis|first=Malcolm|title=The Luddites: Machine Breaking in Regency England|year=1970|publisher=Shocken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agricultural variant of Luddism, centering on the breaking of threshing machines, occurred during the widespread [[Swing Riots]] of 1830 in southern and eastern England.&lt;ref name="harrison249"&gt;Harrison. The Common People. pp. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth of the movement ==
:''See also [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]], whose sewing machines were destroyed by tailors who believed that their jobs were threatened''

The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which saw a rise of difficult working conditions in the new textile factories. Luddites objected primarily to the rising popularity of automated textile equipment, threatening the jobs and livelihoods of skilled workers as this technology allowed them to be replaced by cheaper and less skilled workers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?all|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|last=Conniff|first=Richard|newspaper=Smithsonian|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement began in [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], [[Nottingham]] on 11 March 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beckett|first1=John|title=Luddites|url=http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/people/luddites.htm|website=The Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway|publisher=[[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire]]|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conniff&gt;{{cite web|last=Conniff|first=Richard|title=What the Luddites Really Fought Against|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/What-the-Luddites-Really-Fought-Against.html?c=y&amp;page=2|work=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loom#Handloom|Handloom]] weavers burned mills and pieces of factory machinery. Textile workers destroyed industrial equipment during the late 18th century,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; prompting acts such as the [[Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788]].

The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns to practice drills and maneuvers.

They smashed [[stocking frame]]s and cropping frames among others. There does not seem to have been any political motivation behind the Luddite riots and there was no national organization.

In 1817, an unemployed Nottingham [[stockinger (occupation)|stockinger]] and probably ex-Luddite, named [[Jeremiah Brandreth]] led the [[Pentrich Rising]]. While this was a general uprising unrelated to machinery, it can be viewed as the last major Luddite act.

== Government response ==

The [[British Army]] clashed with the Luddites on several occasions. At one time there were more British soldiers fighting the Luddites than there were fighting [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm, Eric]] (1964) "The Machine Breakers" in ''Labouring Men. Studies in the History of Labour.'', London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| Hobsbawm has popularized this comparison and refers to the original statement in [[Frank Ongley Darvall]] (1969) ''Popular Disturbances and Public Order in Regency England'', London, Oxford University Press, p. 260.}} Three Luddites, led by George Mellor, ambushed and assassinated mill owner William Horsfall of Ottiwells Mill in [[Marsden, West Yorkshire]] at [[Crosland Moor]] in [[Huddersfield]]. Horsfall had remarked that he would "Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=Horsfall++%22Ride+up+to+his+saddle+in+Luddite+blood.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q1ZRIoshVP&amp;sig=jiXoHzguYZ07yXCvzbLC6q1qf84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_ePGhO_QAhXBwiYKHZ1eCYQQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Horsfall%20%20%22Ride%20up%20to%20his%20saddle%20in%20Luddite%20blood.%22&amp;f=false|title=Grim Almanac of York|last=Sharp|first=Alan|date=2015-05-04|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780750964562|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall's groin, and all three men were arrested.

[[Lord Byron]] denounced what he considered to be the plight of the working class, the government’s inane policies and ruthless repression in the [[House of Lords]] on 27 February 1812: "I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of [[Turkey]]; but never, under the most despotic of infidel governments, did I behold such squalid wretchedness as I have seen since my return, in the very heart of a Christian country."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron, Debate on the 1812 Framework Bill, [[Hansard]], http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1812/feb/27/frame-work-bill#S1V0021P0_18120227_HOL_7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British government]] sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at [[York]] in January 1813, following the attack on Cartwrights mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton. The government charged over 60 men, including Mellor and his companions, with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities. While some of those charged were actual Luddites, many had no connection to the movement. Although the proceedings were legitimate jury trials, many were abandoned due to lack of evidence and 30 men were acquitted. These trials were certainly intended to act as [[show trials]] to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities. The harsh sentences of those found guilty, which included [[execution]] and [[penal transportation]], quickly ended the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/people/luddites.html#link4 |title=Luddites in Marsden: Trials at York |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326170835/http://www.marsdenhistory.co.uk/people/luddites.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Gaskell: The Life of Charlotte Bronte, Vol. 1, Ch. 6, for contemporaneous description of attack on Cartwright.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
{{anchor|In retrospect}}
In 1867 [[Karl Marx]] wrote that it would be some time before workers were able to distinguish between the machines and "the form of society which utilizes these instruments" and their ideas. "The instrument of labour, when it takes the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm#S5 Karl Marx, Capital Vol. I, Ch. 15, Sect. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, occupations that arose from the growth of trade and shipping in ports, also in 'domestic' manufacturers, were notorious for precarious employment prospects. Underemployment was chronic during this period,&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt; and it was common practice to retain a larger workforce than was typically necessary for insurance against labour shortages in boom times.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt;

Moreover, the organization of manufacture by merchant-capitalists in the textile industry was inherently unstable. While the financiers' capital was still largely invested in raw material, it was easy to increase commitment where trade was good and almost as easy to cut back when times were bad. Merchant-capitalists lacked the incentive of later factory owners, whose capital was invested in building and plants, to maintain a steady rate of production and return on fixed capital. The combination of seasonal variations in wage rates and violent short-term fluctuations springing from harvests and war, periodic outbreaks of violence are more easily understood.&lt;ref name="Charles Wilson 1965 p. 344-5"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==

In 1956, a speech said that "organized workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy."{{sfn|Sale|1995|p = 205}} More recently, the term [[Neo-Luddism]] has emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jones  | first = Steve E.  | title = Against technology: from the Luddites to neo-Luddism  | publisher = CRC Press   | year = 2006  | location =   | page = 20  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YwPP4pGRAwgC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-97868-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress (April 1996; Barnesville, Ohio), Neo-Luddism is "a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age."&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America's new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “[[Luddite fallacy]]” is used by economists in reference to the fear that [[technological unemployment]] inevitably generates [[structural unemployment]] and is consequently macroeconomically injurious. If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1 = Jerome | first1 = Harry | author1-link = | title = Mechanization in Industry, National Bureau of Economic Research | year = 1934 | url = http://papers.nber.org/books/jero34-1 | pages = 32–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">The '''MIT Center for Collective Intelligence'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cci.mit.edu MIT Center for Collective Intelligence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ('''CCI''') is a research center at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], headed by Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]], that focuses on the study of [[collective intelligence]].  

The Center for Collective Intelligence brings together faculty from across MIT to conduct research on how new communications technologies are changing the way people work together. It involves people from many diverse organizations across MIT including; the [[MIT Media Lab]], the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], and the Dalai Lama Center for 21st Century Ethics and Transformative Values.  

== History and mission ==
CCI was founded in 2006 by professor [[Thomas W. Malone]]. To a great extent, this is a continuation of the research Malone and his colleagues have conducted at the Center for Coordination Science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/8836 MIT looks to give 'group think' a good name&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as within initiatives such as "Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century".

The center's mission is to find novel answers to one basic research motif: "How can people and computers be connected so that—collectively—they act more intelligently than any individuals, groups, or computers have ever done before?'"

In order to answer this question, the researchers conduct three types of research: 
# Collecting examples and case studies of collective intelligence applications.
# Creating new examples and tools that harness the collective intelligence of people
# Systematic studies and experiments

Finally, they also work on developing theories to explain the phenomena of collective-intelligence.

The center is sponsored by several corporates and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://cci.mit.edu/about/sponsors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]] is the founder and director of CCI. In addition to Malone, the faculty steering committee includes: 
Professor [[Randall Davis]] (Research Director, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), [[Alex (Sandy) Pentland]] (Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Science and Director, Human Dynamics Group at the Media Laboratory), and [[Josh Tenenbaum]] - Paul E. Newton Associate Professor and Head, Computational Cognitive Science Group (Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences).

The advisory board includes [[Tim Berners-Lee]], [[Jimmy Wales]] and Alpheus Bingham (former CEO of [[Innocentive|Innocentive, Inc.]]).
The center also has an active community of research scientists, students, scholars and other affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[mobile phone]]s in school settings or environments is a topic of debate. 
Supporting parents believe that cell phones address their safety concerns by enabling them to communicate with their children.

A study of a group of [[undergraduate student]]s, published in the journal ''[[Computers in Human Behavior]]'' in 2015, found that among undergraduate students, total mobile-phone use (measured in number of minutes per day, not limited to school time) was "a significant and negative predictor of college students' academic performance, objectively measured as cumulative GPA." The study [[Controlling for a variable|controlled for]] various other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/5/1/2158244015573169 |title=The Relationship Between Cell Phone Use and Academic Performance in a Sample of U.S. College Students |author1=Andrew Lepp |author2=Jacob E.

A 2015 study by the [[London School of Economics]], conducted in four cities of England, found that test scores increased by more than 6% in schools which banned cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-32771253 |title=Mobile phone bans 'improve school exam results' |publisher=BBC News |date=17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers [[Julia Irwin]] and Natasha Gupta of [[Macquarie University]] performed an experiment in 2016 testing the effect of [[Facebook]] distractions in the classroom. The study found that students interested in the subject material and the way it was presented were less likely to be distracted by Facebook, however, those same students with access to phones still performed lower than students that were not allowed access to cell phones during the lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Natasha|last2=Irwin|first2=Julia D.|title=In-class distractions: The role of Facebook and the primary learning task|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563214005457|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=55|pages=1165–1178|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 collective study published by ''[[Applied Cognitive Psychology]]'', found that college students retained less knowledge when allowed to use or have a cell phone on them during lectures. During the experiment, students that were not allowed access to a cell phone tested better than students that had access to cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Seungyeon|last2=Kim|first2=Myeong W.|last3=McDonough|first3=Ian M.|last4=Mendoza|first4=Jessica S.|last5=Kim|first5=Min Sung|date=2017-05-01|title=The Effects of Cell Phone Use and Emotion-regulation Style on College Students' Learning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3323/abstract|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=360–366|doi=10.1002/acp.3323|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the numerous drawbacks that come with the use of cellphones in classrooms, there are also exist certain benefits. A 2017 study conducted by Dr. James Derounian at the University of Gloucestershire involving 100 participants revealed that 45% of students believe that the use of phones in classrooms supports their education. One of the most common strengths listed was the use of phones for accessing digital textbook and thus engaging deeper with the material presented. However, Derounian mentioned that there could be "an element of social desirability conveyed in the student views given".&lt;ref&gt;Derounian, James Garo. "Mobiles in class?"&amp;nbsp;Active Learning in Higher Education, 2017, p. 146978741774521., doi:10.1177/1469787417745214.
&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by Emma Henderson for the ''Independent'' in the UK goes over "phantom vibrations" caused by "learned bodily behavior". The part of the body the phone is close to becomes very sensitive and the slightest vibration can cause a person to believe the phone has vibrated, hence the name "phantom vibration". 9 out of 10 people have claimed to have felt their mobile device vibrate while in the pocket when it in fact did not. It can be beneficial for students not only out of respect for the professor to have their mobile phones out of their pockets but also to themselves to help break this cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/phantom-vibration-syndrome-up-to-90-per-cent-of-people-suffer-phenomenon-while-mobile-phone-is-in-a6804631.html|title=Most people suffer from ‘phantom vibration syndrome’|date=2016-01-10|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
In the [[United Kingdom]], no schools banned mobile phones in 2001. However, by 2007, 50% of the schools had banned these devices, and by 2012, this number had increased to 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results |title=Schools that ban mobile phones see better academic results |author=Jamie Doward |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''CNN Money'', students' academic skills improved when policies were implemented to ban cell phone use in schools. Schools banning students from carrying phones helped students score higher on [[exams]] and reduced the students' temptations to use cell phones for non-[[scholarly]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ivana Kottasova|title=Kids do a lot better when schools ban smartphones|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/18/technology/smartphones-schools-ban/|accessdate=10 March 2016|publisher=CNNMoney (London)|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the past, some U.S. schools have installed [[mobile phone jammer]]s to prevent mobile phones from working on campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mary Ann Bell |author2=Holly Weimar |author3=James Van Roekel |title=School Librarians and the Technology Department: A Practical Guide to Successful Collaboration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbxdAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 |date=23 May 2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-58683-540-8 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale and use of jammers is illegal in the U.S. under the federal [[Communications Act of 1934]], because jammers cut off [[9-1-1]] calls and can disrupt [[air navigation]] near airports, and in 2012 the [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) stepped up enforcement of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Koebler, [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/10/17/fcc-cracks-down-on-cell-phone-jammers FCC Cracks Down on Cell Phone 'Jammers'], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (October 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mt. Spokane High School]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state at one point installed a jammer in school to prevent  students from calling and text-messaging, but removed the device after determining that it was "probably not legal" under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khq.com/story/9980952/school-scraps-cell-phone-jammer-program School scraps cell phone jammer program], [[KHQ-TV]] (undated).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, one [[Florida]] science teacher received a five-day unpaid suspension for installing a jammer in his classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://abc7chicago.com/education/teacher-suspended-for-jamming-students-cellphones/764005/ Teacher suspended for jamming students' cellphones] (June 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[New York City Department of Education]] imposed a citywide ban on mobile phones in public schools.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Kate Taylor, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/nyregion/ban-on-cellphones-in-new-york-city-schools-to-be-lifted.html Ban on Cellphones in New York City Schools to Be Lifted], ''New York Times'' (January 6, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', the ban was "inconsistently enforced, with some schools allowing students to carry phones as long as staff members do not hear or see them, and other schools—particularly those with [[metal detector]]s at the doors—maintaining a strict ban. Outside those schools, small businesses have sprung up that allow students to park their phones inside a truck for a dollar a day."&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; The ban was unpopular among parents because it impeded communication with children.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; In March 2015, the citywide ban was lifted,&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"&gt;Edgar Sandoval, Dale Eisinger &amp; Reuven Blau, [http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dept-education-ends-cell-phone-ban-nyc-schools-article-1.2134970 Department of Education lifts ban on cell phones in New York City schools], ''New York Daily News'' (March 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling a campaign promise made by Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Under the new policy, [[school principal]]s (in consultation with teachers and parents) may set rules on use and storage of mobile phones during instructional time and lunch breaks.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"/&gt; The default rule would be that phones would be required to remain hidden, but principals could also choose to "require students to store phones in backpacks or in a designated place; allow use of phones during lunch or in designated areas; or allow phones to be used for instructional purposes".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; De Blasio said that the policy shift would allow to parents stay in better touch with their children, particularly in emergencies, especially in case of an emergency, and Schools Chancellor [[Carmen Fariña]] noted that the change means that students in schools with metal detector would no longer have to pay outside vendors to store phones for them during the school day.&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"/&gt;

Students tend to support the side that grants them the opportunity to bring mobile phones in school campus, arguing that phones allow them to reach their parents if any problem occurs. Parents also argue that there isn't a replacement for mobile phones, so phones are an essential device to carry around. If their child is in danger or doesn't feel safe, he or she has to be able to reach out to them.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Future-for-cell-phones-in-classrooms/52871235142490/|title=Future for cell phones in classrooms?|last=Soloway|first=Elliot|date=|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that having a phone shows responsibility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

[[Theft]] of mobile phones is a concern in some schools. For example, in the [[Wichita School District]] (USD 259) public schools, 80 cases of theft of cell phones were reported in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Preventing-cell-phones-from-being-stolen-at-school-326128761.html Preventing cell phones from being stolen at school], [[KAKE]] (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, following an undercover investigation, thirteen students in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], all juveniles, were arrested and charged with running a cell phone theft ring that resulted in the theft of several thousand dollars' worth of mobile phones, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], and other [[Consumer electronics|electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Stamm, [http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Cell-Phone-Thefts-Bensalem-High-137123123.html High School Cell Phone Theft Ring Busted], NBC Philadelphia (January 11, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing number of schools are now allowing use of cell phones as learning tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/08/07/views-shift-on-cell-phones-in-schools/2607381/ |title=More schools use cellphones as learning tools |author=Josh Higgins |publisher=USA Today |date=7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of cell phones in schools is challenging. Some schools reported allowing all students to use cell phones at the same time slows down school [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y. School Blocks Cell Phones from Wi-Fi Network|url=http://www.campussafetymagazine.com/article/n.y._school_blocks_cell_phones_from_wi_fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Governors Highway Safety Association]], while no state bans all mobile-phone use for all drivers, 20 states and the [[District of Columbia]] prohibit [[school bus]] [[Bus driver|drivers]] from using mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html Distracted Driving Laws], Governors Highway Safety Association (last updated February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; School bus drivers have been fired or suspended for using the phone or [[Texting while driving|text-messaging while driving]].&lt;ref&gt;Steph Solis, [http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/10/28/academy-charter-high-student-films-driver-texting-while-driving-speeding/74734370/ School bus driver fired for speeding, texting], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'' (October 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/Local/basd-school-bus-driver-suspended-for-allegedly-texting-and-driving/36117460 Bethlehem Area School District bus driver suspended for allegedly texting and driving], WFMZ (October 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/school-bus-driver-suspended-after-cellphone-video-shows-her-texting/ School Bus Driver Suspended After Cellphone Video Shows Her Texting], [[ABC News]] (September 20, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apps Used by Students for Schoolwork ===
Mobile phones can be very beneficial in schools. There are many apps used that help students excel.

==== Quizlet ====
Quizlet is an online study tool that allows you to make digital notecards and allows you to see other peoples notecard sets.  The Quizlet app is very easy and accessible to use.  Quizlet has multiple ways to test yourself using different variations of games. Quizlet has over 30 million active users.

==== Tophat ====
Tophat is used in many different classes to record attendance and take quizzes.  It allows the professors to know whether you were in class or not and whether you were participating or not.

==== TurningPoint ====
TurningPoint is similar to the previous mentioned app, Tophat. It is used as an interactive polling inside the classroom. Professors can also track attendance and provide quizzes for the students with the use of this app.

==== Rider ====
Rider is an app currently used at multiple colleges to locate the buses throughout the bus system.  It allows students to track the buses and give them an estimated time of arrival.

These apps have helped students around the world on a day to day basis.  These apps encourage the use of cell phones and/or computers during school classes. Students and professors are moving more and more to only using electronics. 

== Messaging Applications ==
With the rise of use of mobile cell phones in school, applications for these cellphones have been created to support this. As of February 2018, 80,000 applications were available for teacher use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetechedvocate.org/13-best-apps-high-school-students/|title=13 of the Best Apps for High School Students - The Tech Edvocate|website=www.thetechedvocate.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A variety of messaging apps provide communication for student to student relationships as well as teacher to student. Some popular apps for both student, teacher, and parent use are ClassDojo, and Remind. This accounts for the 72% of iTunes’ top selling education apps are for preschoolers and elementary school students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/parentingcom/technology-in-the-classroom_b_2456450.html|title=Technology in the Classroom; The Pros and Cons|last=|first=|date=|website=Parenting.Com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apps like Remind and ClassDojo offer many different abilities such as language translation, scheduled reminders, and parent messages.

ClassDojo is one of the Apps that is used widely throughout schools. According to crunchbase.com, it is a “means to encourage learning, skill development and character building among students”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classdojo#section-overview|title=ClassDojo|last=|first=|date=|website=CrunchBase|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The app offers a platform for teachers to share pictures, videos, and reports with parents and administrators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Remind App is another way for teachers to communicate with parents and administration. The App allows teachers to send out scheduled text messages to parents, and also provides a class blog for the teacher to update with upcoming due dates, tests/quizzes, and other class information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsense.org/education/website/remind|title=Remind - Review For Teachers|date=2013-12-08|work=Common Sense Education|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WhatsApp is different from the other apps because it provides communication for students to other students. The app offers group chats, video messaging, video class, and photo messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=WhatsApp|date=2018-10-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WhatsApp&amp;oldid=864815918|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another app that allows students to communicate is GroupMe. GroupMe allows students to communicate in a group chat, while also only using WiFi instead of cellular data. Some college-aged students use this app for sharing course information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/groupme|title=GroupMe - App Review|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology in schools is becoming a common practice throughout many grades and age levels. The creation of messaging applications helps support this boom of usage in schools. This new technology comes with both pros and cons. A pro of messaging apps is their easy usage and accessibility to student, teachers, and parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
Accessibility of the messaging apps makes it easier for parents with disabilities, demanding full time jobs, and language barriers to communicate more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |website=Otus |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A con is that not all students and parents have this technology available to them. This can cause a gap in students who have cellphones and computers and those who do not. Increased access and transparency can make students shift their responsibilities to their parents, minimizing student ownership. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |website=Otus |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another con is the ease in sharing of information can lead to academic dishonesty. This is a policy colleges are cracking down on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php|title=LSU Code of Student Conduct {{!}} Student Advocacy &amp; Accountability|last=(LSU)|first=Louisiana State University|website=www.lsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the kinks of messaging applications become smoothed out over time, the future of them lies ahead. By minimizing both student and parent entitlement, setting communication boundaries, stating expectations early, and reinforcing student responsibility some of the cons from messaging apps can be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is hope that they become more advanced, specifically when using them for help via a bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/03/5-things-need-know-future-messaging-platforms/|title=5 things you need to know about the future of messaging platforms - Watson|date=2017-03-06|work=Watson|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advancement in this field will allow for higher frequency of use, more emotional connection, and higher convenience for users. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2016/09/22/the-future-of-messaging-apps/#27e9dbcb7b87|title=The Future Of Messaging Apps|last=Forrester|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open standard''' is a [[Technical standard|standard]] that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how it was designed (e.g. open process).  There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage.

The terms ''open'' and ''standard'' have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage.  There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification, the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard. The term "standard" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis.

The definitions of the term ''open standard'' used by academics, the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark, France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation side, the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a [[royalty-free]] basis.

Many definitions of the term ''standard'' permit patent holders to impose "reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard.  For example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF),  [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), and [[ITU-T]] permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as "open standards", while the others refer only to producing "standards". The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of "open standard" that allow [[Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing|"reasonable and non-discriminatory" patent licensing]] fee requirements.

There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an "open standard" is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented and extended.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Henry William | last1= Chesbrough |first2= Wim | last2= Vanhaverbeke|first3= Joel | last3=  West |title=Tim Simcoe: 'Chapter 8: Open Standards and Intellectual Property Rights' in Open Innovation: Researching A New Paradigm | publisher= Oxford University Press | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232957368_Open_Innovation_Researching_A_New_Paradigm |year =2008|accessdate= April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body, it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded.&lt;ref name="Langlois, Richard N 1999"&gt;Langlois, Richard N. "Technological Standards, Innovation, and Essential Facilities: Toward a Schmpeterian Post-Chicago Approach." (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The typical example of “open source” that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted as “open” which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Greenstein, Shane, and Victor Sango, eds. ''Standards and Public Policy''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as [[open format]]s.

Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms (if they can be obtained at all) from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification.  As such these specifications are not considered to be fully ''open''. Joel West has argued that "open" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of "openness". Ultimately a standard needs{{According to whom|date=April 2015}} to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market, but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard. A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can occur when a firm’s platform “wins” in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular.&lt;ref&gt;Joel West as cited Greenstein, Shane, and Victor Sango, eds. Standards and Public Policy. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2012, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),  Internet Society (ISOC), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB), [https://open-stand.org/about-us/affirmation/ jointly affirmed] a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies.  The [https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/ “OpenStand Principles”] define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation.  Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open, participatory process, support interoperability, foster global competition, are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers.  This drives innovation which, in turn, contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets.

'''There are five, key OpenStand Principles, as outlined below:'''

'''1. Cooperation'''
Respectful cooperation between standards organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity, processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.

'''2. Adherence to Principles''' - Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development, namely

*'''''Due process:''''' Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants. No one party dominates or guides standards development. Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions. Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined.
*'''''Broad consensus:''''' Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range of interests.
*'''''Transparency:''''' Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation. Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided. Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption.
*'''''Balance:''''' Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group.
*'''''Openness:''''' Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties.

'''3. Collective Empowerment'''
Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that:

* are chosen and defined based on technical merit, as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant;
* provide global interoperability, scalability, stability, and resiliency;
* enable global competition;
* serve as building blocks for further innovation; and
* contribute to the creation of global communities, benefiting humanity.

'''4. Availability'''
Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment. Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms. Given market diversity, fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).

'''5. Voluntary Adoption'''
Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.

=== ITU-T definition ===
The [[ITU-T]] is a [[standards organization|standards development organization]] (SDO) that is one of the three sectors of the [[ITU|International Telecommunications Union]] (a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]]).  The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's ''Ad Hoc'' group on IPR that produced the following definition in March 2005, which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/othergroups/ipr-adhoc/openstandards.html|title=ITU-T|author=|date=|website=www.itu.int|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The [[ITU-T]] has a long history of open standards development. However, recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term "Open Standard" in a variety of different ways. In order to avoid confusion, the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term "Open Standards" per the following definition:
: "Open Standards" are standards made available to the general public and are developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. "Open Standards" facilitate [[interoperability]] and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.
: Other elements of "Open Standards" include, but are not limited to:
:*Collaborative process – voluntary and market driven development (or approval) following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties.
:* Reasonably balanced – ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group.
:* Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties.
:* Intellectual property rights (IPRs) – IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation). Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the [[standards organization|SDO]].
:* Quality and level of detail – sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services. Standardized interfaces are not hidden, or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard.
:* Publicly available – easily available for implementation and use, at a reasonable price. Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO.
:* On-going support – maintained and supported over a long period of time.

The [[ITU-T]], [[ITU-R]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] have harmonized on a common patent policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/|title=ITU-T|author=|date=|website=www.itu.int|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the banner of the [[World Standards Cooperation|WSC]]. However, the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R, ISO and IEC contexts, since the Common Patent Policy 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3770791/customview.html?func=ll&amp;objId=3770791&amp;objAction=browse&amp;sort=name|title=00. ISO standards and patents|author=|date=|website=isotc.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
does not make any reference to "open standards" but rather only to "standards."

=== IETF definition ===
In section 7 of its RFC 2026, the [[IETF]] classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being "open standards," and lists the standards produced by [[ANSI]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[IEEE]], and [[ITU-T]] as examples.  As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T, the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of "open standards."

However, the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of "open standard"; both RFC 2026 and the IETF's mission statement (RFC 3935) talks about "open process," but RFC 2026 does not define "open standard" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to.

RFC 2026 belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP 9 (Best Common Practice, an IETF policy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp9 BCP 9]: The Internet Standards Process&lt;/ref&gt;
RFC 2026 was later updated by BCP 78 and 79 (among others).  As of 2011 BCP 78 is RFC 5378 (Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust),&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp78 BCP 78]: Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust&lt;/ref&gt; and BCP 79 consists of RFC 3979 (Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology) and a clarification in RFC 4879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp79 BCP 79]: Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology&lt;/ref&gt; The changes are intended to be compatible with the "Simplified [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] License" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC 5377.&lt;ref&gt;[[IETF]] [http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info Trust Legal Provisions] (page offers a FAQ for non-lawyers)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the IETF combined with the W3C and [[IEEE]] to launch OpenStand &lt;ref name="OpenStand"&gt;[http://open-stand.org OpenStand]: OpenStand: Principles for The Modern Standard Paradigm&lt;/ref&gt; and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures "the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce". The declaration is then published in the form of RFC 6852  in January 2013.

=== European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services ===
The [[European Union]] defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services, Version 1.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Docd552.pdf?id=19529 European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services], Version 1.0 (2004) {{ISBN|92-894-8389-X}} page 9&lt;/ref&gt; although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all [[European Union]] use and documentation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on open standards.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "open" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties (consensus or majority decision etc.).
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee.
* The intellectual property - i.e. patents possibly present - of (parts of) the standard is made irrevocably available on a [[royalty-free]] basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Docd552.pdf?id=19529 |format=PDF |title=European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services |author=European Communities |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition ===
The [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] (NCOIC) defines open standard as the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products. It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncoic.org/home Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium], {{citation |url=http://wiki.ncoic.net/index.php?title=Open_Standards |title=NCOIC Lexicon}}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Danish government definition ===
The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itst.dk/it-arkitektur-og-standarder/standardisering/Tekniske-standarder/arkiv/oio-kataloget-arkiv-version/Definition_of_open_standards.pdf|title="Definitions of Open Standards", 2004|author=|date=|website=itst.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
which also is used in pan-European software development projects. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge (i.e. there is no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard)
* An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge (i.e. owners renounce their options, if indeed such exist, to limit access to the standard at a later date, for example, by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life)
*An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details (i.e. all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation is free)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== French law definition ===
The French Parliament approved a definition of "open standard" in its "Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000801164&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id|title="Loi nº 2004-575" for the Confidence in the Digital Economy," June 21, 2004|author=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EstandaresAbiertos.org|title=Estándares abiertos e interoperabilidad. Foro sobre Estándares Abiertos.|author=|date=|website=www.estandaresabiertos.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* By open standard is understood any communication, interconnection or interchange protocol, and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Indian Government Definition ===

A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government &lt;ref name="Policy in India"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India|title=Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance|url=https://egovstandards.gov.in/sites/default/files/Published_Policy_Framework_Document/Policy%20on%20Open%20Standards%20for%20e-Governance.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2014|ref=india}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''4.1 Mandatory Characteristics'''
An Identified Standard will qualify as an “Open Standard”, if it meets the following criteria:
*4.1.1 Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee.
* 4.1.2 The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the lifetime of the Standard.
* 4.1.3 Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization, wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent, collaborative and consensual manner.
* 4.1.4 Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible.
* 4.1.5 Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification.
* 4.1.6 Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support, where applicable, for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Italian Law definition ===

Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards, although concentrating on data formats, in Art. 68 of the Code of the Digital Administration (''Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art. 68 CAD|url=http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2005-03-07;82!vig=|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

[applications must] allow representation of data under different formats, at least one being an open data format.

[...]

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[it is defined] an open data format, a data format which is made public, is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spanish law definition ===
A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2007/06/23/pdfs/A27150-27166.pdf|title="Ley 11/2007" of Public Electronic Access of the Citizens to the Public Services, June, 22nd 2007|author=|date=|website=boe.es|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards. It defines an open standard as royalty free, according to the following definition:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An open standard fulfills the following conditions:
* it is public, and its use is available on a free [gratis] basis, or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user.
* its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual [copyright] or industrial [patents and trademarks] property right.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Venezuelan law definition ===
The Venezuelan Government approved a "free software and open standards law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/docMgr/sharedfiles/Decreto3390.pdf "Decreto 3390" of Free Software and Open Standards, December, 23rd 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards, and includes a definition of open standard:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Article 2: for the purposes of this Decree, it shall be understood as 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
k) Open standards: technical specifications, published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development, that have been accepted by the industry, available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other [type of software], promoting competitivity, interoperability and flexibility.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== South African Government definition ===
The South African Government approved a definition in the "Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook" (MIOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpsa.gov.za/documents/egov/MIOSVer4_1_2007.pdf|title="Government of South Africa, MIOS Version 4.1 2007"|author=|date=|website=dpsa.gov.za|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the MIOS, a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria. There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects. In such cases, where an open standard does not yet exist, the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard:

#it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization
#participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties.
#open access: all may access committee documents, drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee.
#It must be possible for everyone to copy, distribute and use the standard free of cost.
#The intellectual rights required to implement the standard (e.g.essential patent claims) are irrevocably available, without any royalties attached.
#There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard.
#There are multiple implementations of the standard.

=== New Zealand official interoperability framework definition ===
The E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e.govt.nz/standards/e-gif/e-gif-v-3-1/policy/e-gif-v-3-1-policy.pdf|title="New Zealand E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF)" version 3.0, June, 22nd 2007|author=|date=|website=e.govt.nz|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While a universally agreed definition of "open standards" is unlikely to be
resolved in the near future, the e-GIF accepts that a definition of “open standards”
needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open, and encompasses
varying degrees of "openness." To guide readers in this respect, the e-GIF
endorses "open standards" that exhibit the following properties:

* Be accessible to everyone free of charge: no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard.
* Remain accessible to everyone free of charge: owners should renounce their options, if any, to limit access to the standard at a later date.
* Be documented in all its details: all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation should be free.

The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on
the highways. Driving would be excessively costly, inefficient, and ineffective if
road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Bruce Perens' definition ===
One of the most popular definitions of the term "open standard," as measured by Google ranking, is the one developed by [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/opendocument-open.html|title=Is OpenDocument an Open Standard? Yes!|author=|date=|website=www.dwheeler.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His [http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html definition] lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard:

#Availability: Open Standards are available for all to read and implement.
#Maximize End-User Choice: Open Standards create a fair, competitive market for implementations of the standard. They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group.
#No Royalty: Open Standards are free for all to ''implement'', with no royalty or fee. ''Certification'' of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee.
#No Discrimination: Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor’s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.
#Extension or Subset: Implementations of Open Standards may be extended, or offered in subset form. However, certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations, and may place requirements upon extensions (see ''Predatory Practices'').
#Predatory Practices: Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by ''[[Embrace, extend and extinguish|embrace-and-extend]]'' tactics. The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions, and a license for all others to create, distribute, and sell software that is compatible with the extensions. An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions.

=== Microsoft's definition ===
Vijay Kapoor, national technology officer, [[Microsoft]], defines what open standards are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/fcreative.asp?edid=27036|title=OOXML: To Be, or Not To Be&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=efytimes.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let's look at what an open standard means: 'open' refers to it being royalty-free, while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis. An open standard is publicly available, and developed, approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall, Microsoft's relationship to open standards was, at best, mixed.  While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards, it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption.&lt;ref name="CassonRyan2006"&gt;{{Citation |ssrn=1656616 |author1=Casson, Tony |author2=Ryan, Patrick S. |contribution=Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the public sector, and their relationship to Microsoft’s market dominance |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Standards edge: unifier or divider? |editor=Sherrie Bolin |page=87 |publisher=Sheridan Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open Source Initiative's definition ===
The [[Open Source Initiative]] defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/osr|title=Open Standards Requirement for Software - Open Source Initiative|author=|date=|website=opensource.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Requirement'''

An "open standard" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.

'''The Criteria'''

To comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an "open standard" must satisfy the following criteria. If an "open standard" does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.

# No Intentional Secrets: The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation. As flaws are inevitable, the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR.
# Availability: The standard MUST be freely and publicly available (e.g., from a stable web site) under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost.
# Patents: All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST:
#* be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use, or
#* be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software
# No Agreements: There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement, NDA, grant, click-through, or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard.
# No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies: Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement.

=== Ken Krechmer's definition ===
[[Ken Krechmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrstds.com/openstds.html|title=The Meaning of Open Standards|author=|date=|website=www.csrstds.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies ten "rights":

#Open Meeting
#Consensus
#Due Process
#Open IPR
#One World
#Open Change
#Open Documents
#Open Interface
#Open Use
#On-going Support

=== World Wide Web Consortium's definition ===
As an important provider of Web technology [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] Standards, notably [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|http]], [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/2005/09/dd-osd.html Definition of Open Standards] World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the end result, the spec alone, up for adoption, is not enough. The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design, and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*transparency (due process is public, and all technical discussions, meeting minutes, are archived and referencable in decision making)
*relevance (new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs, including requirements phase, e.g. accessibility, multi-linguism)
*openness (anybody can participate, and everybody does: industry, individual, public, government bodies, academia, on a worldwide scale)
*impartiality and consensus (guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization, with equal weight for each participant)
*availability (free access to the standard text, both during development, at final stage, and for translations, and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free)
*maintenance (ongoing process for testing, errata, revision, permanent access, validation, etc.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2012, the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand &lt;ref name="OpenStand"/&gt; and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures "the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce".

=== Digital Standards Organization definition ===

The [[Digital Standards Organization]] (DIGISTAN) states that "an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users."&lt;ref name="Defining Open Standard"&gt;[http://www.digistan.org/text:rationale Defining "Open Standard"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its brief definition of "open standard" (or "free and open standard") is "a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle."  Its more complete definition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* "The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties.
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute, and use it freely.
* The patents possibly present on (parts of) the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard.

A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle. Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon, trust, and extend an open standard over time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digistan.org/open-standard:definition What is an Open Standard?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of "open standard," but with changes to address what it terms as "vendor capture."  They believe that "Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process. We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs, and the market at large, which seeks freedom and lower costs... Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards. They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard.' A robust definition of "free and open standard" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large."&lt;ref name="Defining Open Standard"/&gt;

=== Free Software Foundation Europe's definition ===

The [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) uses a [http://fsfe.org/projects/os/def.html definition] which is based on the [[European Interoperability Framework]] v.1, and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders. FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the [http://www.selfproject.eu/ SELF] EU Project, the 2008 Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet, and international [[Document Freedom Day]] teams.

According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is:

# Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties;
# Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves;
# Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model;
# Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties;
# Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors, or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties.

=== FFII's definition ===

The [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]]'s definition is said{{by whom|date=September 2015}} to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in 2004.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A specification that is public, the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process, everybody can implement it without any restriction, neither payment, to license the IPR (granted to everybody for free and without any condition). This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C. Of course, all the other bodies accept open standards. But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money (ie. 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===UK government definition===

The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability, data and document formats. The criteria for open standards are published in the “[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles Open Standards Principles]” policy paper and are as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties.
#Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent, and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process.
#Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality.
#Fair access - the standard is published, thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost. Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process. Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field.
#Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions, the standard is mature, supported by the market and demonstrates platform, application and vendor independence.
#Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Patents==
In 2002 and 2003 the controversy about using [[reasonable and non-discriminatory]] (RAND) [[licensing]] for the use of patented technology in [[web standard]]s increased. [[Bruce Perens]], important associations as [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] or [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]] and others have argued that the use of [[patent]]s restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology. The [[requirement]] to pay some small amount per user, is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone. [[Royalty-free|Royalty free]] (RF) licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations. Version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]] includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works.

One result of this controversy was that many governments (including the Danish, French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively) specifically affirmed that "open standards" required royalty-free licenses.  Some standards organizations, such as the [[W3C]], modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing.

Patents for [[software patent|software, formulas and algorithms]] are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU.  The [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html#A52_2_c European Patent Convention Article 52 paragraph (2)(c)] expressly prohibits algorithms, business methods and software from being covered by patents.  The US has only allowed them since 1989 and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility.

A standards body and its associated processes cannot ''force'' a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees, especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process. In fact, this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an "open" approach, fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members. Few bodies will carry out (or require their members to carry out) a full patent search. Ultimately, the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard, try to rework around it, or work to invalidate the patent.  Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group, and this is generally considered enforceable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include [[JPEG#Patent issues|JPEG]] and the [[Rambus]] case over [[DDR SDRAM]]. The [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC#Patent licensing|H.264 video codec]] is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known, non-royalty-free required patents.

Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection. Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being "invented around" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from.&lt;ref name="Langlois, Richard N 1999"/&gt;

==Legitimacy of standards==
{{POV-section|date=December 2007}}{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2007}}

'''Legitimate standards''' are, to some critics, only those [[standardization|standard]]s whose documentation can be downloaded free-of-charge, and which can be implemented without [[royalties]] or other restrictions.

[[Request for Comments|Internet Request for Comments]] (RFCs) are an example of such [[open standards]]. However, many standards organisations attempt to support themselves by restricting standard documentation through [[copyright]]s (and selling copies), and restricting implementation through [[patent]]s (and selling licenses). 
While this second approach does solve the issue of how to pay for the time (and sometimes travel for meetings, and in some cases on-location research) of those writing the standards, it can cause significant problems.

Standards which cost money to purchase and/or license cause significant problems for:
* developers of [[free software]] and [[open hardware]];
* electronics hobbyists;
* manufacturers of small-volume products; and 
* those developing new products who [[Startup company|lack sufficient access to capital]].

An engineer may spend more time just trying to figure out what is involved in implementing and licensing such a standard than
it would take to actually implement an open standard. Expensive standards often show evidence of having been [[Design by committee|designed by a committee]]. Sometimes, they appear to have gratuitous deviations from existing practice that appear to serve the
interests of the standards organization in creating protectable [[intellectual property]], rather than the societal interests. When standards documents are not affordable, it can cause trouble for technicians trying to debug systems, as well as intelligent end users trying to evaluate or understand the technology.

Standards committee members sometimes double-dip by selling books or classes on how to implement a standard; the more arbitrary the standard, the more market for these add-on products. Some formal standards are developed by people who are more office politicians than engineers. Sometimes, licensing of standards is also used to [[Digital rights management|circumvent a user's legal rights to fair use copying]] by preventing the development of equipment or software that allows such copying.

Sometimes, standards organizations may involve companies with vested interests that all "contribute" patents (subject to licensing), when freely available [[technology]] would have done better. Some standards organizations appear to collect millions of dollars a year for a single standard, or a small set of closely related standards, yet appear to do very little in terms of active standards development.

There are some alternative ways of funding standards:
* funding by governments (for example, [[NIST]]);
* making money from optional compatibility [[certification mark]] licensing, rather than patent licensing;
* developing standards, and making them open to all to create a market;  
* developing own standards by end-users.
* instituting cost cutting measures, including using [[teleconference]], rather than expensive travel;
* developing standards by one person, or a few people, and simply offering up for use (such as internet RFCs); where if anyone likes it, they can use it, otherwise, they can come up with a better standard or suggest revisions.

It is worth noting the outcome of the competition between the truly open standards of the [[TCP/IP]] [[protocol stack]] (the basis of the Internet), the designed-by-committee and pay for copies [[OSI model|OSI protocol stack]], and the various vendor [[proprietary]] [[Wide area network|WAN]] standards ([[Decnet]],[[SNA]]). TCP/IP dominates.

Less open standards are more competitive when:
* there are no open alternatives; 
* they get to the market first; 
* extensive marketing is used to prop them up; 
* they have a significant technical advantage.

=== Legitimacy/Openness factors ===
* Is the standard documented?
* Is the standard available for all to use, or is it intended to create a [[monopoly]] or [[vendor lock-in]]?
* Is the documentation available for immediate download, free of charge?
* Can the standard be implemented without payment of [[royalties]], membership, or license fees?
* Does licensing the standard pose other restrictions (such as copy protection enforcement)?
* Is sufficient information available to implement the standard without purchasing official documents?
* Are there any patents interfering with the implementation of the standard?
* Are [[trademark]]s enforced in such a way as to interfere with the use of the standard?
* Does the standard avoid arbitrary deviations from existing standard practice?
* Does the standard use appropriate technology?
* Is the standard supported by multiple companies?
* Are licensing fees stated up front?
* Is uniform licensing available (all companies pay comparable fee per unit)?
* Are licensing fees reasonable for small volumes (1-1000 units)?  Is overhead minimal?
* Are licenses free if the product is free?
* How does the openness of the standard compare to competing standards?
* Is the standard extensible?
* Is the standard locked to a particular platform?

=== Some examples ===
Here are some comparisons between different formats..

* WAN: [[TCP/IP]] is much more open than the [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] protocol suite, DECnet, SNA, etc.
* LAN: TCP/IP is much more open than [[NBF]], the [[NetWare]] protocol stack, etc. 
* Video/Audio: "Ogg [[Vorbis]] Audio" and "Ogg [[Theora]] Video" are much more open than other formats, including those with official standards such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[MPEG]]1/2/4, etc. Ogg standards are free. Vorbis is patent-free and Theora's patents are automatically licensed, free of charge. Vorbis also appears to offer better audio quality than MP3 or AAC. For [[streaming audio]], [[Icecast]] and [[Peercast]] are more open than RealPlayer or Windows Media Player. MPEG2 patents reportedly cost $2.50 per device (no minimums or annual fees), but there are additional royalties for streaming services, media, etc.
* Instant Messaging:  [[Jabber]] is much more open than [[AIM]], [[ICQ]], [[MSN]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], etc. However, companies such as [[AOL]] have tried to sabotage Jabber by blocking the gateways between Jabber and AIM/ICQ.
* Office Applications: [[OpenDocument]] and [[Office Open XML]] files are much more open than the old [[Microsoft Office]] binary file formats which are proprietary Microsoft controlled formats that are freely available and free to implement. 
* Flash memory: [[Multi Media Card|MMC]] is more open than [[Secure Digital Card]] (though the two are largely interchangeable, if used carefully. SD-card is more open than [[xD-Picture Card]] or [[Sony Memory Stick]]. [[CompactFlash]], based closely on [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]], is more open than SD-card.
* [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] appears to be more open than [[FireWire]]. USB standards can be downloaded for free, and there do not appear to be any licensing fees if one does not use the USB-certified logos.  FireWire ports are covered by dozens of patents; these patents can be licensed for $0.25 per device with no minimum or annual fees.

=== Examples outside of computer technology ===
* One of the earliest and most successful examples of an independent standards organization promoting open standards that could be freely used by hobbyists and commercial manufacturers alike has been the [[National Model Railroad Association]]. Prior to the NMRA's inception, most manufacturers had their own proprietary standards for track, wheels, and so forth, and it was quite rare for commercial models made by different manufacturers to operate well together. In 1935, the hobbyists took charge, forming the NMRA, developing open standards to promote free interchange of models, and making it known that even among non-member hobbyists, compliance with those standards would be worth more to a manufacturer than any intentional incompatibility could possibly be.

Formally beginning in 2015, Phandeeyar provides funding and training for emerging [[startups]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Internet innovators emerge amid connectivity boom|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Myanmar-s-Internet-innovators-emerge-amid-connectivity-boom|website=Nikkei Asian Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phandeeyar also conducts trainings, hosts workshops, and holds competitions for startups within the digital sector.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Lanmadaw, Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) - panoramio (3).jpg|upright|thumb|175px|Yangon, Myanmar]]

In 2014, Phandeeyar emerged from a [[hackathon]] named "Code for Change Myanmar"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of risk capital in Myanmar: David Madden, Phandeeyar|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/we-believe-very-deeply-in-the-potential-of-the-tech-community-phandeeyars-david-madden-41822/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where its founder and current CEO, [[David Madden (entrepreneur)|David Madden]], wanted to promote the growth of Myanmar's digital sector. Through this hackathon, politics and elections were addressed. 

Madden states the need for better financial support for emerging start-ups in Myanmar which also led to the creation of the accelerator.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first1=Site designed and built by Hydrant|title=David Madden, Founder &amp; CEO, Phandeeyar: Myanmar Innovation Lab: Interview|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/interview/david-madden-founder-ceo-phandeeyar-myanmar-innovation-lab/myanmar-2017|website=Oxford Business Group|language=en|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===

Phandeeyar's sponsors and investors include the [[Omidyar Network]] which has donated 2 million US dollars to the company, &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phandeeyar gets $2 million grant for tech start-ups|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/20631-phandeeyar-gets-2-million-grant-for-tech-start-ups.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], and the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="invest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omidyar Network grant jumpstarts for-profit accelerator in Myanmar|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/omidyar-network-grant-jumpstarts-profit-accelerator-myanmar|website=Digital News Asia|language=en|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

David Madden states that Phandeeyar's objective is to connect those in the tech field with others actively working in the social sector through different events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madden and Soloff on the Power of the Smartphone|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/madden-and-soloff-on-the-power-of-the-smartphone-1438715401|website=Wall Street Journal|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Events and Initiatives===

In 2015, Phandeeyar hosted a two week event event called "MaePaySoe" (translating to "let's vote")&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hackers in programming meet to prepare for the vote|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/technology/16485-hackers-in-programming-meet-to-prepare-for-the-vote.html|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than one hundred web developers gathered to create technology which informs the general public about potential political candidates in Myanmar and the country's voting process.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;
===Seed Funding===
In 2016, around fifteen to twenty startups were projected to be accepted into the accelerator in a three year span.&lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; Phandeeyar also plans to invest around $2 million into startups in the near future. &lt;ref name=":100"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar: Phandeeyar sets up accelerator, to invest $200k in 8 startups in 2016 - DealStreetAsia|url=https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/phandeeyar-to-seed-fund-up-to-200000-through-their-first-tech-startup-accelerator-43871/|website=www.dealstreetasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the startups accepted, Phandeeyar would claim a 12 percent ownership of the companies. 
Those selected for Phandeeyar's 6 month training program would receive a funding of $25,000 to launch their ventures in addition to business partnerships to help with the early stages of their startups. &lt;ref name="invest"/&gt; These partnerships include leaders from regional companies such as the Myanmar Information Technology, CarsDB, [[Muru-D]]. and Golden Gate Ventures. &lt;ref name=":100"/&gt; Towards the end of the program, companies have the opportunity to pitch their startup ideas to [[venture capitalists]] and [[angel investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Roundup (February 25)|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/business/business-roundup-february-25.html|website=The Irrawaddy|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Select startups from Phandeeyar====

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

The '''Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies''' was established in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about/mission/ nanotechproject.org] &amp;ndash; Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was intended to address the social, political, and public safety aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It intended in particular to look for research and policy gaps and opportunities in knowledge and regulatory processes, and to develop strategies for closing them. The project worked with multiple U.S. and foreign governments and organizations.

The project's stated goal was "to inform the debate and to create an active public and policy dialogue. It was not an advocate either for, or against, particular nanotechnologies. Rather, the Project sought to ensure that as these technologies are developed, potential human health and environmental risks were anticipated, properly understood, and effectively managed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about About The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The '''SDEP''' ('''Street events Data Exchange Protocol''') comprises an [[XML schema|XML data schema]] and web service [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] for exchanging information about streetworks, roadworks, and street events between systems.

Elgin was funded by the UK NeSDS Government e-Standards Programme to conduct a consultation and convene meetings to define the requirements of a common data exchange protocol for streetworks registers and other systems handling street events data. SDEP was developed to allow the open exchange of such data between back office systems used by [[local authorities]] to manage their highway networks in order to enable [[EGovernment|e-Government]] and streetworks co-ordination.

The SDEP consultation group comprised ELGIN (Chair), Mayrise Ltd., Symology Ltd., [[Pitney Bowes|Pitney Bowes Inc.]], [[Bentley Systems|Exor Corporation (Bentley Systems)]], &lt;!-- [[Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire County Council]] (representing the --&gt;[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]&lt;!--)--&gt; and [[Transport for London]], with the [[Highways Agency|National Traffic Control Centre]] in an observing capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53997">The [[Session Initiation Protocol]] ('''SIP''') is the signaling protocol selected by the [[3GPP|3rd Generation Partnership Project]] (3GPP)&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Camarillo /&gt; to create and control multimedia sessions with two or more participants in the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS), and therefore is a key element in the IMS framework.

SIP was developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)]] as a standard for controlling multimedia communication sessions in [[Internet Protocol|Internet Protocol (IP)]] networks, working in the [[application layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. Several '''SIP extensions''' have been added to the basic protocol specification in order to extend its functionality.&lt;ref name=TheIMS /&gt;&lt;ref name=RedHat /&gt;&lt;ref name=SNT /&gt; These extensions are based on [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) protocol recommendations by the IETF.

The 3GPP, which is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations aimed at developing and maintaining the IMS, stated a series of requirements for SIP&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt; to be successfully used in the IMS. Some of them could be addressed by using existing capabilities and extensions in SIP while, in other cases, the 3GPP had to collaborate with the IETF to standardize new SIP extensions&lt;ref name=RFC7315 /&gt;  to meet the new requirements. In any case, the IETF evolves SIP in a generic basis, so that the use of its extensions is not restricted to the IMS framework.

== 3GPP requirements for SIP ==
The 3GPP has stated several general requirements stated for operation of the IMS. These include an efficient use of the [[Cellular network|radio interface]] by minimizing the exchange of signaling messages between the mobile terminal and the network, a minimum session setup time by performing tasks prior to session establishment instead of during session establishment, a minimum support required in the terminal, the support for [[roaming]] and non-roaming scenarios with terminal mobility management (supported by the access network, not SIP), and support for [[IPv6]] addressing.

Other requirements involve protocol extensions, such as SIP [[Header (computing)|header fields]] to exchange user or server information, and SIP [[List of SIP request methods|methods]] to support new network functionality: requirement for registration, re-registration, de-registration, event notifications, [[instant messaging]] or call control primitives with additional capabilities such as call transference.

Other specific requirements are:&lt;ref name=RFC4083 /&gt;
*[[Quality of service]] support with policy and charging control, as well as resource negotiation and allocation before alerting the destination user.
*Identification of users for [[Diameter protocol|authentication, authorization and accounting]] purposes. [[Computer security|Security]] between users and the network and among network nodes is a major issue to be addressed by using mutual [[authentication]] mechanisms such as [[Public-key cryptography|private and public keys]] and [[Cryptographic hash function|digests]], as well as media [[authorization]] extensions. It must be also possible to present both the caller and the called party the identities of their counterparts, with the ability to hide this information if required. [[Anonymity]] in session establishment and [[information privacy|privacy]] are also important.
*Protection of SIP signaling with integrity and confidentiality support based on initial authentication and [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric cryptographic keys]]; error recovery and verification are also needed.
*Session release initiated by the network (e.g. in case the user terminal leaves coverage or runs out of credit).
*[[Source routing|Source-routing mechanisms]]. The [[routing]] of SIP messages has its own requirements in the IMS as all terminal originated session setup attempts must transit both the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|P-CSCF and the S-CSCF]] so that these call session control functions (CSCFs) servers can properly provide their services. There can be special path requirements for certain messages as well.
*Interoperation between IMS and the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

Finally, it is also necessary that other protocols and network services such as [[DHCP]] or [[DNS]]&lt;ref name=RFC3263 /&gt; are adapted to work with SIP, for instance for outbound proxy (P-CSCF) location and SIP [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] to [[IP address]] resolution, respectively.

== Extension negotiation mechanism ==
There is a mechanism&lt;ref name=Camarillo /&gt; in SIP for extension negotiation between user agents (UA) or servers, consisting of three [[Header (computing)|header]] fields: ''supported'', ''require'' and ''unsupported'', which UAs or servers (i.e. user terminals or [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|call session control function (CSCF)]] in IMS) may use to specify the extensions they understand. When a client initiates a SIP dialog with a server, it states the extensions it ''requires'' to be used and also other extensions that are understood (''supported''), and the server will then send a response with a list of extensions that it ''requires''. If these extensions are not listed in the client's message, the response from the server will be an error response. Likewise, if the server does not support any of the client's required extensions, it will send an error response with a list of its ''unsupported'' extensions. This kind of extensions are called ''option tags'', but SIP can also be extended with new [[List of SIP request methods|''methods'']]. In that case, user agents or servers use the ''Allow'' header to state which methods they support. To ''require'' the use of a particular method in a particular dialog, they must use an ''option tag'' associated to that method.

== SIP extensions  ==
=== Caller preferences and user agent capabilities ===
These two extensions allow users to specify their preferences about the service the IMS provides.

With the caller preferences extension,&lt;ref name=RFC3841 /&gt; the calling party is able to indicate the kind of user agent they want to reach (e.g. whether it is fixed or mobile, a voicemail or a human, personal or for business, which services it is capable to provide, or which methods it supports) and how to search for it, with three header fields: ''Accept-Contact'' to describe the desired destination user agents, ''Reject-Contact'' to state the user agents to avoid, and ''Request-Disposition'' to specify how the request should be handled by servers in the network (i.e. whether or not to redirect and how to search for the user: sequentially or in parallel).

By using the user agent capabilities extension,&lt;ref name=RFC3840 /&gt; user agents (terminals) can describe themselves when they register so that others can search for them according to their caller preferences extension headers. For this purpose, they list their capabilities in the ''Contact'' header field of the REGISTER message.

=== Event notification ===
The aim of event notification is to obtain the status of a given resource (e.g. a user, one's [[voicemail]] service) and to receive updates of that status when it changes.

Event notification is necessary in the IMS framework to inform about the ''presence'' of a user (i.e. "online" or "offline") to others that may be waiting to contact them, or to notify a user and its P-CSCF of its own ''registration'' state, so that they know if they are reachable and what public identities they have registered. Moreover, event notification can be used to provide additional services such as [[voicemail]] (i.e. to notify that they have new voice messages in their [[inbox]]).

To this end, the specific event notification extension&lt;ref name=RFC3265 /&gt; defines a framework for event notification in SIP, with two new methods: SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY, new header fields and response codes and two roles: the ''subscriber'' and the ''notifier''. The entity interested in the state information of a resource (the ''subscriber'') sends a SUBSCRIBE message with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the resource in the request initial line, and the type of event in the ''Event header''. Then the entity in charge of keeping track of the state of the resource (the ''notifier''), receives the SUBSCRIBE request and sends back a NOTIFY message with a ''subscription-state header'' as well as the information about the status of the resource in the message body. Whenever the resource state changes, the ''notifier'' sends a new NOTIFY message to the ''subscriber''. Each kind of event a subscriber can subscribe to is defined in a new ''event package''. An ''event package'' describes a new value for the SUBSCRIBE ''Event header'', as well as a [[MIME]] type to carry the event state information in the NOTIFY message.

There is also an ''allow-events'' header to indicate event notification capabilities, and the ''202 accepted'' and ''489 bad event'' response codes to indicate if a subscription request has been preliminary accepted or has been turned down because the ''notifier'' does not understand the kind of event requested.

In order to make an efficient use of the signaling messages, it is also possible to establish a limited notification rate (not real-time notifications) through a mechanism called ''event throttling''. Moreover, there is also a mechanism for ''conditional event notification'' that allows the ''notifier'' to decide whether or not to send the complete NOTIFY message depending on if there is something new to notify since last subscription or there is not.

==== State publication ====
The event notification framework defines how a user agent can subscribe to events about the state of a resource, but it does not specify how that state can be published. The SIP extension for event state publication&lt;ref name=RFC3903 /&gt; was defined to allow user agents to publish the state of an event to the entity (''notifier'') that is responsible for composing the event state and distributing it to the ''subscribers''.

The state publication framework defines a new method: PUBLISH, which is used to request the publication of the state of the resource specified in the request-URI, with reference to the event stated in the ''Event header'', and with the information carried in the message body.

=== Instant messaging ===
The functionality of sending instant messages to provide a service similar to [[text messaging]] is defined in the instant messaging extension.&lt;ref name=RFC3428 /&gt; These messages are unrelated to each other (i.e. they do not originate a SIP dialog) and sent through the SIP signaling network, sharing resources with control messages.

This functionality is supported by the new MESSAGE method, that can be used to send an instant message to the resource stated in the request-URI, with the content carried in the message body. This content is defined as a [[MIME]] type, being ''text/plain'' the most common one.

In order to have an instant messaging session with related messages, the [[Message Session Relay Protocol]] (MSRP)&lt;ref name=RFC4975 /&gt; should be used.

=== Call transfer ===
The REFER method extension&lt;ref name=RFC3515 /&gt; defines a mechanism to request a user agent to contact a resource which is identified by a URI in the ''Refer-To'' header field of the request message. A typical use of this mechanism is call transfer: during a call, the participant who sends the REFER message tells the recipient to contact to the user agent identified by the URI in the corresponding header field. The REFER message also implies an [[#event notification|event subscription]] to the result of the operation, so that the sender will know whether or not the recipient could contact the third person.

However, this mechanism is not restricted to call transfer, since the ''Refer-To'' header field can be any kind of URI, for instance, an [[HTTP]] URI, to require the recipient to visit a [[web page]].

=== Reliability of provisional responses ===
In the basic SIP specification,&lt;ref name=RFC3261 /&gt; only requests and final responses (i.e. 2XX [[List of SIP response codes|response codes]]) are transmitted reliably, this is, they are retransmitted by the sender until the [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledge]] message arrives (i.e. the corresponding response code to a request, or the ACK request corresponding to a 2XX response code). This mechanism is necessary since SIP can run not only over reliable transport protocols ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]) that assure that the message is delivered, but also over unreliable ones ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) that offer no delivery guarantees, and it is even possible that both kinds of protocols are present in different parts of the transport network.

However, in such an scenario as the IMS framework, it is necessary to extend this reliability to provisional responses to INVITE requests (for session establishment, this is, to start a call). The reliability of provisional responses extension&lt;ref name=RFC3262 /&gt; provides a mechanism to confirm that provisional responses such as the ''180 Ringing'' [[List of SIP response codes|response code]], that lets the caller know that the callee is being alerted, are successfully received. To do so, this extension defines a new method: PRACK, which is the request message used to tell the sender of a provisional response that his or her message has been received. This message includes a ''RACK'' header field which is a [[sequence number]] that matches the ''RSeq'' header field of the provisional response that is being acknowledged, and also contains the ''CSeq'' number that identifies the corresponding INVITE request. To indicate that the user agent requests or supports reliable provisional responses, the ''100rel'' [[#Extension negotiation mechanism|option tag]] will be used.

=== Session description updating ===
The aim of the UPDATE method extension&lt;ref name=RFC3311 /&gt; is to allow user agents to provide updated session description information within a dialog, before the final response to the initial INVITE request is generated. This can be used to negotiate and allocate the call resources before the called party is alerted.

=== Preconditions ===
In the IMS framework, it is required that once the callee is alerted, the chances of a session failure are minimum. An important source of failure is the inability to reserve network resources to support the session, so these resources should be [[Resource allocation|allocated]] before the phone rings. However, in the IMS, to reserve resources the network needs to know the callee's IP address, port and session parameters and therefore it is necessary that the initial offer/answer exchange to establish a session has started (INVITE request). In basic SIP, this exchange eventually causes the callee to be alerted. To solve this problem, the concept of preconditions&lt;ref name=RFC3312 /&gt; was introduced. In this concept the [[calling party|caller]] states a set of constraints about the session (i.e. [[codecs]] and [[Quality of service|QoS]] requirements) in the offer, and the [[called party|callee]] responds to the offer without establishing the session or alerting the user. This establishment will occur if and only if both the caller and the callee agree that the preconditions are met.

The preconditions SIP extension affects both SIP, with a new [[#Extension negotiation mechanism|option tag]] (''precondition'') and defined offer/answer exchanges, and [[Session Description Protocol]] (SDP), which is a format used to describe [[streaming media]] initialization parameters, carried in the body of SIP messages. The new SDP attributes are meant to describe the ''current status'' of the resource reservation, the ''desired status'' of the reservation to proceed with session establishment, and the ''confirmation status'', to indicate when the reservation status should be confirmed.

==== The SDP offer/answer model using PRACK and UPDATE requests ====
In the IMS, the initial session parameter negotiation can be done by using the [[#Reliability of provisional responses|provisional responses]] and [[#Session description updating|session description updating]] extensions, along with SDP in the body of the messages.
The first offer, described by means of SDP, can be carried by the INVITE request and will deal with the caller's supported [[codec]]s. This request will be answered by the provisional reliable response code [[List of SIP response codes|183 Session Progress]], that will carry the SDP list of supported codecs by both the caller and the callee. The corresponding PRACK to this provisional answer will be used to select a codec and initiate the [[Quality of service|QoS]] negotiation.

The QoS negotiation is supported by the PRACK request, that starts resource reservation in the calling party network, and it is answered by a 2XX response code. Once this response has been sent, the called party has selected the codec too, and starts resource reservation on its side. Subsequent UPDATE requests are sent to inform about the reservation progress, and they are answered by 2XX response codes. In a typical offer/answer exchange,&lt;ref name=IMSCALL /&gt; one UPDATE will be sent by the calling party when its reservation is completed, then the called party will respond and eventually finish allocating the resources. It is then, when all the resources for the call are in place, when the caller is alerted.

=== Identification and charging ===
In the IMS framework it is fundamental to handle user identities for authentication, authorization and accounting purposes. The IMS is meant to provide multimedia services over IP networks, but also needs a mechanism to charge users for it. All this functionality is supported by new special header fields.

==== P-headers ====
The Private Header Extensions to SIP,&lt;ref name=RFC7315 /&gt; also known as P-Headers, are special header fields whose applicability is limited to private networks with a certain topology and characteristics of lower [[Abstraction layer|layers]]' protocols. They were designed specifically to meet the 3GPP requirements because a more general solution was not available.

These header fields are used for a variety of purposes including charging and information about the networks a call traverses:

*''P-Charging-Vector'': A collection of charging information, such as the IMS Charging Identity (ICID) value, the address of the SIP proxy that creates the ICID value, and the Inter Operator Identifier (IOI). It may be filled during the establishment of a session or as a standalone transaction outside a dialog.
*''P-Charging-Function-Address'': The addresses of the charging functions (functional entities that receive the charging records or events) in the user's home network. It also may be filled during the establishment of a dialog or as a standalone transaction, and informs each proxy involved in a transaction.
*''P-Visited-Network-ID'': Identification string of the visited network. It is used during registrations, to indicate to the user's home network which network is providing services to a [[roaming]] user, so that the home network is able to accept the registration according to their roaming agreements.
*''P-Access-Network-Info'': Information about the access technology (the network providing the connectivity), such as the [[Radio access network|radio access technology]] and [[Cell site|cell]] identity. It is used to inform service proxies and the home network, so that they can optimize services or simply so that they can locate the user in a [[wireless]] network
*''P-Called-Party-ID'': The URI originally indicated in the request-URI of a request generated by the calling user agent. When the request reaches the registrar (S-CSCF) of the called user, the registrar re-writes the request-URI on the first line of the request with the registered contact address (i.e. IP address) of the called user, and stores the replaced request-URI in this header field. In the IMS, a user may be identified by several SIP URIs (address-of-record), for instance, a SIP URI for work and another SIP URI for personal use, and when the registrar replaces the request-URI with the effective contact address, the original request-URI must be stored so that the called party knows to which address-of-record was the invitation sent.
*''P-Associated-URI'': Additional URIs that are associated with a user that is registering. It is included in the 200 OK response to a REGISTER request to inform a user which other URIs the service provider has associated with an address-of-record (AOR) URI.

More private headers have been defined for user database accessing:

*''P-User-Database'':&lt;ref name=RFC4457 /&gt; The address of the user [[database]], this is, the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#HSS – Home Subscriber Server|Home Subscriber Server (HSS)]], that contains the profile of the user that generated a particular request. Although the HSS is a unique master database, it can be distributed into different nodes for [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliability]] and [[scalability]] reasons. In this case, a [[Subscriber location function]] (SLF) is needed to find the HSS that handles a particular user. When a user request reaches the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|I-CSCF]] at the edge of the administrative domain, this entity queries the SLF for the corresponding HSS and then, to prevent the S-CSCF from having to query the SLF again, sends the HSS address to the S-CSCF in the '''P-User-Database''' header. Then the S-CSCF will be able to directly query the HSS to get information about the user (e.g. authentication information during a registration).&lt;ref name=IMSREG /&gt; 
*''P-Profile-Key'':&lt;ref name=RFC5002 /&gt; The [[database index|key]] to be used to query the user database (HSS) for a profile corresponding to the destination SIP URI of a particular SIP request. It is transmitted among proxies to perform faster database queries: the first proxy finds the key and the others query the database by directly using the key. This is useful when Wildcarded Service Identities are used, this is, Public Service Identities that match a [[regular expression]], because the first query has to resolve the regular expression to find the key.

==== Asserted identity ====
The private extensions for asserted identity within [[computational trust|trusted]] networks&lt;ref name=RFC3325 /&gt; are designed to enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of [[Authentication|authenticated]] users, only within an administrative domain with previously agreed policies for generation, transport and usage of this identification information. These extensions also allow users to request privacy so that their identities are not spread outside the ''trust domain''. To indicate so, they must insert the privacy token ''id'' into the Privacy header field.&lt;ref name=RFC3323 /&gt;

The main functionality is supported by the ''P-Asserted-Identity'' extension header. When a proxy server receives a request from an untrusted entity and authenticates the user (i.e. verifies that the user is who he or she says that he or she is), it then inserts this header with the identity that has been authenticated, and then forwards the request as usual. This way, other proxy servers that receive this SIP request within the ''Trust Domain'' (i.e. the network of trusted entities with previously agreed security policies) can safely rely on the identity information carried in the P-Asserted-Identity header without the necessity of re-authenticating the user.

The ''P-Preferred-Identity'' extension header is also defined, so that a user with several public identities is able to tell the proxy which public identity should be included in the P-Asserted-Identity header when the user is authenticated.

Finally, when privacy is requested, proxies must withhold asserted identity information outside the trusted domain by removing P-Asserted-Identity headers before forwarding user requests to untrusted identities (outside the ''Trust Domain'').

There exist analogous extension headers for handling the identification of services of users,&lt;ref name=RFC6050 /&gt; instead of the users themselves. In this case, [[Uniform Resource Name]]s are used to identify a service (e.g. a voice call, an instant messaging session, an [[IPTV|IPTV streaming]])&lt;ref name=RFC5897 /&gt;

=== Security mechanisms ===
{{See also|IMS security}}
Access security in the IMS consists of first authenticating and authorizing the user, which is done by the S-CSCF, and then establishing secure connections between the P-CSCF and the user. There are several mechanisms to achieve this, such as:

*''[[HTTP]] [[digest access authentication]]'', which is part of the basic SIP specification &lt;ref name=RFC3261 /&gt; and leads to a [[Transport Layer Security]] connection between the user and the proxy.
*''HTTP digest access authentication using [[AKA (security)|AKA]]'',&lt;ref name=RFC3310 /&gt; a more secure version of the previous mechanism for [[cellular network]]s that uses the information from the user's [[smart card]] and commonly creates two [[IPsec]] security associations between the P-CSCF and the terminal.

The security mechanisms agreement extension for SIP&lt;ref name=RFC3329 /&gt; was then introduced to provide a secure mechanism for negotiating the security algorithms and parameters to be used by the P-CSCF and the terminal. This extension uses three new header fields to support the negotiation process:

*First, the terminal adds a ''security–client'' header field containing the mechanisms, authentication and encryption algorithms it supports to the REGISTER request.
*Then, the P-CSCF adds a ''security-server'' header field to the response that contains the same information as the client's but with reference to the P-CSCF. In case there are more than one mechanism, they are associated with a priority value.
*Finally, the user agent sends a new REGISTER request over the just created secure connection with the negotiated parameters, including a '''security-verify''' header field that carries the same contents as the previously received ''security-server'' header field. This procedure protects the negotiation mechanism from [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s: if an attacker removed the strongest security mechanisms from the ''Security-Server'' header field in order to force the terminal to choose weaker security algorithms, then the ''Security-Verify'' and ''Security-Server'' header fields would not match. The contents of the ''Security-Verify'' header field cannot be altered as they are sent through the new established secure association, as long as this association is no breakable by the attacker in real time (i.e. before the P-CSCF discovers the [[Man-in-the-middle attack]] in progress.

==== Media authorization ====
The necessity in the IMS of reserving resources to provide [[quality of service]] (QoS) leads to another security issue: admission control and protection against [[denial-of-service attack]]s. To obtain transmission resources, the user agent must present an authorization token to the network (i.e. the policy enforcement point, or PEP) . This token will be obtained from its P-CSCF, which may be in charge of QoS policy control or have an interface with the policy control entity in the network (i.e. the policy decision function, or PDF) which originally provides the authorization token.

The private extensions for media authorization&lt;ref name=RFC3313 /&gt; link session signaling to the QoS mechanisms applied to media in the network, by defining the mechanisms for obtaining authorization tokens and the ''P-Media-Authorization'' header field to carry these tokens from the P-CSCF to the user agent. This extension is only applicable within administrative domains with [[Computational trust|trust]] relationships. It was particularly designed for specialized SIP networks like the IMS, and not for the general [[Internet]].

=== Source-routing mechanisms ===
[[Source routing]] is the mechanism that allows the sender of a message to specify partially or completely the route the message traverses. In SIP, the ''route'' header field, filled by the sender, supports this functionality by listing a set of proxies the message will visit. In the IMS context, there are certain network entities (i.e. certain [[IP Multimedia Subsystem#CSCF – Call Session Control Function|CSCFs]]) that must be traversed by requests from or to a user, so they are to be listed in the ''Route'' header field. To allow the sender to discover such entities and populate the ''route'' header field, there are mainly two extension header fields: ''path'' and ''service-route''.

==== Path ====
The extension header field for registering non-adjacent contacts&lt;ref name=RFC3327 /&gt; provides a ''Path'' header field which accumulates and transmits the SIP URIs of the proxies that are situated between a user agent and its registrar as the REGISTER message traverses then. This way, the registrar is able to discover and record the sequence of proxies that must be transited to get back to the user agent.

In the IMS every user agent is served by its P-CSCF, which is discovered by using the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] or an equivalent mechanism when the user enters the IMS network, and all requests and responses from or to the user agent must traverse this proxy. When the user registers to the home registrar (S-CSCF), the P-CSCF adds its own SIP URI in a ''Path'' header field in the REGISTER message, so that the S-CSCF receives and stores this information associated with the contact information of the user. This way, the S-CSCF will forward every request addressed to that user through the corresponding P-CSCF by listing its URI in the ''route'' header field.

==== Service route ====
The extension for service route discovery during registration&lt;ref name=RFC3608 /&gt; consists of a ''Service-Route'' header field that is used by the registrar in a 2XX response to a REGISTER request to inform the registering user of the entity that must forward every request originated by him or her.

In the IMS, the registrar is the home network's S-CSCF and it is also required that all requests are handled by this entity, so it will include its own SIP URI in the ''service-route'' header field. The user will then include this SIP URI in the ''Route'' header field of all his or her requests, so that they are forwarded through the home S-CSCF.

=== Globally routable user agent URIs ===
In the IMS it is possible for a user to have multiple terminals (e.g. a [[mobile phone]], a [[computer]]) or application instances (e.g. [[video telephony]], [[instant messaging]], [[voice mail]]) that are identified with the same public identity (i.e. SIP URI). Therefore, a mechanism is needed in order to route requests to the desired device or application. That is what a ''Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRU)''&lt;ref name=RFC5627 /&gt; is: a URI that identifies a specific user agent instance (i.e. terminal or application instance) and it does it globally (i.e. it is valid to route messages to that user agent from any other user agent on the Internet).

These URIs are constructed by adding the ''gr'' parameter to a SIP URI, either to the public SIP URI with a value that identifies the user agent instance, or to a specially created URI that does not reveal the relationship between the GRUU and the user's identity, for privacy purposes. They are commonly obtained during the registration process: the registering user agent sends a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) that uniquely identifies that SIP instance, and the registrar (i.e. S-CSCF) builds the GRUU, associates it to the registered identity and SIP instance and sends it back to the user agent in the response. When the S-CSCF receives a request for that GRUU, it will be able to route the request to the registered SIP instance.

=== Signaling compression ===
The efficient use of network resources, which may include a [[Cellular network|radio interface]] or other low-bandwidth access, is essential in the IMS in order to provide the user with an acceptable experience in terms of [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. To achieve this goal, SIP messages can be [[Data compression|compressed]] using the mechanism known as ''SigComp''&lt;ref name=RFC3320 /&gt; (signaling compression).

Compression algorithms perform this operation by substituting repeated words in the message by its position in a [[Dictionary coder|dictionary]] where all these words only appear once. In a first approach, this dictionary may be built for each message by the compressor and sent to the decompressor along with the message itself. However, as many words are repeated in different messages, the extended operations for ''SigComp''&lt;ref name=RFC3321 /&gt; define a way to use a shared dictionary among subsequent messages. Moreover, in order to speed up the process of building a dictionary along subsequent messages and provide high [[Data compression ratio|compression ratios]] since the first INVITE message, SIP provides a static SIP/SDP dictionary &lt;ref name=RFC3485 /&gt; which is already built with common SIP and SDP terms.

There is a mechanism&lt;ref name=RFC3486 /&gt; to indicate that a SIP message is desired to be compressed. This mechanism defines the ''comp=sigcomp'' parameter for SIP URIs, which signals that the SIP entity identified by the URI supports ''SigComp'' and is willing to receive compressed messages. When used in request-URIs, it indicates that the request is to be compressed, while in Via header fields it signals that the subsequent response is to be compressed.

==== Content Indirection ====
In order to obtain even shorter SIP messages and make a very efficient use of the resources, the content indirection extension&lt;ref name=RFC4483 /&gt; makes it possible to replace a [[MIME]] body part of the message with an external reference, typically an [[HTTP]] URI. This way the recipient of the message can decide whether or not to follow the reference to fetch the resource, depending on the bandwidth available.

=== NAT traversal ===
[[Network address translation]] (NAT) makes it impossible for a terminal to be reached from outside its [[private network]], since it uses a private address that is mapped to a public one when packets originated by the terminal cross the NAT. Therefore, [[NAT traversal]] mechanisms are needed for both the [[signaling plane]] and the [[media plane]].

[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s [[Request for Comments|RFC 6314]]&lt;ref name=RFC6314 /&gt; summarizes and unifies different methods to achieve this, such as symmetric response routing and client-initiated connections for SIP signaling, and the use of [[STUN]], [[TURN]] and [[Interactive Connectivity Establishment|ICE]], which combines both previous ones, for [[Streaming media|media stream]]s

=== Internet Protocol version 6 compatibility ===
[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s [[Request for Comments|RFC 6157]]&lt;ref name=RFC6157 /&gt; describes the necessary mechanisms to guarantee that SIP works successfully between both [[Internet Protocol]] versions during the [[IPv6 deployment|transition]] to [[IPv6]]. While SIP signaling messages can be transmitted through heterogeneous [[IPv4]]/[[IPv6]] networks as long as proxy servers and [[DNS]] entries are properly configured to relay messages across both networks according to these recommendations, user agents will need to implement extensions so that they can directly exchange [[Streaming media|media streams]]. These extensions are related to the [[Session Description Protocol]] offer/answer initial exchange, that will be used to gather the IPv4 and IPv6 [[IP address|addresses]] of both ends so that they can establish a direct communication.

=== Interworking with other technologies ===
Apart from all the explained extensions to SIP that make it possible for the IMS to work successfully, it is also necessary that the IMS framework interworks and exchanges services with existing network infrastructures, mainly the [[Public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

There are several standards that address this requirements, such as the following two for services interworking between the PSTN and the [[Internet]] (i.e. the IMS network):
*''[[PSTN Interworking Service Protocol]] (PINT)'',&lt;ref name=RFC2848 /&gt; that extends SIP and SDP for accessing classic telephone call services in the PSTN (e.g. basic telephone calls, fax service, receiving content over the telephone).
*''[[Services in PSTN requesting Internet Services]] (SPIRITS)'',&lt;ref name=RFC3910 /&gt; that provides the opposite functionality to PINT, this is, supporting the access to Internet services from the PSTN.

And also for PSTN-SIP gateways to support calls with one end in each network:
*''Session Initiation Protocol for Telephones (SIP-T)'',&lt;ref name=RFC3372 /&gt; that describes the practices and uses of these gateways.
*''ISDN User Part (ISUP) to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Mapping'',&lt;ref name=RFC3398 /&gt; which makes it possible to translate SIP signaling messages into [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] messages of the [[Signaling System No. 7]] (SS7) which is used in the PSTN, and vice versa.

Moreover, the SIP INFO method extension is designed to carry user information between terminals without affecting the signaling dialog and can be used to transport the [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] to provide [[telephone keypad]] function for users.&lt;ref name=RFC6086 /&gt;

In addition, high-tech clusters can be found in [[Haifa]] and [[Caesarea, Israel|Caesarea]]. More recent high-tech establishments have been raised in [[Jerusalem]], and in towns such as [[Yokneam Illit]] and Israel's first "private city," Airport City, near Tel Aviv.

==Origin of the term==
Silicon Wadi is a pun based on the [[California]]n region of [[Silicon Valley]]. "[[Wadi]]" is the Arabic word for a valley or dry river bed, also commonly used in colloquial [[Hebrew]].

==History==
Israeli high-tech firms originally began to form in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; In 1961 [[ECI Telecom]] was founded, followed in 1962 by [[Tadiran]] and [[Elron Electronic Industries]] regarded by many to be the "Fairchild of Israel."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The number of internationally successful firms grew slowly, with only one or two new successful firms each year until the early 1990s. [[Motorola]] was the first US corporation to set up an R&amp;D unit in Israel, in 1964.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The center initially developed wireless products including remote irrigation systems and later developed leading chips such as the 68030.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Following the 1967 French arms embargo, Israel was forced to develop a domestic military industry, focusing on developing a technological edge over its neighbors.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Some of these military firms started to seek and develop civilian applications of military technology.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; In the 1970s more commercial innovations began, many of which were based on military R&amp;D, including: [[Scitex]] digital printing systems, which were based on fast rotation drums from fast-rotation electronic warfare systems,&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; and [[Elscint]], which developed innovative [[medical imaging]] and became a leading force in its market.&lt;ref name=fu&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Elscint-Ltd-Company-History.html Elscint Ltd. - Company history] FundingUniverse&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech firms continued to struggle throughout this period with marketing and many products, such as a mini-computer developed in the 1970s by [[Elbit]], who were unable to successfully commercialise the product.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

===World software market takes off===
Slowly, the international computing industry shifted the emphasis from hardware (in which Israel had no comparative advantage) to software products (in which human capital plays a larger role).&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The country became one of the first nations to compete in global software markets.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; By the 1980s a diverse set of software firms had developed. Each found niches which were not dominated by US firms and between 1984 and 1991 "pure" software exports increased from $5 million to $110 million. Many of the important ideas here were developed by graduates of [[Mamram]], the Israeli computer corps, established by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

During the 1980s and early 1990s several successful software companies emerged from Israel, including: [[Amdocs]] (established in 1982 as Aurec Information), [[Cimatron]] (established in 1982), [[Magic Software Enterprises]] (established in 1983), [[Comverse]] (established in 1983 as Efrat Future Technologies), [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]] (established in 1985), [[NICE Systems]]  (established in 1986), [[Mercury Interactive]] (established in 1989) and [[Check Point|Check Point Software Technologies]] (established in 1993).

The 1990s saw the real takeoff of high-tech industries in Israel, with international media attention increasing awareness of innovation in the country.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Growth increased, whilst new [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1990s|immigrants from the Soviet Union]] increased the available high-tech workforce.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Peace agreements including the 1993 [[Oslo Peace Accord]] increased the investment environment and Silicon Wadi began to develop into a noticeable high-tech cluster.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

===Dot-com boom===
In 1998, Mirabilis, an [[Israel]]i company that developed the [[ICQ]] [[instant messaging]] program, which revolutionized communication over the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.themarker.com/47-yair-goldfinger-serial-entrepreneur-an-intensely-private-technology-angel-1.382778 Yair Goldfinger, serial entrepreneur / An intensely private technology angel, [[The Marker]] ]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was purchased by [[America Online]] (AOL) for $407 million in cash, 18 months after it was founded and having no revenues. The free service attracted a user base of 15 million in that period and by 2001, ICQ had over 100 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the ICQ experiment working?|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-257294.html|newspaper=CNET News|date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Mirabilis triggered the [[dot-com boom]] in Israel; thousands of start-up companies were established between 1998 and 2001, while [[venture capital]] raised by Israeli companies reached $1,851 million in 1999, peaking at $3,701 million in 2000. Over fifty Israeli companies had [[initial public offering]]s on [[NASDAQ]] and other international stock markets during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/41/56/2491258.pdf|title=Page not found|work=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Wadi today===
For more than 50 years, local demand fueled Israeli industrial expansion, as the country's population grew rapidly and the standard of living rose. More recently, world demand for Israeli advanced technologies, software, electronics, and other sophisticated equipment has stimulated industrial growth. Israel's high status in new technologies is the result of its emphasis on [[higher education]] and research and development. Cultural factors contributing to the expansion includes [[chutzpah]] and openness to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Chutzpah of Israeli Startups, {{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/05/chutzpah-of-israeli-startups/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208121328/http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/05/chutzpah-of-israeli-startups/ |archivedate=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government also assists industrial growth by providing low-rate loans from its development budget. The main limitations experienced by industry are the scarcity of domestic raw materials and sources of energy and the restricted size of the local market. One certain advantage is that many Israeli university graduates are likely to become IT entrepreneurs or join startups, about twice as much as US university graduates, who are also attracted to traditional corporate executive positions, according to [[Charles A. Holloway]], co-director of the [[Center for Entrepreneurial Studies]] and a professor at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13769/edition_id/266/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Silicon Wadi not that far from Silicon Valley, prof says|work=[[j.]]|first=Buzzy|last=Gordon|date=26 May 2000|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICQ]], for instance, is one of the world's most famous Israeli software products, developed by 4 young entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobcircle.com/career/articles/x/njtc/2934.xml New Jersey Technology Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928213113/http://jobcircle.com/career/articles/x/njtc/2934.xml |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has its IBM Content Discovery Engineering Team in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs"&gt;[http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/jerusalem_facility.html IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701012401/http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/jerusalem_facility.html |date=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of a number of [[IBM R&amp;D Labs in Israel]].

===Genealogical research===
According to research conducted by Prof. Shmuel Ellis, Chair of the Management Department at [[Tel Aviv University]]'s Faculty of Management, together with Prof. Israel Drori of the School of Business Administration at the College of Management and Prof. Zur Shapira, Chair of the Management and Organizations Department at [[New York University]], the [[RAD Group]], founded in 1981 by brothers Yehuda and [[Zohar Zisapel]], has been "the most fertile ground" for creating Israeli entrepreneurs, having produced 56 "serial entrepreneurs" who established more than one start-up each. [[RAD Group]] "graduates" were responsible for the establishment of a total of 111 significant high-tech initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mother of the Start-Ups: The RAD Group Gave Birth to 110 Companies|newspaper=The Marker|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the small size of Israel, the concentration of high-tech firms across much of the country is enough for it to be recognised as one large cluster. Most activity is located in the densely populated areas of metropolitan [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]] ([[Matam, Haifa|Matam]]), and Jerusalem ([[Jerusalem Technology Park|Technology Park, Malha]], [[Har Hotzvim]] and [[Jerusalem Venture Partners|JVP Media Quarter]] in [[Talpiot]]), and the [[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area]], although some secondary with additional activity include the corridor to [[Beer Sheba]], including [[Kiryat Gat]], and the Western Galilee. In all, this is an area no larger than 6000 square kilometers, half of the extended Silicon Valley's geographical coverage.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;Catherine de Fontenay and Erran Carmel, [http://www.mbs.edu/home/defontenay/IsraelSiliconWadiJune2002.pdf Israel’s Silicon Wadi: The forces behind cluster formation], June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Many international technology companies have [[research and development]] facilities in this region, including companies such as [[Intel]], [[IBM]],&lt;ref name="IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs"/&gt; [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Philips]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[BMC Software]], [[Microsoft]], [[Motorola]] and [[CA, Inc.|CA]]. Many Israeli high-tech companies are based in the region, including [[Zoran Corporation]], [[CEVA, Inc.]], [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]], [[Mellanox]], [[NICE Systems]], Horizon Semiconductors, [[RAD Data Communications]], [[Radwin|RADWIN]], [[Radware]], [[Tadiran Telecom]], [[Radvision Ltd.|Radvision]], [[Check Point|Check Point Software Technologies]], [[Amdocs]], [[Babylon (program)|Babylon Ltd.]], [[Elbit]], [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] and the solar thermal equipment designer and manufacturer [[Solel]], with most of them being listed on the [[NASDAQ]], which even has an Israel Index. Intel developed its [[dual-core]] [[Intel Core 2|Core Duo]] processor at its Israel Development Center located at the ''Merkaz Ta'asiya ve'Meida'' ([[Matam, Haifa|Matam - Scientific Industries Center]]) in the city of [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isrealli.org/israel-saves-intel Israel Saves Intel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824020303/http://www.isrealli.org/israel-saves-intel |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 3,000 [[startup company|start-ups]] were created in Israel, a number that is only second to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/090e5dd2-e88e-11db-b2c3-000b5df10621.html|title=Business as usual|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek Magazine]] has also named [[Tel Aviv]] as one of the world's top ten "Hot High-Tech Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelemb.org/chicago/newsleter.htm|title=Error-2010-f3|work=israelemb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Tel Aviv]] was named by ''[[Newsweek]]'' as one of the ten technologically most influential cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Economy/telaviv.html |title=Tel Aviv One of The World’s Top High-Tech Centers |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the city was also named one of the best places for high-tech startup companies, placed only second behind its [[Silicon Valley|California counterpart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-11-21-after-silicon-valley-tel-aviv-ranks-best-for-tech-startups-study/ | work=Bloomberg | title=After Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv Ranks Best for Tech Startups: Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israel21c.org/news/tel-aviv-named-top-startup-center/|title=Tel Aviv named top startup center|work=ISRAEL21c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance===
The importance of Silicon Wadi was first recognised internationally by Wired magazine, who in 2000, ranked locations by the strength of cluster effects, giving the Israeli high-tech cluster the same rank as Boston, Helsinki, London, and Kista in Sweden, second only to Silicon Valley.

===Sectors===
* A cluster of software companies, who are monetizing "free" software downloads by [[adware]] or altering user's systems, has been dubbed [[Download Valley]].&lt;ref name=Inbal&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hirschauge |first1=Orr |title=Conduit Diversifies Away From 'Download Valley' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/conduit-seeks-diversifies-away-from-download-valley-1400152825?tesla=y |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orpaz |first1=Inbal |last2=Smolsky |first2=Raz |title=Amazon to Expand Its Operations in Israel |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-amazon-to-expand-its-operations-in-israel-1.5371061 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli venture capital industry==
{{main article|Venture capital in Israel}}
[[File:Madpis.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] (JVP) compound in [[Jerusalem]], one of Israel's largest Venture Capital firms.]]
The origins of the now thriving venture capital industry in Israel can be traced to a government initiative in 1993 named the Yozma program ("Initiative" in Hebrew); which offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture-capital investments in Israel and offered to double any investment with funds from the government.&lt;ref name=Gilder&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Between 1991 and 2000, Israel's annual venture-capital outlays, nearly all private, rose nearly 60-fold, from $58 million to $3.3 billion; companies launched by Israeli venture funds rose from 100 to 800; and Israel's information-technology revenues rose from $1.6 billion to $12.5 billion. By 1999, Israel ranked second only to the United States in invested private-equity capital as a share of GDP. And it led the world in the share of its growth attributable to high-tech ventures: 70 percent.&lt;ref name="Gilder"/&gt;

Israel's thriving venture capital industry has played an important role in financing and funding Silicon Wadi. The [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired.&lt;ref name=VC&gt;[http://www.investinisrael.gov.il/NR/exeres/A19A138D-87A7-416B-8D62-1C968E035E13.htm Venture Capital in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218080510/http://www.investinisrael.gov.il/NR/exeres/A19A138D-87A7-416B-8D62-1C968E035E13.htm |date=18 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous high tech Israeli companies have been acquired by global corporations for its provision of reliable and quality corporate personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfunders.org/sites/default/files/docs/events/briefing_book_final.pdf |title=FUNDING THE FUTURE: Advancing STEM in Israeli Education |publisher=STEM Israel |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's venture capital industry has about 70 active venture capital funds, of which 14 international VCs with Israeli offices. Additionally, there are some 220 international funds, including [[Polaris Venture Partners]], [[Accel Partners]] and [[Greylock Partners]], that do not have branches in Israel, but actively invest in Israel through an in-house specialist.

In 2009, the [[life sciences]] sector led the market with $272 million or 24% of total capital raised, followed by the [[software]] sector with $258 million or 23%, the [[communications]] sector with $219 million or 20%, and the [[Internet]] sector with 13% of capital raised in 2009.&lt;ref name="VC"/&gt;

With such an impressive record for creating profit driven technology, Israel has become the top choice for many business leaders and high technology industry giants. As of 2010, more than 35,000 personnel are employed in multinationals research and development centers across Israel, making 'Silicon Wadi' a source for worldwide strategic technology development. In recent years, East Asian multinationals and investors, especially from Mainland China, have actively invested and opened up offices in Israel, including Chinese technology giants such as [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], [[Baidu]], [[Tencent]] and [[Kuang-Chi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/china-is-increasingly-becoming-key-for-israels-high-tech-industry.html|title=China is increasingly becoming key for Israel's high-tech industry|last=Biedermann|first=Ferry|date=18 July 2017|work=CNBC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 60 foreign R&amp;D centers are engaged in a diverse range of activities including biotechnology, chemicals, industrial machinery, communication equipment, scientific instruments, medical devices, flash memory storage equipment, computer hardware components, software, semiconductors and internet.

The benefits of single-source publishing primarily relate to the editor rather than the [[User (computing)|user]]. The user benefits from the consistency that single-sourcing brings to terminology and information. This assumes the content manager has applied an organized [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]] to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful).&lt;ref name=petra/&gt; Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with '''multi-channel publishing''' though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.&lt;ref name=mek&gt;[http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards Single-Source &amp; Multi-Channel Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406072258/http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards |date=2010-04-06 }}. © 2013 Mekon, accessed 23 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
While there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different [[file format]]s or human [[language]]s (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.&lt;ref name=mek/&gt;

==History==
The origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bob162&gt;Bob Boiko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6nUDn3ZaBoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Content Management Bible], pg. 162. [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780764583643}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the eclipsing of [[MS-DOS]] by [[graphical user interface]]s, help files went from being unreadable text along the bottom of the screen to hypertext systems such as [[WinHelp]]. On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of [[software documentation]] did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of [[electronic publishing]], but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.&lt;ref name=bob162/&gt;

The first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at [[Schneider Electric]] in [[Seligenstadt]], using software based on [[Interleaf]] to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=inCeft4AkXcC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge Strategies for Going Multilingual in a Global Age], pg. 227. Eds. Robert C. Sprung and Simone Jaroniec. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9789027231871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[XML]], developed during the mid- to late-1990s, was also significant to the development of single-source publishing as a method. XML, a markup language, allows developers to separate their documentation into two layers: a shell-like layer based on presentation and a core-like layer based on the actual written content. This method allows developers to write the content only one time while switching it in and out of multiple different formats and delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Wallace and Anthony Levinson, "The XML e-Learning Revolution: Is Your Production Model Holding You Back?" Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=4RK7tJ-OO3cC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Best of The eLearning Guild's Learning Solutions: Articles from the eMagazine's First Five Years], pg. 63. Ed. Bill Brandon. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. {{ISBN|9780470277157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, several firms began creating and using single-source content for technical documentation (Boeing Helicopter, Sikorsky Aviation and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) and user manuals (Ford owners manuals) based on tagged SGML and XML content generated using the Arbortext Epic editor with add-on functions developed by a contractor.  The concept behind this usage was that complex, hierarchical content that did not lend itself to discrete componentization could be used across a variety of requirements by tagging the differences within a single document using the capabilities built into SGML and XML.
Ford, for example, was able to tag its single owner's manual files so that 12 model years could be generated via a resolution script running on the single completed file.  Pratt &amp; Whitney, likewise, was able to tag up to 20 subsets of its jet engine manuals in single-source files, calling out the desired version at publication time.  World Book Encyclopedia also used the concept to tag its articles for American and British versions of English.

Starting from the early 2000s, single-source publishing was used with an increasing frequency in the field of [[technical translation]]. It is still regarded as the most efficient method of publishing the same material in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Esselink, "Localisation and translation." Taken from [https://books.google.com/books?id=a4W7lWgCqYoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Computers and Translation: A Translator's Guide], pg. 73. Ed. H. L. Somers. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2003. {{ISBN|9789027216403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a printed manual was translated, for example, the online help for the software program which the manual accompanies could be automatically generated using the method.&lt;ref&gt;Burt Esselink, ''A Practical Guide to Localization'', pg. 228. Volume 4 of Language international world directory. [[Amsterdam]]: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2000. {{ISBN|9781588110060}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metadata]] could be created for an entire manual and individual pages or files could then be translated from that metadata with only one step, removing the need to recreate information or even database structures.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Hofmann and Thorsten Mehnert, "Multilingual Information Management at Schneider Automation." Taken from ''Translating Into Success'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although single-source publishing is now decades old, its importance has increased urgently as of the 2010s. As consumption of information products rises and the number of target audiences expands, so does the work of developers and content creators. Within the industry of software and its documentation, there is a perception that the choice is to embrace single-source publishing or render one's operations obsolete.&lt;ref name=cms/&gt;

==Criticism==
Editors using single-source publishing have been criticized for below-standard work quality, leading some critics to describe single-source publishing as the "conveyor belt assembly" of content creation.&lt;ref&gt;Mick Hiatt, [http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ The Myth of Single-Source Authoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929043721/http://mashstream.com/mashups/the-myth-of-single-source-authoring/ |date=2013-09-29 }}. Mashstream, November 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While heavily used in technical translation, there are risks of error in regard to [[Index (publishing)|indexing]]. While two words might be [[synonym]]s in English, they may not be synonyms in another language. In a document produced via single-sourcing, the index will be translated automatically and the two words will be rendered as synonyms. This is because they are synonyms in the [[Source language (translation)|source language]], while in the [[Target language (translation)|target language]] they are not.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Mulvany, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G0Eqm8FbiTMC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=single+source+publishing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=single%20source%20publishing&amp;f=false Indexing Books], pg. 154. 2nd ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10257">'''Social translucence''' (also referred as ''social awareness'') is a term that was proposed by Thomas Erickson and [[Wendy Kellogg]] to refer to "design digital systems that support coherent behavior by making participants and their activities visible to one another".

Social translucence represents a tool for [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in socio-technical systems, which function is to
* stimulate [[online participation]]
* facilitate collaboration (via [[collaborative filtering]] but also by helping the construction of trust)

Social translucence is, in particular, a core element in [[online social networking]] such as [[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]], in which they intervene in the possibility for people to expose their [[online identity]], but also in the creation of awareness of other people activities, that are for instance present in the [[Activity stream|activity feed]]s that these systems make available.

Social translucence mechanisms have been made available in many [[web 2.0]] systems such as:

==Background==

Participation of people in online communities, in general, differ from their participatory behavior in real-world collective contexts. Humans in daily life are used to making use of "social cues" for guiding their decisions and actions e.g. if a group of people is looking for a good restaurant to have lunch, it is very likely that they will choose to enter to a local that have some customers inside instead of one that it is empty (the more crowded restaurant could reflect its popularity and in consequence, its quality of service). However, in online social environments, it is not straightforward how to access to these sources of information which are normally being logged in the systems, but this is not disclosed to the users.

There are some theories that explain how this social translucence can affect the behavior of people in real-life scenarios. The American philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]] states that humans are social creatures, in the sense that people's actions cannot be isolated from the behavior of the whole collective they are part of because every individuals' acts are influenced by larger social practices that act as a general behavior's framework.&lt;ref name="Mead1934"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George. H.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1934|isbn=|location=Chicago|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his performance framework, the Canadian sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] postulates that in everyday social interactions individuals perform their actions by collecting information from others first, in order to know in advance what they may expect from them and in this way being able to plan how to behave more effectively.&lt;ref name="Goffman 1990 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Goffman | first=Erving | title=The presentation of self in everyday life | publisher=Penguin | location=London | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-14-013571-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

According to Erickson et al., social translucent systems should respect the principles of visibility (making significant social information available to users), awareness (bringing our social rules to guide our actions based on external social cues) and accountability (being able to identify who did what and when) in order to allow people to effectively facilitate users communication and collaboration in virtual environments.&lt;ref name="Erickson Kellogg pp. 59–83"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Erickson | first=Thomas | last2=Kellogg | first2=Wendy A. | title=Social translucence: an approach to designing systems that support social processes | journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction | publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) | volume=7 | issue=1 | date=2000-03-01 | issn=1073-0516 | doi=10.1145/344949.345004 | pages=59–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zolyomi et al. proposed the principle of identity as a fourth dimension for social translucence by arguing that the design of socio-technical systems should have a rich description of who is visible, in order to give people control over disclosure and mechanisms to advocate for their needs.&lt;ref name="Zolyomi Ross Bhattacharya Milne 2018 p. "&gt;{{cite conference | last=Zolyomi | first=Annuska | last2=Ross | first2=Anne Spencer | last3=Bhattacharya | first3=Arpita | last4=Milne | first4=Lauren | last5=Munson | first5=Sean A. | title=Values, Identity, and Social Translucence | publisher=ACM Press | publication-place=New York, New York, USA | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-4503-5620-6 | doi=10.1145/3173574.3174073 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald et al. proposed a system architecture for structuring the development of social translucent systems, which comprises two dimensions: types of user actions in the system, and a second describing the processing and interpretation done by the system. This framework can guide designers to determine what activities are important to social translucence and need to be reflected, and how interpretive levels of those actions might provide contextual salience to the users &lt;ref name="McDonald Gokhman Zachry 2012 p. "/&gt;

==Effects==

===Benefits===

In the same way that in the real-world, providing social cues in virtual communities can help people to understand better the situations they face in these environments, to alleviate their decision-making processes by enabling their access to more informed choices, to persuade them to participate in the activities that take place there, and to structure their own schedule of individual and group activities more efficiently.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Xianghua|last2=Erickson|first2=Thomas|last3=Kellogg|first3=Wendy A.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald J.|title=Informing and performing: investigating how mediated sociality becomes visible|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|volume=16|issue=8|year=2011|pages=1095–1117|issn=1617-4909|doi=10.1007/s00779-011-0443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this frame of reference, an approach called "social context displays" has been proposed for showing social information -either from real or virtual environments- in digital scenarios. It is based on the use of graphical representations to visualize the presence and activity traces of a group of people, thus providing users with a third-party view of what is happening within the community i.e. who are actively participating, who are not contributing to the group efforts, etc. This social-context-revealing approach has been studied in different scenarios (e.g. IBM video-conference software, large community displaying social activity traces in a shared space called NOMATIC*VIZ), and it has been demonstrated that its application can provide users with several benefits, like providing them with more information to make better decisions and motivating them to take an active attitude towards the management of  their self and group representations within the display through their actions in the real-life.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

The feeling of personal accountability in front of others that social translucence can report to users can be used for the design of systems for supporting behavior change (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation), if combined with the appropriate type of feedback.&lt;ref name="Barreto Szóstek Karapanos 2013 p. "&gt;{{cite conference | last=Barreto | first=Mary | last2=Szóstek | first2=Agnieszka | last3=Karapanos | first3=Evangelos | title=An initial model for designing socially translucent systems for behavior change | publisher=ACM Press | publication-place=New York, New York, USA | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4503-2061-0 | doi=10.1145/2499149.2499162 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===

By making the traces of activity of users publicly available for others to access it is natural that it can raise users concerns related to which are their rights over the data they generate, who are the final users that can have access to their information and how they can know and control their privacy policies.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt; There are several perspectives that try to contextualize this privacy issue. One perspective is to see privacy as a tradeoff between the degree of invasion to the personal space and the number of benefits that the user could perceive from the social system by disclosing their online activity traces.&lt;ref name="PatilLai2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Sameer|last2=Lai|first2=Jennifer|title=Who gets to know what when: configuring privacy permissions in an awareness application|year=2005|pages=101|doi=10.1145/1054972.1054987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective is examining the concession between the visibility of people within the social system and their level of privacy, which can be managed at an individual or at a group level by establishing specific permissions for allowing others to have access to their information. Other authors state that instead of enforcing users to set and control privacy settings, social systems might focus on raising their awareness about who their audiences are so they can manage their online behavior according to the reactions they expect from those different user groups.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

At the bottom of the tall diagram is the Earth as viewed from high above the North Pole. About six earth-radii above the Earth an arc is drawn with the same center as the Earth.  The arc  depicts the level of geosynchronous orbit.  About twice as high as the arc and directly above the Earth's center, a counterweight is depicted by a small square.  A line depicting the space elevator's cable connects the counterweight to the equator directly below it.  The system's center of mass is described as above the level of geosynchronous orbit.  The center of mass is shown roughly to be about a quarter of the way up from the geosynchronous arc to the counterweight.  The bottom of the cable is indicated to be anchored at the equator.  A climber is depicted by a small rounded square.  The climber is shown climbing the cable about one third of the way from the ground to the arc. Another note indicates that the cable rotates along with the Earth's daily rotation, and remains vertical. |A space elevator is conceived as a cable fixed to the equator and reaching into space.  A counterweight at the upper end keeps the [[center of mass]] well above geostationary orbit level. This produces enough upward [[centrifugal force]] from Earth's rotation to fully counter the downward gravity, keeping the cable upright and taut.  Climbers carry cargo up and down the cable.]]

A '''space elevator''' is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isec.org/index.php/what-is-a-space-elevator |title=What is a Space Elevator? |publisher=The International Space Elevator Consortium |date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main component would be a cable (also called a [[space tether|tether]]) anchored to the surface and extending into space. The design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface, such as the Earth's, directly into space or orbit, [[non-rocket spacelaunch|without the use of large rockets]]. An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond [[geostationary orbit]] (35,786&amp;nbsp;km altitude). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth.  With the tether deployed, climbers could repeatedly climb the tether to space by mechanical means, releasing their cargo to orbit.  Climbers could also descend the tether to return cargo to the surface from orbit.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Bradley Carl.

The concept of a tower reaching geosynchronous orbit was first published in 1895 by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/35657/Space_Elevator_Gets_Lift.html|title = Space Elevator Gets Lift|accessdate = September 13, 2007|last = Hirschfeld|first = Bob|date = January 31, 2002 |publisher = [[TechTV]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050608080057/http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/35657/Space_Elevator_Gets_Lift.html|archivedate = June 8, 2005|quote = The concept was first described in 1895 by Russian author K. E. Tsiolkovsky in his 'Speculations about Earth and Sky and on Vesta.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His proposal was for a free-standing tower reaching from the surface of Earth to the height of geostationary orbit. Like all buildings, Tsiolkovsky's structure would be under [[Compression (physical)|compression]], supporting its weight from below. Since 1959, most ideas for space elevators have focused on purely [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] structures, with the weight of the system held up from above by centrifugal forces. In the tensile concepts, a [[space tether]] reaches from a large mass (the counterweight) beyond geostationary orbit to the ground. This structure is held in tension between Earth and the counterweight like an upside-down [[plumb bob]].

To construct a space elevator on Earth, the cable material would need to be both stronger and lighter (have greater [[specific strength]]) than any known material. Development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement must happen before designs can progress beyond discussion stage. [[Carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) have been identified as possibly being able to meet the specific strength requirements for an Earth space elevator.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCfuture&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150211-space-elevators-a-lift-too-far |title=Should We give up on the dream of space elevators? |first=Nic |last=Fleming |date=February 15, 2015 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials considered have been [[boron nitride nanotube]]s, and [[carbon nanothread|diamond nanothreads]], which were first constructed in 2014.&lt;ref name=SCIAM_DN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Xtech_DN /&gt;

A prototype was launched in 2018 to tether to future stations as well as the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/japan-to-conduct-first-test-as-part-of-space-elevator-project/&lt;/ref&gt; It is a miniature version to be further examined before making the decision to build up a large structure in the coming years. 

The concept is applicable to other planets and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. For locations in the solar system with weaker gravity than Earth's (such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]), the strength-to-density requirements for tether materials are not as problematic. Currently available materials (such as [[Kevlar]]) are strong and light enough that they could be used as the tether material for elevators there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Moravec|Moravec, Hans]] (1978).

==History==

===Early concepts===
[[Image:Tsiolkovsky.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]]]
The key concept of the space elevator appeared in 1895 when [[Russia]]n scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] was inspired by the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. He considered a similar tower that reached all the way into space and was built from the ground up to the altitude of 35,786 kilometers, the height of [[geostationary orbit]].&lt;ref name="NASASci"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm |title=The Audacious Space Elevator |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=NASA Science News |dead-url=yes |accessdate=September 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919070924/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm |archivedate=September 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the top of such a tower would be circling [[Earth]] as in a geostationary orbit. Objects would attain horizontal velocity as they rode up the tower, and an object released at the tower's top would have enough horizontal velocity to remain there in geostationary orbit. Tsiolkovsky's conceptual tower was a compression structure, while modern concepts call for a [[tensile structure]] (or "tether").

===20th century===
Building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions.&lt;ref name="JBIS1999"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 another Russian scientist, [[Yuri N. Artsutanov]], suggested a more feasible proposal. Artsutanov suggested using a geostationary [[satellite]] as the base from which to deploy the structure downward. By using a [[counterweight]], a cable would be lowered from geostationary orbit to the surface of Earth, while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the cable constantly over the same spot on the surface of the Earth. Artsutanov's idea was introduced to the Russian-speaking public in an interview published in the Sunday supplement of ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in 1960,&lt;ref name="artsutanov"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://liftport.com/files/Artsutanov_Pravda_SE.pdf

Both the tower and cable ideas were proposed in the quasi-humorous [[Daedalus (Ariadne)|''Ariadne'' column]] in ''[[New Scientist]]'', December 24, 1964.

In 1966, Isaacs, Vine, Bradner and Bachus, four [[United States|American]] engineers, reinvented the concept, naming it a "Sky-Hook", and published their analysis in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to determine what type of material would be required to build a space elevator, assuming it would be a straight cable with no variations in its cross section, and found that the [[specific strength|strength]] required would be twice that of any then-existing material including [[graphite]], [[quartz]], and [[diamond]].

In 1975 an American scientist, [[Jerome Pearson]], reinvented the concept yet again, publishing his analysis in the journal ''[[Acta Astronautica]]''. He designed&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator. The completed cable would be thickest at the geostationary orbit, where the tension was greatest, and would be narrowest at the tips to reduce the amount of weight per unit area of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear. He suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to {{convert|144,000|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}, almost half the distance to the [[Moon]] as the lower section of the elevator was built. Without a large counterweight, the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way [[gravity|gravitational]] and centrifugal forces change with distance from Earth. His analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the Moon, wind and moving payloads up and down the cable. The weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of [[Space Shuttle]] trips, although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from [[Asteroid mining|asteroidal]] or [[In-situ resource utilization|lunar ore]].

After the development of [[carbon nanotubes]] in the 1990s, engineer David Smitherman of [[NASA]]/Marshall's Advanced Projects Office realized that the high strength of these materials might make the concept of a space elevator feasible, and put together a workshop at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], inviting many scientists and engineers to discuss concepts and compile plans for an elevator to turn the concept into a reality.

In 2000, another American scientist, [[Bradley C. Edwards]], suggested creating a {{convert|100,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long paper-thin ribbon using a carbon nanotube composite material.&lt;ref name=EDWARDS_PHASE_I_2000_472Edwards.html&gt;Bradley C. Edwards, "[http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/472Edwards.html The Space Elevator]"&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape rather than earlier circular cross-section concepts because that shape would stand a greater chance of surviving impacts by meteoroids. The ribbon cross-section shape also provided large surface area for climbers to climb with simple rollers. Supported by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]], Edwards' work was expanded to cover the deployment scenario, climber design, power delivery system, [[Space debris|orbital debris]] avoidance, anchor system, surviving [[atomic oxygen]], avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial Pacific, construction costs, construction schedule, and environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spaceelevator/2000-SpaceElevator-NASA-CP210429.pdf "Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium"], NASA/CP-2000-210429, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Science @ NASA, [https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm "Audacious &amp; Outrageous: Space Elevators"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919070924/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm |date=September 19, 2008 }}, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium | url = http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/spaceelevator.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221162221/http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/spaceelevator.html| archivedate = February 21, 2007|work=affordablespaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, "the [[LiftPort Group]] of space elevator companies announced that it will be building a carbon nanotube manufacturing plant in [[Millville, New Jersey]], to supply various glass, plastic and metal companies with these strong materials. Although LiftPort hopes to eventually use carbon nanotubes in the construction of a {{convert|100,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} space elevator, this move will allow it to make money in the short term and conduct research and development into new production methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, the International Academy of Astronautics published a technological feasibility assessment which concluded that the critical capability improvement needed was the tether material, which was projected to achieve the necessary strength-to-weight ratio within 20 years. The four-year long study looked into many facets of space elevator development including missions, development schedules, financial investments, revenue flow, and benefits. It was reported that it would be possible to operationally survive smaller impacts and avoid larger impacts, with meteors and space debris, and that the estimated cost of lifting a kilogram of payload to GEO and beyond would be $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Space Elevators: An Assessment of the Technological Feasibility and the Way Forward|last1 = Swan|last2 =Raitt|last3 =Swan|last4 = Penny|last5 =Knapman|first1 = Peter A.|first2 = David I.|first3 =  Cathy W.|first4 = Robert E.|first5 = John M.|publisher = International Academy of Astronautics|year = 2013|isbn = 9782917761311|location = Virginia, US|pages = 10–11, 207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In fiction==
{{main|Space elevators in fiction}}
In 1979, space elevators were introduced to a broader audience with the simultaneous publication of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel, ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'', in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of ''Taprobane'' (loosely based on [[Sri Lanka]], albeit moved south to the Equator), and [[Charles Sheffield]]'s first novel, ''[[The Web Between the Worlds]]'', also featuring the building of a space elevator. Three years later, in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1982 novel ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]'' the principal character makes use of the "Nairobi Beanstalk" in the course of her travels. In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Red Mars]]'', colonists build a space elevator on Mars that allows both for more colonists to arrive and also for natural resources mined there to be able to leave for Earth. In [[David Gerrold]]'s 2000 novel, ''[[Jumping Off The Planet]]'', a family excursion up the Ecuador "beanstalk" is actually a child-custody kidnapping. Gerrold's book also examines some of the industrial applications of a mature elevator technology. In a biological version, [[Joan Slonczewski]]'s 2011 novel ''The Highest Frontier'' depicts a college student ascending a space elevator constructed of self-healing cables of anthrax bacilli. The engineered bacteria can regrow the cables when severed by space debris.

==Physics==

===Apparent gravitational field===
A space elevator cable rotates along with the rotation of the Earth. Therefore, objects attached to the cable would experience upward centrifugal force in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward centrifugal force due to the rotation, so that more centrifugal force opposes less gravity. The centrifugal force and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). Above GEO, the centrifugal force is stronger than gravity, causing objects attached to the cable there to pull ''upward'' on it.

The net force for objects attached to the cable is called the ''apparent gravitational field''.  The apparent gravitational field for attached objects is the (downward) gravity minus the (upward) centrifugal force. The apparent gravity experienced by an object on the cable is zero at GEO, downward below GEO, and upward above GEO.

The apparent gravitational field can be represented this way:{{rp | Ref&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt; Table 1}}

{{block indent|The downward force of actual [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravity]] ''decreases'' with height:  [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|&lt;math&gt;g_r = -GM/r^2&lt;/math&gt;]]}}
{{block indent|The upward [[centrifugal force]] due to the planet's rotation ''increases'' with height: [[Centrifugal force|&lt;math&gt;a = \omega^2 r&lt;/math&gt;]]}}
{{block indent|Together, the apparent gravitational field is the sum of the two:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;g = -\frac{GM}{r^2} + \omega^2 r&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

where
{{block indent|''g'' is the acceleration of ''apparent'' gravity, pointing down (negative) or up (positive) along the vertical cable (m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),}}
{{block indent|''g&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gravitational acceleration due to Earth's pull, pointing down (negative)(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),}}
{{block indent|''a'' is the centrifugal acceleration, pointing up (positive) along the vertical cable (m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),}}
{{block indent|''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}
{{block indent|''M'' is the mass of the Earth (kg)}}
{{block indent|''r'' is the distance from that point to Earth's center (m),}}
{{block indent|''ω'' is Earth's rotation speed (radian/s).}}

At some point up the cable, the two terms (downward gravity and upward centrifugal force) are equal and opposite. Objects fixed to the cable at that point put no weight on the cable. This altitude (r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) depends on the mass of the planet and its rotation rate. Setting actual gravity equal to centrifugal acceleration gives:{{rp | Ref&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt; page 126}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \left(\frac{GM}{\omega^2}\right)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;}}

On Earth, this distance is {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the surface, the altitude of geostationary orbit.{{rp | Ref&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt; Table 1}}

On the cable ''below'' geostationary orbit, downward gravity would be greater than the upward centrifugal force, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable downward.  Any object released from the cable below that level would initially accelerate downward along the cable.  Then gradually it would deflect eastward from the cable.  On the cable ''above'' the level of stationary orbit, upward centrifugal force would be greater than downward gravity, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable ''upward''.  Any object released from the cable ''above'' the geosynchronous level would initially accelerate ''upward'' along the cable.  Then gradually it would deflect westward from the cable.

===Cable section===
Historically, the main technical problem has been considered the ability of the cable to hold up, with tension, the weight of itself below any given point. The greatest tension on a space elevator cable is at the point of geostationary orbit, {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the Earth's equator. This means that the cable material, combined with its design, must be strong enough to hold up its own weight from the surface up to {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. A cable which is thicker in cross section at that height than at the surface could better hold up its own weight over a longer length. How the cross section area tapers from the maximum at {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the minimum at the surface is therefore an important design factor for a space elevator cable.

To maximize the usable excess strength for a given amount of cable material, the cable's cross section area would need to be designed for the most part in such a way that the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] (i.e., the tension per unit of cross sectional area) is constant along the length of the cable.&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artuković, Ranko (2000). [http://www.zadar.net/space-elevator/ "The Space Elevator".] zadar.net&lt;/ref&gt;  The constant-stress criterion is a starting point in the design of the cable cross section as it changes with altitude. Other factors considered in more detailed designs include thickening at altitudes where more space junk is present, consideration of the point stresses imposed by climbers, and the use of varied materials.&lt;ref name=PhaseII/&gt;  To account for these and other factors, modern detailed cross section designs seek to achieve the largest ''[[Factor of safety#Margin of safety|safety margin]]'' possible, with as little variation over altitude and time as possible.&lt;ref name=PhaseII/&gt;  In simple starting-point designs, that equates to constant-stress.

In the constant-stress case, the cross-section follows this differential equation:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sigma dS = g \rho S dr&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt;}}

or
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{S} = \frac{g\rho}{\sigma} dr&lt;/math&gt;}}

or
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{S} = \frac{\rho}{\sigma} \left(\frac{GM}{r^2} - \omega^2 r \right)dr&lt;/math&gt;{{rp | Ref&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt; equation 6}}}}

where
{{block indent|''g'' is the acceleration along the radius (m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),}}
{{block indent|''S'' is the cross-section area of the cable at any given point r, (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and dS its variation (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  as well),}}
{{block indent|''ρ'' is the density of the material used for the cable (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).}}
{{block indent|1=''σ'' is the stress the cross-section area can bear without [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;=kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), its elastic limit.}}

The value of ''g'' is given by the first equation, which yields:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left[\ln (S)\right]_{r_0}^{r_1} = -\frac{\rho}{\sigma} \Delta\left[ \frac{GM}{r} + \frac{\omega^2 r^2}{2} \right]_{r_0}^{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;,}}
the variation being taken between ''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (ground) and  ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (geostationary).&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt;

Between these two points, this quantity can be expressed as:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left[\ln (S)\right] = \frac{\rho}{\sigma} g_0 r_0 \left( 1 + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{3}{2} x^\frac{1}{3}\right),&lt;/math&gt;}}

or
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;S_1 = S_0.e^{\frac{\rho}{\sigma} g_0 r_0 \left( 1 + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{3}{2} x^\frac{1}{3}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;{{rp | Ref&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt; equation 7}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;x = \omega^2 r_0/g_0 \thicksim 0.0035&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio between the centrifugal force on the equator and the gravitational force.&lt;ref name="aravind"/&gt;

===Cable material===
{{Original research section|small=yes|date=October 2012}}
To compare materials, the ''[[specific strength]]'' of the material for the space elevator can be expressed in terms of the ''characteristic length'', or "free breaking length": the length of an un-tapered cylindrical cable at which it will break under its own weight under constant gravity. For a given material, that length is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;L_c = \sigma/(\rho g_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; are as defined above.

The free breaking length needed is given by the equation
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left[ \ln (S)\right] = \frac{r_0}{L_0} \left(1 + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{3}{2} x^\frac{1}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

For a space elevator with a material with &lt;math&gt;L_c = r_0\thicksim6377 km&lt;/math&gt;, the section at the synchronous orbit needs to be ''[[E (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e^{\left(1 + x/2 - 3x^{1/3}/2\right)}\thicksim 2.2&lt;/math&gt;]]'' times as much as at ground level. For a space elevator with a material with &lt;math&gt;L_c = r_0/10\thicksim638 km&lt;/math&gt;, the section at the synchronous orbit needs to be ''[[E (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e^{10\left(1 + x/2 - 3x^{1/3}/2\right)}\thicksim 2441&lt;/math&gt;]]'' times as much as at ground level.

==Structure==
[[Image:SpaceElevatorClimbing.jpg|thumb|right|One concept for the space elevator has it tethered to a mobile seagoing platform.]]
There are a variety of space elevator designs. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a counterweight. Earth's rotation creates upward [[centrifugal force]]&lt;!--"upward" is a continuously changing direction which implies an accelerated reference frame where "c.f." is unquestionable (see http://xkcd.com/123/)  --&gt; on the counterweight. The counterweight is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the counterweight. The base station anchors the whole system to the surface of the Earth. Climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo.

===Base station===
Modern concepts for the base station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations would have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and [[space debris]]. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in [[international waters]], simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;

Stationary land based platforms would have simpler and less costly logistical access to the base. They also would have an advantage of being able to be at high altitude, such as on top of mountains.  In an alternate concept, the base station could be a tower, forming a space elevator which comprises both a compression tower close to the surface, and a tether structure at higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="JBIS1999"/&gt; Combining a compression structure with a tension structure would reduce loads from the atmosphere at the Earth end of the tether, and reduce the distance into the Earth's gravity field the cable needs to extend, and thus reduce the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material, all other design factors being equal.

===Cable===
[[File:Kohlenstoffnanoroehre Animation.gif|thumb|upright|[[Carbon nanotubes]] are one of the candidates for a cable material]]
[[Image:SpaceElevatorAnchor.jpg|thumb|upright|A seagoing anchor station would also act as a deep-water [[seaport]].]]
A space elevator cable would need to carry its own weight as well as the additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable would vary along its length. This is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a space elevator cable would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor – the ratio between the cable's radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=NASA97029&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/assets/pdf/techreports/1997/nas-97-029.pdf

|accessdate=September 27, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable would need to be made of a material with a large [[specific strength|tensile strength/density ratio]]. For example, the Edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a specific strength of at least 100,000&amp;nbsp;kN/(kg/m).&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of {{convert|4,960|km|mi|sp=us}} of its own weight ''at [[sea level]]'' to reach a [[geostationary]] altitude of {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} without yielding.&lt;ref&gt;This 4,960 km "escape length" (calculated by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in 1979) is much shorter than the actual distance spanned because [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]]s increase (and gravity decreases) dramatically with height: {{cite web|url= http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/CLARK2.HTM|title = The space elevator: 'thought experiment', or key to the universe?''|last = Clarke|first = A.C.|year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a material with very high strength and lightness is needed.

For comparison, metals like titanium, steel or aluminium alloys have [[specific strength|breaking lengths]] of only 20–30&amp;nbsp;km. Modern [[Man-made fibers|fibre]] materials such as [[kevlar]], [[fibreglass]] and [[Carbon fiber|carbon/graphite fibre]] have breaking lengths of 100–400&amp;nbsp;km. Nanoengineered materials such as [[carbon nanotubes]] and, more recently discovered, [[graphene]] ribbons (perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon) are expected to have breaking lengths of 5000–6000&amp;nbsp;km at sea level, and also are able to conduct electrical power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

For a space elevator on Earth, with its comparatively high gravity, the cable material would need to be stronger and lighter than currently available materials.&lt;ref name="Huff.3353697" /&gt; For this reason, there has been a focus on the development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement. For high specific strength, carbon has advantages because it is only the 6th element in the [[periodic table]]. Carbon has comparatively few of the [[nucleons|protons and neutrons]] which contribute most of the dead weight of any material. Most of the interatomic [[Chemical bond|bonding forces]] of any element are contributed by only the [[Valence electron|outer few]] electrons. For carbon, the strength and stability of those bonds is high compared to the mass of the atom. The challenge in using carbon nanotubes remains to extend to macroscopic sizes the production of such material that are still perfect on the microscopic scale (as microscopic [[Crystallographic defects|defects]] are most responsible for material weakness).&lt;ref name="Huff.3353697"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jillian |last=Scharr |title=Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say |work=Huffington Post |date=29 May 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbers===
[[Image:SpaceElevatorInClouds.jpg|thumb|upright|A conceptual drawing of a space elevator climber ascending through the clouds.]]

A space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips. While various designs employing moving cables have been proposed, most cable designs call for the "elevator" to climb up a stationary cable.

Climbers cover a wide range of designs. On elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons, most propose to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction.

Climbers would need to be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput. Lighter climbers could be sent up more often, with several going up at the same time. This would increase throughput somewhat, but would lower the mass of each individual payload.&lt;ref name="LangGTOSS" &gt;Lang, David D. [http://spaceelevatorwiki.com/wiki/images/2/2b/Paper_Lang_Climber_Transit.pdf Space Elevator Dynamic Response to In-Transit Climbers].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space elevator balance of forces--circular Earth--more accurate force vectors.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|As the car climbs, the cable takes on a slight lean due to the Coriolis force.  The top of the cable travels faster than the bottom.  The climber is accelerated horizontally as it ascends by the Coriolis force which is imparted by angles of the cable.  The lean-angle shown is exaggerated.]]
The horizontal speed, i.e. due to orbital rotation, of each part of the cable increases with altitude, proportional to distance from the center of the Earth, reaching low [[orbital speed]] at a point approximately 66 percent of the height between the surface and geostationary orbit, or a height of about 23,400&amp;nbsp;km. A payload released at this point would go into a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, staying just barely clear from atmospheric reentry, with the [[periapsis]] at the same altitude as LEO and the [[apoapsis]] at the release height. With increasing release height the orbit would become less eccentric as both periapsis and apoapsis increase, becoming circular at geostationary level.&lt;ref name="Gassend_fall"&gt;

When the payload has reached GEO, the horizontal speed is exactly the speed of a circular orbit at that level, so that if released, it would remain adjacent to that point on the cable.  The payload can also continue climbing further up the cable beyond GEO, allowing it to obtain higher speed at jettison.  If released from 100,000&amp;nbsp;km, the payload would have enough speed to reach the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=PhaseII /&gt;

As a payload is lifted up a space elevator, it would gain not only altitude, but horizontal speed (angular momentum) as well. The angular momentum is taken from the Earth's rotation. As the climber ascends, it is initially moving slower than each successive part of cable it is moving on to. This is the [[Coriolis force]]: the climber "drags" (westward) on the cable, as it climbs, and slightly decreases the Earth's rotation speed. The opposite process would occur for descending payloads: the cable is tilted eastward, thus slightly increasing Earth's rotation speed.

The overall effect of the &lt;!--n.b. the elevator is in a non inertial reference frame, so centrifugal is correct---&gt;centrifugal force acting on the cable would cause it to constantly try to return to the energetically favorable vertical orientation, so after an object has been lifted on the cable, the counterweight would swing back toward the vertical like an inverted pendulum.&lt;ref name="LangGTOSS"/&gt; Space elevators and their loads would be designed so that the center of mass is always well-enough above the level of geostationary orbit&lt;ref&gt;[http://gassend.net/spaceelevator/center-of-mass/index.html "Why the Space Elevator's Center of Mass is not at GEO" by Blaise Gassend]. Gassend.net. Retrieved on September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to hold up the whole system. Lift and descent operations would need to be carefully planned so as to keep the pendulum-like motion of the counterweight around the tether point under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.10.003|title=The effect of climber transit on the space elevator dynamics|year=2009|last1=Cohen|first1=Stephen S.|last2=Misra|first2=Arun K.|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=64|issue=5–6|pages=538–553|bibcode=2009AcAau..64..538C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climber speed would be limited by the Coriolis force, available power, and by the need to ensure the climber's accelerating force does not break the cable. Climbers would also need to maintain a minimum average speed in order to move material up and down economically and expeditiously.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} At the speed of a very fast car or train of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} it will take about 5 days to climb to geosynchronous orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bill Fawcett, Michael Laine  |author2=Tom Nugent jr. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=LIFTPORT|date=2006|publisher=Meisha Merlin Publishing, Inc.|location=Canada|isbn=1-59222-109-2|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powering climbers===
Both power and energy are significant issues for climbers—the climbers would need to gain a large amount of potential energy as quickly as possible to clear the cable for the next payload.

Various methods have been proposed to get that energy to the climber:
* Transfer the energy to the climber through [[wireless energy transfer]] while it is climbing.
* Transfer the energy to the climber through some material structure while it is climbing.
* Store the energy in the climber before it starts – requires an extremely high [[specific energy]] such as nuclear energy.
* Solar power – After the first 40&amp;nbsp;km it is possible to use solar energy to power the climber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Wireless energy transfer such as laser power beaming is currently considered the most likely method, using megawatt powered free electron or solid state lasers in combination with adaptive mirrors approximately {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and a photovoltaic array on the climber tuned to the laser frequency for efficiency.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; For climber designs powered by power beaming, this efficiency is an important design goal. Unused energy would need to be re-radiated away with heat-dissipation systems, which add to weight.

Yoshio Aoki, a professor of precision machinery engineering at [[Nihon University]] and director of the Japan Space Elevator Association, suggested including a second cable and using the conductivity of carbon nanotubes to provide power.&lt;ref name=JapanUKTimes/&gt;

===Counterweight===
[[File:Nasa space elev.jpg|thumb|Space Elevator with Space Station]]
Several solutions have been proposed to act as a counterweight:
*a heavy, captured [[asteroid]];&lt;ref name=NASASci/&gt;
*a [[space dock]], [[space station]] or [[spaceport]] positioned past geostationary orbit
*a further upward extension of the cable itself so that the net upward pull would be the same as an equivalent counterweight;
*parked spent climbers that had been used to thicken the cable during construction, other junk, and material lifted up the cable for the purpose of increasing the counterweight.&lt;ref name=PhaseII &gt;Edwards BC, Westling EA. (2002) ''The Space Elevator: A Revolutionary Earth-to-Space Transportation System.'' San Francisco, USA: Spageo Inc. {{ISBN|0-9726045-0-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Extending the cable has the advantage of some simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the Earth, allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space. Its disadvantage is the need to produce greater amounts of cable material as opposed to using just anything available that has mass.

==Launching into deep space==
An object attached to a space elevator at a radius of approximately 53,100&amp;nbsp;km would be at [[escape velocity]] when released. Transfer orbits to the L1 and L2 [[Lagrangian point]]s could be attained by release at 50,630 and 51,240&amp;nbsp;km, respectively, and transfer to lunar orbit from 50,960&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceelevator.com/docs/iac-2004/iac-04-iaa.3.8.3.04.engel.pdf |title=IAC-04-IAA.3.8.3.04 Lunar transportation scenarios utilising the space elevator |author=Engel, Kilian A. |publisher=www.spaceelevator.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424230830/http://www.spaceelevator.com/docs/iac-2004/iac-04-iaa.3.8.3.04.engel.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of Pearson's {{convert|144,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} cable, the tangential velocity is 10.93 kilometers per second (6.79&amp;nbsp;mi/s). That is more than enough to [[escape velocity|escape]] Earth's gravitational field and send probes at least as far out as  [[Jupiter]]. Once at Jupiter, a [[gravitational assist]] maneuver could permit solar escape velocity to be reached.&lt;ref name="aravind"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The physics of the space elevator|author=Aravind, P.

==Extraterrestrial elevators==
A space elevator could also be constructed on other planets, asteroids and moons.

A [[Mars|Martian]] tether could be much shorter than one on Earth. Mars' surface gravity is 38 percent of Earth's, while it rotates around its axis in about the same time as Earth. Because of this, Martian [[areostationary orbit|stationary orbit]] is much closer to the surface, and hence the elevator could be much shorter. Current materials are already sufficiently strong to construct such an elevator.&lt;ref&gt;Forward, Robert L. and Moravec, Hans P. (March 22, 1980) [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/1982.articles/elevate.800322 Space Elevators]. Carnegie Mellon University. "Interestingly enough, they are already more than strong enough for constructing skyhooks on the moon and Mars."&lt;/ref&gt; Building a Martian elevator would be complicated by the Martian moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], which is in a low orbit and intersects the Equator regularly (twice every orbital period of 11&amp;nbsp;h 6&amp;nbsp;min).

On the near side of the Moon, the strength-to-density required of the tether of a [[lunar space elevator]] exists in currently available materials. A lunar space elevator would be about {{convert|50,000|km|mi|sp=us}} long. Since the Moon does not rotate fast enough, there is no effective lunar-stationary orbit, but the [[Lagrangian point]]s could be used. The near side would extend through the Earth-Moon [[Inner lagrangian point|L1]] point from an anchor point near the center of the visible part of Earth's Moon.&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005"/&gt;

On the far side of the Moon, a lunar space elevator would need to be very long—more than twice the length of an Earth elevator—but due to the low gravity of the Moon, could also be made of existing engineering materials.&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| year= 2005| title=Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development Phase I Final Technical Report| last1=pearson |first1=Jerome| first2=Eugene |last2=Levin |first3=John |last3=Oldson |first4=Harry |last4=Wykes| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapidly spinning asteroids or moons could use cables to eject materials to convenient points, such as Earth orbits;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shelef, the Spaceward Foundation [http://www.spaceward.org/documents/papers/ASE.pdf Asteroid Slingshot Express - Tether-based Sample Return]&lt;/ref&gt; or conversely, to eject materials to send a portion of the mass of the asteroid or moon to Earth orbit or a [[Lagrangian point]]. [[Freeman Dyson]], a physicist and mathematician, has suggested{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} using such smaller systems as power generators at points distant from the Sun where solar power is uneconomical.

A space elevator using presently available engineering materials could be constructed between mutually tidally locked worlds, such as [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] or the components of binary asteroid [[90 Antiope]], with no terminus disconnect, according to Francis Graham of Kent State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Graham FG |title=45th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference &amp; Exhibit|doi=10.2514/6.2009-4906|chapter=Preliminary Design of a Cable Spacecraft Connecting Mutually Tidally Locked Planetary Bodies|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60086-972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, spooled variable lengths of cable must be used due to ellipticity of the orbits.

==Construction==
{{Main article|Space elevator construction}}

The construction of a space elevator would need reduction of some technical risk. Some advances in engineering, manufacturing and physical technology are required.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; Once a first space elevator is built, the second one and all others would have the use of the previous ones to assist in construction, making their costs considerably lower. Such follow-on space elevators would also benefit from the great reduction in technical risk achieved by the construction of the first space elevator.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;

Prior to the work of Edwards in 2000&lt;ref name=EDWARDS_PHASE_I_2000_472Edwards.html /&gt; most concepts for constructing a space elevator had the cable manufactured in space.  That was thought to be necessary for such a large and long object and for such a large counterweight.  Manufacturing the cable in space would be done in principle by using an [[asteroid]] or [[Near-Earth object]] for source material.&lt;ref name=SMITHERMAN&gt;D.V. Smitherman (Ed.), [http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spaceelevator/2000-SpaceElevator-NASA-CP210429.pdf Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium], NASA/CP-2000-210429, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hein, A.M., [https://www.academia.edu/2111184/A.M._Hein_Producing_a_Space_Elevator_Tether_using_a_NEO_A_Preliminary_Assessment_ Producing a Space Elevator Tether Using a NEO: A Preliminary Assessment], International Astronautical Congress 2012, IAC-2012, Naples, Italy, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These earlier concepts for construction require a large preexisting space-faring infrastructure to maneuver an asteroid into its needed orbit around Earth.  They also required the development of technologies for manufacture in space of large quantities of exacting materials.&lt;ref name=ISEC_SE_way_forward_2013&gt;Space Elevators: An Assessment of the Technological Feasibility and the Way Forward, Page 326, http://www.virginiaedition.com/media/spaceelevators.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, most work has focused on simpler methods of construction requiring much smaller space infrastructures.  They conceive the launch of a long cable on a large spool, followed by deployment of it in space.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDWARDS_PHASE_I_2000_472Edwards.html /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISEC_SE_way_forward_2013 /&gt;  The spool would be initially parked in a geostationary orbit above the planned anchor point. A long cable would be dropped "downward" (toward Earth) and would be balanced by a mass being dropped "upward" (away from Earth) for the whole system to remain on the geosynchronous orbit. Earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable (with counterweight) extending upward, with the main spool remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level. Most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is paid out, a simpler process. When the lower end of the cable is long enough to reach the surface of the Earth (at the equator), it would be anchored. Once anchored, the center of mass would be elevated more (by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable). This would add more tension to the whole cable, which could then be used as an elevator cable.

One plan for construction uses conventional rockets to place a "minimum size" initial seed cable of only 19,800&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; This first very small ribbon would be adequate to support the first 619&amp;nbsp;kg climber. The first 207 climbers would carry up and attach more cable to the original, increasing its cross section area and widening the initial ribbon to about 160&amp;nbsp;mm wide at its widest point. The result would be a 750-ton cable with a lift capacity of 20 tons per climber.

===Safety issues and construction challenges===
{{Main article|Space elevator safety}}
For early systems, transit times from the surface to the level of geosynchronous orbit would be about five days. On these early systems, the time spent moving through the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] would be enough that passengers would need to be protected from radiation by shielding, which would add mass to the climber and decrease payload.&lt;ref name=firstfloor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10520 |title=Space elevators: 'First floor, deadly radiation!' |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |date=November 13, 2006|work=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A space elevator would present a navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be diverted by [[air-traffic control]] restrictions. All objects in stable orbits that have [[perigee]] below the maximum altitude of the cable that are not synchronous with the cable would impact the cable eventually, unless avoiding action is taken. One potential solution proposed by Edwards is to use a movable anchor (a sea anchor) to allow the tether to "dodge" any space debris large enough to track.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;

Impacts by space objects such as meteoroids, micrometeorites and orbiting man-made debris pose another design constraint on the cable. A cable would need to be designed to maneuver out of the way of debris, or absorb impacts of small debris without breaking.

===Economics===
{{Main article|Space elevator economics}}
With a space elevator, materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost. As of 2000, conventional rocket designs cost about US$25,000 per [[kilogram]] (US$11,000 per [[Pound (mass)|pound]]) for transfer to geostationary orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_f/futron_corporation/20021018_countdown.html |title=Delayed countdown |accessdate=June 3, 2009 |date=October 18, 2002|work=Fultron Corporation |publisher=The Information Company Pvt Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current space elevator proposals envision payload prices starting as low as $220 per kilogram ($100 per [[Pound (mass)|pound]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceward.org/elevator-faq |title=The Space Elevator FAQ |accessdate=June 3, 2009 |author=The Spaceward Foundation |location=Mountain View, CA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227115101/http://www.spaceward.org/elevator-faq |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the $5–$300/kg estimates of the [[Launch loop]], but higher than the $310/ton to 500&amp;nbsp;km orbit quoted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerrypournelle.com/archives2/archives2view/view306.html#Friday |title=Friday's VIEW post from the 2004 Space Access Conference |date=April 23, 2003| accessdate=January 1, 2010 |first=Jerry|last=Pournelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Dr. [[Jerry Pournelle]] for an orbital airship system.

==Related concepts==
The conventional current concept of a "Space Elevator" has evolved from a static compressive structure reaching to the level of GEO, to the modern baseline idea of a static tensile structure anchored to the ground and extending to well above the level of GEO. In the current usage by practitioners (and in this article), a "Space Elevator" means the Tsiolkovsky-Artsutanov-Pearson type as considered by the International Space Elevator Consortium. This conventional type is a static structure fixed to the ground and extending into space high enough that cargo can climb the structure up from the ground to a level where simple release will put the cargo into an [[orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;"CLIMB: The Journal of the International Space Elevator Consortium", Volume 1, Number 1, December 2011, This journal is cited as an example of what is generally considered to be under the term "Space Elevator" by the international community. [http://www.isec.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some concepts related to this modern baseline are not usually termed a "Space Elevator", but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed "Space Elevator" by their proponents. For example, [[Hans Moravec]] published an article in 1977 called "A Non-Synchronous Orbital [[Skyhook (structure)|Skyhook]]" describing a concept using a rotating cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moravec, Hans P. |title=A Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhook|journal=Journal of the Astronautical Sciences|volume=25|date= October–December 1977|bibcode=1977JAnSc..25..307M|pages=307–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed in such a way that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be "elevated". It would dynamically grapple and then "elevate" high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit.

The original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure, a concept similar to an [[Radio masts and towers|aerial mast]]. While such structures might reach [[Karman line|space]] (100&amp;nbsp;km, 62&amp;nbsp;mi), they are unlikely to reach geostationary orbit. The concept of a Tsiolkovsky tower combined with a classic space elevator cable (reaching above the level of GEO) has been suggested.&lt;ref name="JBIS1999"/&gt;  Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles.&lt;ref name=TorontoProposal /&gt;  The vehicle is "elevated" up the tower, which may extend as high as [[Karman line|above the atmosphere]], and is launched from the top.  Such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been proposed by various researchers.&lt;ref name=TorontoProposal&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.02.018|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/dspace/bitstream/handle/10315/2587/AA_3369_Quine_Space_Elevator_Final_2009.pdf|bibcode=2009AcAau..65..365Q|title=A free-standing space elevator structure: A practical alternative to the space tether|year=2009|last1=Quine|first1=B.M.|last2=Seth|first2=R.K.|last3=Zhu|first3=Z.H.|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=65|issue=3–4|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landis1996"&gt;Landis, Geoffrey, "Compression Structures for Earth Launch," 7th Advanced Space Propulsion Workshop, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, April 9–11, 1996; also [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1998-3737 paper AIAA-98-3737], 24th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjelmstad, Keith, [http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hjelmstad-on-Stephenson-Structural-Design-of-the-Tall-Tower.pdf "Structural Design of the Tall Tower"], ''Hieroglyph'', 11/30/2013.

[[Image:Stanford torus external view by Don Davis AC76-0525.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior view of a Stanford torus. Bottom center is the non-rotating primary solar mirror, which reflects sunlight onto the angled ring of secondary mirrors around the hub. Painting by Donald E. Davis]]
[[Image:Stanford Torus interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a Stanford torus, painted by Donald E. Davis]]

The '''Stanford torus''' is a proposed [[NASA]] design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Table_of_Contents1.html| title=Space Settlements: A Design Study|year=1977| author=Johnson, Holbrow|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[space habitat]] capable of housing 10,000 to 140,000 permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, pg 1, "The Overall System", pg 60, Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stanford torus was proposed during the 1975 NASA Summer Study, conducted at [[Stanford University]], with the purpose of exploring and speculating on designs for future [[space colonization|space colonies]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, pg VII, "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gerard O'Neill]] later proposed his [[Bernal sphere#Island One|Island One]] or [[Bernal sphere]] as an alternative to the torus&lt;ref&gt;Gerard K. O'Neil, "The High Frontier", William Morrow &amp; Co., 1977, p149&lt;/ref&gt;). "Stanford torus" refers only to this particular version of the design, as the concept of a [[Rotating wheel space station|ring-shaped rotating space station]] was previously proposed by [[Wernher von Braun]]&lt;ref&gt;Von Braun, W.:Crossing the Final Frontier, Colliers, March 22, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Potočnik]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Potočnik: The Problem of Space Travel (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a [[torus]], or [[doughnut]]-shaped ring, that is 1.8&amp;nbsp;km in diameter (for the proposed 10,000 person habitat described in the 1975 Summer Study) and rotates once per minute to provide between 0.9g and 1.0g of [[artificial gravity]] on the inside of the outer ring via [[centrifugal force]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, NASA study, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight is provided to the interior of the torus by a system of [[mirror]]s, including a large non-rotating primary solar mirror.

The ring is connected to a hub via a number of "spokes", which serve as conduits for people and materials travelling to and from the hub. Since the hub is at the rotational axis of the station, it experiences the least artificial gravity and is the easiest location for [[spacecraft]] to dock. [[Space manufacturing|Zero-gravity industry]] is performed in a non-rotating module attached to the hub's axis.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, Chap. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior space of the torus itself is used as living space, and is large enough that a "natural" environment can be simulated; the torus appears similar to a long, narrow, straight [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]] whose ends curve upward and eventually meet overhead to form a complete circle. The population density is similar to a dense suburb, with part of the ring dedicated to agriculture and part to housing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, Chap. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The torus would require nearly 10 million tons of mass. Construction would use materials extracted from the [[Moon]] and sent to space using a [[mass driver]]. A mass catcher at [[Lagrangian point#L2|L2]] would collect the materials, transporting them to [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L5]] where they could be processed in an industrial facility to construct the torus. Only materials that could not be obtained from the Moon would have to be imported from Earth. [[Asteroid mining]] was an alternative source of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770014162_1977014162.pdf | title=Space Settlements: A Design Study | publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server | year=1977 | accessdate=October 20, 2012 |author1=Johnson, Richard D. |author2=Holbrow, Charles | pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==

{{Capitalism}}
'''Technocapitalism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "[[technology]]" and "[[capitalism]]") refers to changes in capitalism associated with the emergence of new technology sectors, the power of [[corporation]]s, and new forms of organization.

==Corporate power and organization==
Luis Suarez-Villa, in his 2009 book ''Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism'' argues that it is a new version of capitalism that generates new forms of [[corporation|corporate organization]] designed to exploit ''intangibles'' such as [[creativity]] and new [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Suarez-Villa, ''Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The new organizations, which he refers to as ''experimentalist organizations'' are deeply grounded in technological research, as opposed to manufacturing and services production.  They are also heavily dependent on the corporate appropriation of research outcomes as [[intellectual property]].

This approach is further developed by Suarez-Villa in his 2012 book ''Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination'', in which he relates the emergence of technocapitalism to [[globalization]] and to the growing power of technocapitalist [[corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Suarez-Villa, ''Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination'' (London: Ashgate, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking into account the new relations of power introduced by the corporations that control technocapitalism, he considers new forms of accumulation involving intangibles—such as [[creativity]] and new [[knowledge]]—along with [[intellectual property]] and technological infrastructure.  This perspective on [[globalization]]—and the effect of technocapitalism and its corporations—also takes into account the growing global importance of intangibles, the inequalities created between nations at the vanguard of technocapitalism and those that are not, the increasing importance of [[brain-drain]] flows between nations, and the rise of what he refers to as a ''techno-military-corporate'' complex that is rapidly replacing the old [[military-industrial complex]] of the second half of the 20th century.  

The concept behind technocapitalism is part of a line of thought that relates [[science]] and [[technology]] to the evolution of [[capitalism]].  At the core of this idea of the evolution of capitalism is that science and technology are not divorced from society—or that they exist in a vacuum, or in a separate reality of their own—out of reach of social action and human decision.  Science and technology are part of society, and they are subject to the priorities of capitalism as much as any other human endeavor, if not more so.  Prominent scientists in the early 20th century, such as [[John Desmond Bernal|John Bernal]], posited that science has a social function, and cannot be seen as something apart from society.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Bernal, ''The Social Function of Science'' (New York: Macmillan, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scientists at that time, such as [[J. B. S. Haldane|John Haldane]], related science to social philosophy, and showed how critical approaches to social analysis are very relevant to science, and to our understanding of the need for science.&lt;ref&gt;John B. S. Haldane, ''Dialectical Materialism and Modern Science'' (London: Labour Monthly, 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;  In our time, this line of thought has encouraged philosophers such as [[Andrew Feenberg]] to adopt and apply a [[critical theory]] approach to technology and science, providing many important insights on how scientific and technological decisions—and their outcomes—are shaped by society, and by capitalism and its institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Feenberg, ''Critical Theory of Technology'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''technocapitalism'' has been used by one author to denote aspects and ideas that diverge sharply from those explained above. [[Dinesh D'Souza]], writing about [[Silicon Valley]] in an article, used the term to describe the corporate environment and [[venture capital]] relationships in a high tech-oriented local economy.  His approach to the topic was consonant with that of business journals and the corporate management literature.  Some newspaper articles have also used the term occasionally and in a very general sense, to denote the importance of advanced technologies in the economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|[[Everett Rogers|Rogers]]{{'}} [[normal distribution|bell curve]]]]
The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

'''User-centered design''' ('''UCD''') or '''user-driven development''' ('''UDD''') is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which [[usability]] goals, user characteristics, [[Environment (systems)|environment]], tasks and workflow of a [[product (business)|product]], service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the [[design process]]. User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product, but also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests. These tests are conducted with/without actual users during each stage of the process from [[requirement]]s, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that "development proceeds with the user as the center of focus." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/|title=Cover – Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design|website=uiaccess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="w3.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/ucd|title=Notes on User Centered Design Process (UCD)|website=www.w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such testing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Chisnell|first2=Dana|title=Handbook of Usability Testing: How to Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-08040-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_e1MmVzMb0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jeffrey+Rubin,+Handbook+of+Usability+Testing:+How+to+Plan,+Design,+and+Conduct+Effective+Tests,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBxcfY3YPTAhUJ7YMKHXMVBrAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jeffrey%20Rubin%2C%20Handbook%20of%20Usability%20Testing%3A%20How%20to%20Plan%2C%20Design%2C%20and%20Conduct%20Effective%20Tests%2C&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of a product to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design [[experience]]s, and what each user's [[learning curve]] may look like. User-centered design is common in the design industry and when used is considered to lead to increased product usefulness and usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/idc/ituniv/kurser/09/hcd/literatures/Vredenburg%202002.pdf|title=A Survey of User-Centered Design Practice|last=Vredenburg|first=Karel|last2=Mao|first2=Ji-Ye|date=|year=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Smith|first3=Paul|last4=Carey|first4=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief difference from other product design [[Philosophy|philosophies]] is that user-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product, rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product. The users thus stand in the center of two concentric circles. The inner circle includes the context of the product, objectives of developing it and the environment it would run in. The outer circle involves more granular details of task detail, task organization, and task flow.&lt;ref name="w3.org" /&gt;

== Needs and emotions ==
The term user-centered design was coined in [[Don Norman|Donald A. Norman's]] research laboratory in [[University of California, San Diego]]. The concept became widely popular after the publication of the book "User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction" in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D. A. (1986). User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept gained further attention and acceptance in his seminal book "[[The Design of Everyday Things]]" (originally called "The Psychology of Everyday Things"). In the book, Norman describes the psychology behind what he deems 'good' and 'bad' design through examples. He exalts the importance of design in our everyday lives, and the consequences of errors caused by bad designs. The books also include principles of building well-designed products. His recommendations are based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he considers secondary issues like aesthetics. The main highlights of these are:

# Simplifying the structure of the tasks such that the possible actions at any moment are intuitive.
# Make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, actions, results of actions and feedback.
# Getting the mappings right between intended results and required actions.
# Embracing and exploiting the constraints of systems

Norman's overly reductive approach in the previous texts was readdressed by him later in his own publication "[[Emotional Design]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/CH00_Prolog.pdf|title=Don Norman (2003) Emotional Design, Prolog-- Three Teapots|website=jnd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.5 onwards}}.

== Models and approaches ==

For example, the user-centered design process can help software designers to fulfill the goal of a product engineered for their users. User requirements are considered right from the beginning and included into the whole product cycle. These requirements are noted and refined through investigative methods including: ethnographic study, [[contextual inquiry]], prototype testing, [[usability testing]] and other methods. Generative methods may also be used including: card sorting, affinity diagramming and participatory design sessions. In addition, user requirements can be inferred by careful analysis of usable products similar to the product being designed.
* [[Cooperative design]]: involving designers and users on an equal footing. This is the Scandinavian tradition of design of IT artifacts and it has been evolving since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Greenbaum&amp;Kyng (eds): Design At Work – Cooperative design of Computer Systems, Lawrence Erlbaum 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Participatory design]] (PD), a North American term for the same concept, inspired by Cooperative Design, focusing on the participation of users. Since 1990, there has been a bi-annual Participatory Design Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Schuler&amp;Namioka: Participatory Design, Lawrence Erlbaum 1993 and chapter 11 in Helander's Handbook of HCI, Elsevier 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Contextual design]], "customer-centered design" in the actual context, including some ideas from Participatory design&lt;ref&gt;Beyer&amp;Holtzblatt, ''Contextual Design'', Kaufmann 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are principles that will ensure a design is user centered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User-Centered Design Basics|url=https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html|website=www.usability.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
# Users are involved throughout design and development.
# The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
# The process is iterative.
# The design addresses the whole user experience.
# The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

== User-Centered Design Process ==
The goal of the User-Centered design is to make products which have very high [[usability]]. This includes how convenient the product is in terms of its usage, manageability, effectiveness and how well the product is mapped to the user requirements. Below are the general phases of User-Centered Design process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on User Centered Design Process (UCD)|url=https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/ucd|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User-Centered Design Basics|url=https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html|website=www.usability.gov|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Specify context of use: Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it.
# Specify Requirements: Once the context is specified, it is the time to identify the granular requirements of the product. This is an important process which can further facilitate the designers to create storyboards, and set important goals to make the product successful.
# Create Design solutions and development: Based on product goals and requirements, start an [[Iterative design|iterative]] process of product design and development.
# Evaluate Product: Product designers do usability testing to get users' feedback of the product. Product evaluation is a crucial step in product development which gives critical feedback of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moen|first1=Ron|title=A Review of the IDEO Process|url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/web-assets/2001/10/a-review-of-the-ideo-process|website=www.rwjf.org|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the next steps, the above procedure is repeated to further finish the product. These phases are general approaches and factors like design goals, team and their timeline, and environment in which the product is developed, determine the appropriate phases for a project and their order. You can either follow a [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] model, [[Agile management|agile]] model or any other [[software engineering]] practice.

== Purpose ==

UCD asks questions about [[End-user|users]] and their tasks and goals, then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design.
UCD of a web site, for instance, seeks to answer the following questions:
* Who are the users of the document?
* What are the users' tasks and goals?
* What are the users' [[experience]] levels with the document, and documents like it?
* What functions do the users need from the document?
* What [[information]] might the users need, and in what form do they need it?
* How do users think the document should work?
* What are the extreme environments?
* Is the user multitasking?
* Does the interface utilize different inputs modes such as touching, spoken, gestures, or orientation?

== Elements ==

As examples of UCD viewpoints, the essential elements of UCD of a web site are considerations of visibility, accessibility, legibility and language.

=== Visibility ===
[[Visibility]] helps the user construct a [[mental model]] of the document. Models help the user predict the effect(s) of their actions while using the document. Important elements (such as those that aid [[navigation]]) should be emphatic. Users should be able to tell from a glance what they can and cannot do with the document.

=== Accessibility ===
Users should be able to find information quickly and easily throughout the document, regardless of its length. Users should be offered various ways to find information (such as navigational elements, search functions, [[table of contents]], clearly labeled sections, page numbers, [[color-coding]], etc.). Navigational elements should be consistent with the [[genre]] of the document. ‘[[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]]' is a useful strategy that involves breaking information into small pieces that can be organized into some type meaningful order or [[hierarchy]]. The ability to [[Skimming (reading)|skim]] the document allows users to find their piece of information by scanning rather than reading. [[boldface|Bold]] and [[italic type|italic]] words are often used.

=== Legibility ===
Text should be easy to read: Through analysis of the rhetorical situation, the designer should be able to determine a useful [[font]] style. Ornamental fonts and text in all [[capital letters]] are hard to read, but italics and bolding can be helpful when used correctly. Large or small body text is also hard to read. (Screen size of 10-12 pixel sans serif and 12-16 pixel serif is recommended.)
High figure-ground [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between text and background increases legibility. Dark text against a light background is most legible.

=== Language ===
Depending on the rhetorical situation, certain types of [[language]] are needed. Short sentences are helpful, as are well-written texts used in explanations and similar bulk-text situations. Unless the situation calls for it, [[jargon]] or technical terms should not be used. Many writers will choose to use [[active voice]], [[verbs]] (instead of [[Noun phrase|noun strings]] or [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominals]]), and simple sentence structure.

== Rhetorical situation ==
A user-centered design is focused around the [[rhetorical situation]]. The rhetorical situation shapes the design of an information medium. There are three elements to consider in a rhetorical situation: [[Audience]], Purpose, and [[wikt:context|Context]].

=== Audience ===
The audience is the people who will be using the document. The designer must consider their age, geographical location, ethnicity, gender, education, etc.

=== Purpose ===
The purpose is what the document targets or what problem the document is trying to address.

=== Context ===
The context is the circumstances surrounding the situation. The context often answers the question: What situation has prompted the need for this document? Context also includes any social or cultural issues that may surround the situation.

== Analysis tools ==
There are a number of tools that are used in the analysis of user-centered design, mainly: personas, scenarios, and essential use cases.

=== Persona ===
During the UCD process, a [[persona (user experience)|Persona]] representing the user may be created. A persona is a user archetype used to help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design. In most cases, personas are synthesized from a series of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] interviews with real people, then captured in 1-2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment, with a few fictional personal details to bring the persona to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perfecting your ourufrankline {{!}} Cooper Journal|url = http://www.frankouru.com/journal/2001/08/perfecting_your_personas|website = www.cooper.com|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each product, or sometimes for each set of tools within a product, there is a small set of personas, one of whom is the primary focus for the design. There are also what's called a [[secondary persona]], where the character is not the main target of the design, but their needs should be met and problems solved if possible. They exist to help account for further possible problems and difficulties that may occur even though the primary persona is satisfied with their solution. There is also an [[anti-persona]], which is the character that the design is specifically not made for.

Personas are useful in the sense that they create a common shared understanding of the user group for which the design process is built around. Also, they help to prioritize the design considerations by providing a context of what the user needs and what functions are simply nice to add and have. They can also provide a human face and existence to a diversified and scattered user group, and can also create some empathy and add emotions when referring to the users. However, since personas are a generalized perception of the primary stakeholder group from collected data, the characteristics may be too broad and typical, or too much of an "average Joe". Sometimes, personas can have stereotypical properties also, which may hurt the entire design process. Overall, personas can be a useful tool to be used by designers to make informed design decisions around, opposed to referring to a set of data or a wide range of individuals.

=== Scenario ===
A [[scenario]] created in the UCD process is a fictional story about the "daily life of" or a sequence of events with the primary stakeholder group as the main character. Typically, a persona that was created earlier is used as the main character of this story. The story should be specific of the events happening that relate to the problems of the primary stakeholder group, and normally the main research questions the design process is built upon. These may turn out to be a simple story about the daily life of an individual, but small details from the events should imply details about the users, and may include emotional or physical characteristics. There can be the "best-case scenario", where everything works out best for the main character, the "worst-case scenario", where the main character experiences everything going wrong around him or her, and an "average-case scenario", which is the typical life of the individual, where nothing really special or really depressing occurs, and the day just moves on.

Scenarios create a social context in which the personas exist, and also create an actual physical world, instead of imagining a character with internal characteristics from gathered data and nothing else; there is more action involved in the persona's existence. A scenario is also more easily understood by people, since it is in the form of a story, and is easier to follow. Yet, like the personas, these scenarios are assumptions made by the researcher and designer, and is also created from a set of organized data. Some even say such scenarios are unrealistic to real life occurrences. Also, it is difficult to explain and inform low level tasks that occur, like the thought process of the persona before acting.

=== Use case ===
In short, a [[use case]] describes the interaction between an individual and the rest of the world. Each use case describes an event that may occur for a short period of time in real life, but may consist of intricate details and interactions between the actor and the world. It is represented as a series of simple steps for the character to achieve his or her goal, in the form of a cause-and effect scheme. Use cases are normally written in the form of a chart with two columns: first column labelled actor, second column labelled world, and the actions performed by each side written in order in the respective columns. The following is an example of a use case for performing a song on a guitar in front of an audience.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Actor
! World
|-
| choose music to play
|
|-
| pick up guitar
|
|-
|
| display sheet music
|-
| perform each note on sheet music using guitar
|
|-
|
| convey note to audience using sound
|-
|
| audience provides feedback to performer
|-
| assess performance and adjust as needed based on audience feedback.
|
|-
| complete song with required adjustments
|
|-
|
| audience applause
|}

The interaction between actor and the world is an act that can be seen in everyday life, and we take them as granted and don't think too much about the small detail that needs to happen in order for an act like performing a piece of music to exist. It is similar to the fact that when speaking our mother tongue, we don't think too much about grammar and how to phrase words; they just come out since we are so used to saying them. The actions between an actor and the world, notably, the primary stakeholder (user) and the world in this case, should be thought about in detail, and hence use cases are created to understand how these tiny interactions occur.

An essential use case is a special kind of use case, also called an "abstract use case." Essential use cases describe the essence of the problem, and deals with the nature of the problem itself. While writing use cases, no assumptions about unrelated details should be made. In additions, the goals of the subject should be separated from the process and implementation to reach that particular goal. Below is an example of an essential use case with the same goal as the former example.

{| class="wikitable"
! Actor
! World
|-
| choose sheet music to perform
|
|-
| gathers necessary resources
|
|-
|
| provides access to resources
|-
| performs piece sequentially
|
|-
|
| convey and interprets performance
|-
|
| provides feedback
|-
| completes performance
|
|}

Use cases are useful because they help identify useful levels of design work. They allow the designers to see the actual low level processes that are involved for a certain problem, which makes the problem easier to handle, since certain minor steps and details the user makes are exposed. The designers' job should take into consideration of these small problems in order to arrive at a final solution that works. Another way to say this is that use cases breaks a complicated task into smaller bits, where these bits are useful units. Each bit completes a small task, which then builds up to the final bigger task. Like writing code on a computer, it is easier to write the basic smaller parts and make them work first, and then put them together to finish the larger more complicated code, instead to tackling the entire code from the very beginning.

The first solution is less risky because if something goes wrong with the code, it is easier to look for the problem in the smaller bits, since the segment with the problem will be the one that does not work, while in the latter solution, the programmer may have to look through the entire code to search for a single error, which proves time consuming. The same reasoning goes for writing use cases in UCD. Lastly, use cases convey useful and important tasks where the designer can see which one are of higher importance than others. Some drawbacks of writing use cases include the fact that each action, by the actor or the world, consist of little detail, and is simply a small action. This may possibly lead to further imagination and different interpretation of action from different designers.

Also, during the process, it is really easy to oversimplify a task, since a small task from a larger task may consist of even smaller tasks. Picking up a guitar may involve thinking of which guitar to pick up, which pick to use, and think about where the guitar is located first. These tasks may then be divided into smaller tasks, such as first thinking of what colour of guitar fits the place to perform the piece, and other related details. Tasks may be split further down into even tinier tasks, and it is up to the designer to determine what is a suitable place to stop splitting up the tasks. Tasks may not only be oversimplified, they may also be omitted in whole, thus the designer should be aware of all the detail and all the key steps that are involved in an event or action when writing use cases.

'''''War and Peace in the Global Village''''' by [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Quentin Fiore]] is a collage of images and text that illustrates the effects of electronic media and new technology on man.  Marshall McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a major inspiration for this study of war throughout history as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future. (1st Ed.: Bantam, NY; reissued by [[Gingko Press]], 2001  {{ISBN|1-58423-074-6}}),

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.
