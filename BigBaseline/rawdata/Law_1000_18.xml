'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Access to information, just as [[media independence]] and pluralism remain critical issues in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/moldova-stakeholder-submission-universal-periodic-review |title=Moldova: stakeholder Submission for the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |date=28 March 2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher= Freedom House|access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=Jurnal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jurnal.md/en/politic/2016/10/14/access-to-information-more-and-more-difficult-in-moldova-things-that-are-in-fact-of-public-interest-are-excessively-and-abusively-kept-secret/  |title=Access to information, more and more difficult in Moldova; “Things that  are, in fact, of public interest are excessively and abusively kept secret” |last= |first= |date=14 October 2016 |website=Jurnal.md |publisher=Jurnal online |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; In 2014, the [[Independent Journalism Center (IJC)]] presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law has not yet been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title= Report on the State of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url= http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher= Eastern Partnership. Civil Society Forum |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Director of the [[Association of Independent Press]], Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.&lt;ref name=Jurnal/&gt;

==Legal framework==

The right to access public information in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti-rating.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/files/pdf/Moldova.pdf Republic of Moldova. The Law on Access Information. Retrieved 23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy.  Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged for the cost of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher= Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended by five days in case of requests of large numbers of documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal data, confidential business data, and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The [[Ombudsman]] in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

One of the problem in enforcing the right to access public information is impunity, meaning that the law establishes only insignificant fines on public offices who fail to provide due access to information. Also, in many cases, the information provided by state bodies is shaped in the officials' favor, giving the impression that authorities are behaving in compliance with the law, while in fact depriving the requester the information they are seeking. Moreover, in many cases officials do not provide public interest information without the approval from a supervisor and often refuse to answers telephone calls from journalists, thus increasing the time for getting the required information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Another problem concerns the costs for obtaining public information and the fees charged to the requester, despite some improvements made recently, such as the introduction of a public register through the [[E-government|E-Government]] service in 2014. This affects in particular newsrooms and investigative journalists that must pay large sums of money for getting data useful for their investigative work.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

'''Anarchist law''' is a hypothetical body of norms regarding behavior and decision-making that might be operative in an anarchist community. The term is used in  a series of ongoing debates within the various branches of [[anarchist]] theory regarding if and how norms of individual and/or collective behavior, [[decision-making]] and actions should be created and enforced.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
The term ''basic law'' is used in some places as an alternative to "[[constitution]]", implying it is a ''temporary but necessary measure'' without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a [[codified constitution]], or in countries with [[uncodified constitution]]s, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In [[West Germany]] the term "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (''Grundgesetz'') was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate [[reunification of Germany]]. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.

The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]].

The term '''break/fix''' refers to the fee-for-service method of providing [[information technology]] (IT) services to businesses.  Using this method an IT solution provider performs services as needed and bills the customer only for the work done.  The service may include repairs, upgrades or installation of systems, components, peripheral equipment, networking or software.

The alternative to break/fix is '''managed services''', which is a [[service plan]], where the customer pays a fixed amount for services covered in the plan and pays additional amounts for repairs or other work which is not covered in the plan. 

The equivalent practice in the consumer market is that of out-of-warranty appliances, where the customer can pay for repairs as needed (break/fix) or they can buy an [[extended warranty]] (managed services).

'''Advantages:'''

Possible lower cost (at first).

'''Disadvantages:'''

Since problems are only addressed when they arise, maintenance is reactive rather than proactive.  Small problems left unaddressed due to shortsightedness because of cost can balloon to major failures.

Unscrupulous providers are incentivized to use inefficient or malicious means to increase break/fix work and thus increase their revenue.

The '''''Canada Gazette''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Gazette du Canada'''}}) is the official newspaper of the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Collections&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Carole|title=A Glance at the Canada Gazette: Past, Present and Future|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gazette-du-canada/035001-2000-e.html|work=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on October 2, 1841.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deavy|first=Betty|author2=Gauld, Norma|title=The Canada Gazette|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|date=1994|volume=17|issue=2|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=149&amp;art=1005|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally it published all acts of the [[Parliament of Canada]], it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt;  At one time it contained information on bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt; It has been administered by [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]] and the [[Queen's Printer]] since 1841. The ''Gazette'' is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

==Legal status==
While not always widely read by the public, publication in the ''Gazette'' is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] and then the [[Cabinet of Canada]], the regulation is published in the ''Gazette''.&lt;ref name="Can Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernhardt|first=Peter|title=Understanding the Regulation Making Process|url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=245&amp;param=82|work=Canadian Parliamentary Review|accessdate=7 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a regulation has not been published in the ''Gazette'', a person cannot be convicted of the offence.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Statutory Instruments Act|year=1985|section=11|subsection=2|abbr=RSO|chapter=S-22|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] all have their own equivalents of the ''Gazette''.

==Publishing==
From inception in 1841 until 1998, the ''Gazette'' was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt; From 1 April 2014 onwards, it will only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make "electronic publishing its new standard for all documents".&lt;ref name="online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|title=Discontinuance of the Printed Copy of the Canada Gazette — Reminder|publisher=Canada Gazette Directorate|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303200747/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2013/0705-eng.asp|title=Government of Canada moves to e-printing|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structurally, the ''Gazette'' is published in three parts:

===Part I===
Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation.&lt;ref name="Can Review" /&gt; Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

===Part II===
Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.

===Part III===
Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received [[Royal Assent]] and was first published in 1974.  Starting from January 1998 all  publications other than Part III are available in [[HTML]] and are not official.  From  April 1, 2003, the [[PDF]] version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders in council relating to the coming into force of federal acts.

==Exemptions==
Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the ''Gazette''. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defense or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4025">In [[legal research]], a '''citator''' is a [[citation index]] of legal resources, one of the best-known of which in the [[United States]] is [[Shepard's Citations]].  Given a reference of a legal decision, a citator allows the researcher to find newer documents which cite the original document and thus to reconstruct the judicial history of cases and statutes. Using a citator in this way is [[colloquially]] referred to as "Shepardizing".

==Use in legal research==
===Topical research===
Because cases cite related cases, citators can be used to find cases which are on topics related to a given topic.  A common research strategy is to use "one good case" to find related cases.

===Establishing authority===
Another important application is to determine whether the conclusions of one case have been followed, overturned, or modified in later cases, especially by higher courts. This is important for legal systems in which the binding authority of a case is contingent on [[precedent]].

Citators often include annotations indicating the history and treatment of a case in citing opinions.  Shepard's notes 'history' as '''a'''ffirmed, '''m'''odified, '''r'''eversed, '''s'''ame case, '''S'''uperseded, or '''v'''acated; and 'treatment' as '''c'''riticised, '''d'''istinguished, '''e'''xplained, '''j''' dissenting opinion, '''~''' consenting opinion, '''L'''imited, '''o'''verruled, or '''q'''uestioned.

Although originally distributed only as printed and bound volumes, citators are now typically on-line services such as [[LexisNexis]]'s online ''Shepard's Citations'', Justis Publishing's provider-neutral [[JustCite]], [[Westlaw]]'s KeyCite, [[Bloomberg Law]]'s BCite, and the Oxford Law Citator of [[Oxford University Press]].

==History==

Citation indexes to the Bible date to the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Citation index]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In English legal literature, volumes of judicial reports included lists of cases cited in that volume starting with ''Raymond's Reports'' (1743) and followed by ''Douglas's Reports'' (1783). Simon Greenleaf (1821) published an alphabetical list of cases with notes on later decisions affecting the precedential authority of the original decision.&lt;ref name='shapiro'/&gt;

The first true citation index dates to the 1860 publication of Labatt's ''Table of Cases...California...'', followed in 1872 by Wait's ''Table of Cases...New York...''. But the most important and best-known citation index came with the 1873 publication of [[Shepard's Citations]].&lt;ref name='shapiro'&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "Origins of Bibliometrics, Citation Indexing, and Citation Analysis: The Neglected Legal Literature" ''Journal of the American Society of Information Science'' '''43''':5:337-339 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Shepard Company started publishing citators in New York City in 1873 and other companies provided similar services at around the same time, ''e.g.'' George Fred Williams's ''Massachusetts citations: a table of cases, overruled, denied, doubted, criticised, approved, and cited by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]]'' (Boston, 1878).

The name 'citator' appears to have been coined by the Citator Publishing Company (Detroit) in 1908 in ''The Citator: an annotated compilation of citations of the [[Kansas Supreme Court]]...''.

{{Rights |Human}}

'''Civil and political rights''' are a class of [[rights]] that protect [[individual]]s' [[political freedom|freedom]] from infringement by [[government]]s, [[social organization]]s, and private individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the society and [[State (polity)|state]] without [[discrimination]] or [[Political repression|repression]].

Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental [[integrity]], [[right to life|life]], and [[safety]]; protection from discrimination on grounds such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ageing|age]], [[Political party|political affiliation]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], and [[disability]];&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Rights act of 1964, [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97 ourdocuments.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ada.htm accessboard.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summary of LGBT civil rights protections, by state, at Lambda Legal, [http://www.lambdalegal.org/states-regions/ lambdalegal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[individual rights]] such as [[privacy]] and the freedoms of [[freedom of thought|thought]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[freedom of movement|movement]].

Political rights include [[natural justice]] (procedural fairness) in [[law]], such as the [[rights of the accused]], including the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[due process]]; the right to seek redress or a [[legal remedy]]; and rights of [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in [[civil society]] and [[politics]] such as [[freedom of association]], the [[right to assemble]], the [[right to petition]], the [[right of self-defense]], and the [[Suffrage|right to vote]].

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;A useful survey is Paul Sieghart, ''The Lawful Rights of Mankind: An Introduction to the International Legal Code of Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise the first portion of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (with [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] comprising the second portion). The theory of [[three generations  of human rights]] considers this group of rights to be "first-generation rights", and the theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers them to be generally [[negative rights]].

==History==
The phrase "Rights for Civil" is a translation of Latin ''ius civis'' (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (''libertas'') or servile (''servitus''), but they all had rights in law.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, T. Lambert, ''Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, Including the History and'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey William Bromiley, ''The encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of [[Kett's Rebellion]] (1549), "all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/humanrights/1500-1760/ |title=Human Rights: 1500-1760 - Background |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Parliament of England]] adopted the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by [[George Mason]] and [[James Madison]] when drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] (1789).

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a "civil disability". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase "civil rights" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] support for civil rights was divided, with many  politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] restored their civil rights.

In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted [[Civil Rights Act (disambiguation)|civil rights acts]] in [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|1866]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|1871]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1875|1875]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]], and [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991]].

==Protection of rights==
[[T. H. Marshall]] notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are [[constitutional right]]s and are included in a [[bill of rights]] or similar document. They are also defined in [[international human rights instruments]], such as the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the 1967 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected, although most [[Democracy|democracies]] worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote in his ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' that "a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their [[chief magistrate]]."

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. In many countries, [[citizen]]s have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens; at the same time, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all [[person]]s.

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Regilme |first=Salvador Santino F., Jr. |date=3 October 2014 |title=The Social Science of Human Rights: The Need for a 'Second Image Reversed'? |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2014.946255 |work=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1390–1405 |doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.946255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rights==
[[Custom (law)|Custom]] also plays a role. Implied or [[unenumerated rights]] are rights that [[court]]s may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] states that people have unalienable rights including "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm House Bill 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001010710/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movements for civil rights==
{{Main article|Movements for civil rights}}

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of [[law]]s, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even [[social unrest]] may ensue.

Some historians suggest that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=Louisiana's Free People of Color-Digitization Grant-letter in support|url=https://www.academia.edu/3505760/Louisianas_Free_People_of_Color-Digitization_grant_awarded_to_LSU_Hill_library_others|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; W.C.C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson to be governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803. Free men of colour had been members of the militia for decades under both Spanish and French control of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Clarence|title=The Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans|year=1940|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, in early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans, under Governor Claiborne, was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, i.e., the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established "colored" militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising, etc|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter to Claiborne from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn that "it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Dunbar|title=Official Letter Books of W.C.C. Claiborne, 1801-1816|year=1917|publisher=Mississippi Dept. of Archives &amp; History|volume=2|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;"Signatures to the Seneca Falls Convention 'Declaration of Sentiments{{'"}}. American History Online, Facts On File, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2014}} Consciously modeled after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Declaration of Rights and Sentiments]] became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn.

Worldwide, several [[political movement]]s for [[equality before the law]] occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:

* the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States, where rights of black citizens had been violated;
* the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], formed in 1967 following failures in this province of the [[United Kingdom]] to respect the Roman Catholic minority's rights; and
* movements in many Communist countries, such as the [[Prague Spring]] and [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the uprisings in Hungary.

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of [[civil resistance]], using [[nonviolent]] methods to achieve their aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by [[civil unrest]] and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

==Problems and analysis==
Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other [[individual]]s, or from [[corporation]]s—e.g., in what way should [[employment discrimination]] in the [[private sector]] be dealt with?

[[Political theory]] deals with civil and political rights. [[Robert Nozick]] and [[John Rawls]] expressed competing visions in Nozick's ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' and Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Other influential authors in the area include [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]], and [[Jean Edward Smith]].

==First-generation rights==
First-generation rights, often called "purple" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly [[individual and group rights|individualistic]]: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], (in some countries) the [[right to keep and bear arms]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered in the [[United States]] by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

The civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for blacks to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. In 1868, the  14th amendment to the constitution gave blacks equal protection under the law.
In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of "equal protection of the laws" expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment.

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Maine]] Criminal Code holds that "Conduct that the person believes to be necessary to avoid imminent physical harm to that person or another is justifiable if the desirability and urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the statute defining the crime charged. The desirability and urgency of such conduct may not rest upon considerations pertaining to the morality and advisability of such statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-a/title17-Asec103.html|title=§103.

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

A '''curfew''' is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/curfew|title=curfew - definition of curfew in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/curfew|title=Curfew - Define Curfew at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the head of a household to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair|au pair ]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.

== Etymology ==
The word "curfew" comes from the [[French language|French]] phrase "''couvre-feu''", which means "fire cover". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as "curfeu", which later became the modern "curfew".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|curfew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.
# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].
# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a "curfew" time. In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] declared a country-wide military enforced curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-protests-mubarak-army-curfew | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Jack | last1=Shenker | first2=Peter | last2=Beaumont | first3=Sam | last3=Jones | title=Egypt (News),Middle East and North Africa (News) MENA,World news,Hosni Mubarak,Mohamed ElBaradei,Africa (News) | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/29/egypt-jail-break-700-prisoners-escape_n_815872.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Cara | last=Parks | title=Massive Egyptian Prison Break Frees 700 Inmates | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President [[Mohamed Morsi]] who declared a curfew in [[Port Said]], [[Ismaïlia]], and [[Suez]], three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/63539.aspx|title=Suez Canal residents defy President Morsi's curfew|work=ahram.org.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizing football tournaments and street festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323375204578269700878491978|title=Egyptians Defy President's Curfew, as Unrest Spreads|author=Matt Bradley|date=29 January 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew.

===Iceland===
Under [[Iceland|Iceland's]] Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2002080.html "Child Protection",
2002 no. 80 May 10th&lt;/ref&gt;, children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.

Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order. Under the [[State_of_emergency#Sri_Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/5405822.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Wear - Late night youth curfew a success|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government’s ‘Anti-Yob’/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem "[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|title=peak district local history, customs, wildlife, transport - Peakland Heritage|work=peaklandheritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serve their original function.

===United States of America===

====Juvenile curfews====
Curfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.
Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state&lt;ref&gt;[http://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/ Curfews in the State of New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and even by county or municipality. In some cities there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192
|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|title=Curfews » City of Faribault, MN|work=faribault.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034013/http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/juvenile-curfew-laws-arrests/|title="Impact of Juvenile Curfew Laws on Arrests of Youth and Adults" at Journalist's Resource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;https://jjie.org/2013/10/14/op-ed-why-dont-youth-curfews-work/ OP-ED: Why Don’t Youth Curfews Work?, Mike Males | October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/repealing-juvenile-curfew-laws-could-make-cities-safer/ 
Repealing juvenile curfew laws could make cities safer
Jennifer L. DoleacTuesday, December 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/31/the-curfew-myth The Curfew Myth, Ivonne Roman&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also concerns about [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_curfew_data_93_per.html|title=New Orleans curfew data: 93 percent of curfew arrestees are black|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about racial profiling, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514002127/http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mall curfews====
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|title=Upscale Mall Enforces Teen Curfew &amp; Dress Code|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northparkcenter.com/Code-of-Conduct|title=Code of Conduct - NorthPark Center|work=northparkcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies are known as ''mall curfews.'' Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as ''parental escort policies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|title=Parental Escort Policy|work=mallofamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curfews for all====
States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely [[inclement weather]] or [[political dissent|political unrest]]. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as [[elected official]]s, [[law enforcement]] personnel, [[first responder]]s, [[health care]] workers, and the [[mass media]].

In 2015, the city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]].

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration.  That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

===New Zealand===
Curfew laws do not exist in New Zealand and therefore cannot be legally enforced by Police.

'''Deliberative process privilege''' is the [[common-law]] principle that the internal processes of the executive branch of a government are immune from normal disclosure or discovery in civil litigations, [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests, etc.

The theory behind the protection is that by guaranteeing confidentiality, the government will receive better or more candid advice, recommendations and opinions, resulting in better decisions for society as a whole.  The deliberative process privilege is often in [[dynamic tension]] with the principle of maximal transparency in government.

In the context of the U.S. presidential offices and their workproducts, this principle is often referred to as [[executive privilege]], or as a type of executive privilege that is distinct from "presidential communications privilege".

{{other uses2|Dignitas}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

'''''Dignitas''''' is a [[Latin]] word referring to a unique, intangible, and culturally subjective [[Society|social]] concept in the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] mindset. The word does not have a direct translation in [[English language|English]]. Some interpretations include "[[dignity]]", which is a ''derivation'' from "dignitas", and "[[:wikt:prestige|prestige]]" or "charisma".

With respect to ancient Rome, ''dignitas'' was regarded as the sum of the personal clout and influence that a male citizen acquired throughout his life. When weighing the ''dignitas'' of a particular individual, factors such as personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth had to be considered, along with the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment.

==Origins==
Authors who had used ''dignitas'' extensively in their writings and oratories include [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Tacitus]], and [[Livy]]. The most prolific user was Cicero, who initially related it to the established term ''[[auctoritas]]'' ([[authority]]). These two words were highly associated, with the latter defined as the expression of a man's ''dignitas''.

==Personal significance==
The cultivation of ''dignitas'' in ancient Rome was extremely personal. Men of all classes, most particularly noblemen of [[consul]]ar families, were highly protective and zealous of this asset. This is because every man who took on a higher political office during the [[Roman Republic]] considered ''dignitas'' as comprising much more than just his dignity. It referred to his "good name" (his past and present [[reputation]], achievement, standing, and honor). Its importance within the [[Social class in ancient Rome| hierarchical classes of Roman society ]] meant many historical figures would kill, commit [[suicide]] (e.g. [[Mark Antony]]), or enter [[exile]] in order to preserve their ''dignitas''.

==Influence on conflict==
The personal significance of one's ''dignitas'' had encouraged several conflicts in ancient Rome. [[Florus]] claimed that the stubbornness of [[Cato the Younger]] had driven [[Pompeius Magnus]] to prepare defenses in order to build up his ''dignitas''. Cicero wrote that Caesar valued his status so greatly that he did not want anyone to be his equal in ''dignitas''. [[Aulus Hirtius]] had written that [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 51 BC)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], who was one of the instigators of Caesar’s recall from Gaul, had attempted to build all of his own reputation on his success on turning people’s feelings against Caesar. Whether the exact term was used much during these times is unknown; however, the concept of ''dignitas'' was certainly influential and worth fighting for.

==Changing definition==
Over the course of ancient Roman history, ''dignitas'' had never taken on all of the aforementioned descriptions simultaneously. The term took on different meanings over time, adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society, politicians, and the various authors.

Years after Caesar's death, his heir [[Augustus]] rejected the contemporary meaning of ''dignitas''. Augustus found the related term ''[[auctoritas]]'' to be a suitable alternative.

In 46 BC, Cicero cited the ambiguous nature of the concept of ''dignitas''. He wrote, "And so I have, if loyal feeling for the state and winning good men's approval of those loyal feelings is all that ''dignitas'' amounts to; but if in ''dignitas'' you include the power of translating those loyal feelings into action or of defending them with complete freedom, then ''ne vestigium quidem ullum est reliquum nobis dignitatis'' [not even a trace is left to us of our dignity]."

==Combination of dignitas and otium==
When paired with the term ''[[otium]]'', the word ''dignitas'' took on a different meaning. Cicero did not consider himself worthy of having ''dignitas'' alone because he felt that&amp;mdash;by turning his back on the Roman public&amp;mdash;he had neglected the duty of one whose life had normally exemplified the concept. He then altered the definition to mean "[lifetime] impact," to better describe his unique status. By this time, Cicero's political life had ended, and he labeled his past political influence as his ''dignitas'', and his present standing as ''otium''.

Bartlett]]'', 465 U.S. 463 (1984), that "only Congress may diminish the boundaries of an Indian reservation, and its intent to do so must be clear."&lt;ref name="slipopinion"&gt;''Nebraska v. Parker'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1406_6536.pdf No. 14–1406], 577 U.S. ____ (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; This was noted in the Court's 2016 case ''[[Nebraska v. Parker]]'', 577 U.S. ___ (2016), in which the Court held that an 1882 Act passed by Congress did not diminish the [[Omaha Reservation]].

The ''Solem'' case established a "diminishment doctrine" that U.S. courts could use when evaluating whether diminishment had taken place.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/enrd/solem-v-bartlett Solem V. Bartlett | ENRD | Department of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 case ''[[Hagen v. Utah]]'', 510 U.S. 399 (1994), the Supreme Court held that Congress's 1902 Act had diminished the [[Uintah Reservation]].&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-6281.ZS.html Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.S. 399 (1994).]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court applied its doctrine established in the ''Solem'' case.

==Notes==
Diminishment commonly refers to the reduction in size of a reservation. A finding of diminishment generally suggests that a discrete, easily identifiable parcel of land has been removed from reservation status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BIRKHOLD|first1=MATTHEW H.|title=JUDGING "INDIAN CHARACTER"?

{{legal status}}
In [[Customary international law|customary]] [[international law]], an '''enemy [[alien (law)|alien]]''' is any native, citizen, denizen or subject of any foreign nation or government with which a domestic nation or government is in conflict and who are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed.   Usually, but not always, the countries are in a state of declared war.

==United Kingdom==
At the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, the United Kingdom had become a place of refuge for people who had fled Nazi persecution, including Jews and political refugees. At first, the authorities [[Defence Regulation 18B|interned]] these refugees with other enemy residents, without distinction. Later on, when Italy also declared war, significant numbers of Italian residents were also interned.

The [[Isle of Man]], relatively isolated from the British mainland and with a useful amount of holiday accommodation, was used to provide housing for the "Alien Civilians" (as it had in World War I). There were also efforts to move internees from Britain. In July, 1940, the ''[[Arandora Star]]'' was torpedoed and sunk while transporting Italian and German aliens to North America; 743 died, including prisoners, crew and guards. The 813 surviving prisoners were subsequently included in the 2,500 men transported by [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']] for internment in [[Hay, New South Wales]].

The [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]] was apparently the only British unit that enemy aliens could serve in early in the war. Many thousands of Germans and Austrians joined the Pioneer Corps to assist the Allied war efforts and liberation of their home countries. These were mainly Jews and political opponents of the Nazi Regime who had fled to Britain while it was still possible, and included the cinematographer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]] and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. These men - often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens" - later moved on to serve in fighting units. Some were recruited by [[Special Operations Executive]] (S.O.E.) as secret agents. They were instructed to choose an "English" name using their old initials.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as German nationals in the British forces was particularly dangerous, since, in case of taken captive, with a high probability they would have been executed as traitors by the Germans. Also, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their profound knowledge of the German language and customs proved useful. Many of them served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeochannel.co.uk/programmes/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|Japanese-American internment|German-American internment|Italian-American internment}}
A well-known example of enemy aliens were the Japanese citizens residing in the United States during [[World War II]]. Many of these Japanese and Japanese Americans were imprisoned in [[Internment|internment camps]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] during wartime, alongside many German- and Italian-Americans. However, many [[Nisei#American Nisei|Japanese Americans]] and Italian-Americans were not actually "aliens", as they held American citizenship. The term "enemy alien" referred only to non-American citizens who were nationals of [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries. Included in this number were thousands of resident aliens who were prohibited from applying for citizenship by [[Naturalization Act of 1870|race-based naturalization laws]]; when war was declared against their native countries, their status changed from "resident" to "enemy" alien.  Therefore, German American, Italian American and Japanese American permanent residents were classified as enemy aliens and interned as such. In total 10,905 Italian Americans and approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned in many different camps and sites across the country.  German Americans were held in more than 50 different locations.

Citizens of an enemy country who lived in the USA during World War II were required to have an "Enemy Alien" card and register monthly with the authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17561">An '''entrenched clause''' or '''entrenchment clause''' of a [[basic law]] or [[constitution]] is a provision that makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass, making such amendments inadmissible. Overriding an entrenched clause may require a [[supermajority]], a [[referendum]], or the consent of the minority party.

Once adopted, a properly drafted entrenchment clause makes some portion of a basic law or constitution irrevocable except through the assertion of the [[right of revolution]].

Any amendment to a basic law or constitution which would not satisfy the prerequisites enshrined in a valid entrenched clause would lead to so-called "unconstitutional constitutional law", that is, an amendment to constitutional law text that would appear to be constitutional law by its form, albeit unconstitutional due to the procedure used to enact it or due to the content of its provisions.

Entrenched clauses are, in some cases, justified as protecting the rights of a minority from the dangers of [[majoritarianism]]. In other cases, the objective may be to prevent amendments to the basic law or constitution which would pervert the fundamental principles enshrined in it. However, entrenched clauses are often challenged by their opponents as being undemocratic.

[[Eternity clause]]s are a type of entrenched clause.

==Australia==

As Australian Parliaments have inherited the British principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], they may not entrench themselves by a regular act. Therefore, the entrenchment of the national flag in the ''Flags Act'' of 1953 is without force as the entrenchment clause could be removed (through normal legislative amendment) by later parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;Speech by the Hon. David Jull, MP – Minister for Administrative Services 2001 [http://www.samuelgriffith.org.au/papers/html/volume7/v7chap3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth Constitution]] is entrenched as it may only be amended by referendum; the amendment must gain the support of a majority of Australian voters nationwide, plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. These provisions are specified in [[Chapter VIII of the Australian Constitution|section 128]]. The Imperial Parliament's power to amend it in Australian law was limited by the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|''Statute of Westminster Adoption Act'' 1942]] and terminated by the [[Australia Act|''Australia Act'' 1986]].

State laws respecting the constitution, powers or procedure of the parliament of a state need to follow any restrictions specified in state law on such acts, by virtue of section 6 of the ''Australia Act''. This power does not extend to the whole constitution of the state, and the Parliament of Queensland has ignored entrenchments in amending its constitution.&lt;ref name="twomey"&gt;Anne Twomey. [http://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/sites/gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/files/mdocs/5_AnneTwomey.pdf Manner and Form]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is possible that the entrenchment clauses are unentrenchable, preventing state law from having effectively entrenching clauses.&lt;ref name="twomey"/&gt;

==Brazil==
Entrenched clauses of the [[Constitution of Brazil]] are listed in Article 60, Paragraph 4:

{{quote|No proposal of amendment shall be considered which is aimed at abolishing:&lt;br/&gt;
I – the federative form of State;&lt;br/&gt;
II – the direct, secret, universal and periodic vote;&lt;br/&gt;
III – the separation of the Government Powers;&lt;br/&gt;
IV – individual rights and guarantees.
}}

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

Article X of the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], defining the amendment procedure, provides in paragraph 2 that the rights and freedoms as established in Article II of the Constitution may not be eliminated or diminished, and that the paragraph 2 itself may not be altered.

==Czech Republic==
Article 9 of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitution]], which concerns [[Amendments|supplementing and amending]] the Constitution, states that "the substantive requisites of the democratic, law-abiding State may not be amended." This provision was invoked in 2009 when the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] abolished a [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Act]] adopted to invoke one off early legislative election. The disputed act was seen as an individual decision in violation of then-effective constitutional procedure regulating early elections.

==France==
The [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] states in Title XVI, Article 89, On [[Amendments]] to the Constitution, "The [[republic]]an form of government shall not be the object of any amendment" thus forbidding the restoration of the [[monarchy]] or the [[empire]].

==Germany==
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Grundgesetz'') provides in its [[eternity clause]] (Article&amp;nbsp;79 section&amp;nbsp;3) that any amendment would be "inadmissible" if such amendment would provide that the Federal Republic would not consist of states (''Länder'') any more, that the states would no longer be entitled to participate in the federal law-making procedures, or if "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20 would be affected. "The basic principles" are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." (Article 1)
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." (Article 1 Paragraph 2)
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." (Article 1 Paragraph 3)
* '''Republic''' (form of government): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* '''Rule of law''' ''(Rechtsstaat)'': "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." (Article 20 Paragraph 3)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." (Article 20 Paragraphs 2–3)

The original purpose of this eternity clause was to ensure that the establishment of any [[dictatorship]] in Germany would be clearly illegal; in legal practice the clause was used by plaintiffs at the Federal Constitutional Court challenging constitutional amendments that affected Articles 1, 10, 19, 101, and 103 regarding restrictions of legal recourse.  Although these basic principles are protected from being repealed, their particular expression may still be amended; such as to clarify, extend or refine an entrenched principle.

==Honduras==
The [[Constitution of Honduras]] has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, "It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period."&lt;ref name="georgetown_const_82-05_art374"&gt;{{citation | title= Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374 | publisher= [[Georgetown University]] | work= Political Database of the Americas | url= http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html | language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unmodifiable article has played an important role in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].

==Indonesia==
The Article 37 on the Chapter 16 of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] manages constitutional amendment procedure, yet it also specifies that the [[unitary state]] status of [[Indonesia]] is unmodifiable.

==Ireland==
There are several examples of entrenched clauses which ultimately failed in their objectives, since their protections were undermined in unintended ways. The [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] was required in parts to be consistent with the 1922 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], including the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] and the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]]. The checks to protect this were removed by, for example, the Irish taking control of advice to the Governor-General, and when the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]] proved obstructive, its abolition.

==Italy==
Article 139 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], promulgated in 1947, provides that the republican form of government shall not be a matter for constitutional amendment.

==Malaysia==
Another example of entrenchment would be the entrenching of portions of the [[Malaysian Constitution]] related to the [[Social contract (Malaysia)|Malaysian social contract]], which specifies that citizenship be granted to the substantial [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Indian Malaysian|Indian]] immigrant populations in return for the recognition of a special position for the indigenous [[Malay people|Malay]] majority. The Constitution did not initially contain an entrenched clause; indeed, one of the articles later entrenched, [[Article 153]], was initially intended to be subject to a [[sunset clause]]. However, after the [[May 13 incident]] of racial rioting in 1969, [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] passed the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971. The Act permitted criminalisation of the questioning of Articles 152, 153, 181, and Part III of the Constitution.

Article 152 designates the [[Malay language]] as the national language of Malaysia; Article 153 grants the Malays special privileges; Article 181 covers the position of the [[Malay rulers]]; and Part III deals with matters of citizenship. The restrictions, which even covered Members of Parliament, made the repeal of these sections of the Constitution unamendable or repealable by ''de facto''; however, to entrench them further, the Act also amended Article 159(5), which covers Constitutional amendments, to prohibit the amending of the aforementioned Articles, as well as Article 159(5), without the consent of the [[Conference of Rulers]] &amp;mdash; a non-elected body comprising the rulers of the [[Malay states]] and the governors of the other states.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, Boo Teik (1995). ''Paradoxes of Mahathirism'', pp. 104&amp;ndash;106. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|967-65-3094-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Section 268 of the Electoral Act (part of the [[Constitution of New Zealand]]) declares that the law governing the maximum term of Parliament, along with certain provisions of the Electoral Act relating to the [[Redistribution (election)|redistribution]] of electoral boundaries, the voting age, and the [[secret ballot]], may only be altered either by three-quarters of the entire membership of the House of Representatives, or by a majority of valid votes in a popular [[referendum]]. Section 268 itself is not protected by this provision, so a government could legally repeal Section 268 and go on to alter the entrenched portions of law, both with a mere [[majority|simple majority]] in Parliament.

==South Africa==
Another example of a failed entrenched clause was in the [[South Africa Act]], the initial constitution of the [[Union of South Africa]]. The constitution's entrenched clauses protected [[suffrage|voting rights]] in the [[Cape Province]], including those of some [[Coloured]]s, but they lost their votes after the Government restructured the Senate and packed it with its sympathisers so that they were able to achieve the required supermajority in what is known as the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]].

==Turkey==
Article 4 of Part 1 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] states that the "provision of Article 1 of the Constitution establishing the form of the state as a Republic, the provisions in Article 2 on the characteristics of the Republic, and the provision of Article 3 shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed."

==United Kingdom==
{{expandsect|date=October 2016}}
The doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary supremacy]] holds that Parliament may pass any law it wishes, including that it can't be limited by previous laws.

Notions of entrenchment have emerged in consideration of a number of constitutional statutes, including the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. (See ''[[Jackson v A-G]]'' [2005].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young |first=Alison L. |year=2006 |title=Hunting Sovereignty: Jackson v Her Majesty's Attorney-General |journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]] |volume=2006 |issue=2 |pages=187–196 |publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell |issn=0033-3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

[[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the [[United States Constitution]] temporarily shielded certain clauses in Article I from being amended. The [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Slave trade|first]] clause in Section 9, which prevented Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of [[History of slavery|slaves]] prior to 1808, and the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Apportionment of direct taxes|fourth]] clause in that same section, a declaration that [[direct tax#U.S. constitutional law sense|direct taxes]] must be apportioned according to the state populations, were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spaulding|first1=Matthew|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Slave Trade|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/130/prohibition-on-amendment-slave-trade|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Article V also shields the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Composition.3B Election of Senators|first]] clause of Article I, Section 3, which provides for equal representation of the states in the [[United States Senate]], from being amended, though not absolutely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph  Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted to require unanimous ratification of any amendment altering the composition of the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Chico State Inside: [http://www.csuchico.edu/pub/inside/06_11_09/gibson.shtml Alan Gibson, "It Is Broken, but No One Wants to Fix It: A Call for Reform of the United States Constitution"], accessed July 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text of the clause would indicate that the size of the Senate could be changed by an ordinary amendment if each state continued to have equal representation.

==Company law==
Provisions may also be entrenched in the constitutions of corporate bodies. An example is in the memoranda and articles of a [[company limited by guarantee]], in which the principles of [[common ownership]] may be entrenched. This practice can make it almost impossible for the company's members to dissolve the company and distribute its assets amongst them. This idea has more recently been extended in the UK through the invention of the [[community interest company]] (CIC) which incorporates an [[asset lock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004]], part 2&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies in the UK may make provision for entrenchment of certain articles so that, for example, the specified articles may only be amended or repealed by agreement of all the members of the company or by a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies Act 2006]], section 22&lt;/ref&gt; In India there is similar provision in section 5 of the [[Companies Act 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corporate-cases.com/2013/04/provisions-of-entrenchment-in-articles.html Provisions for Entrenchment in Articles of Association], accessed 20 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eternity clause''' in the [[constitution]] or [[basic law]] of a country is a clause intended to ensure that the law or constitution cannot be changed by amendment. Eternity clauses are a type of [[entrenched clause]] in the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]],&lt;ref name=CECEE/&gt; [[Constitution of Germany|Germany]], [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey]], [[Constitution of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008], Article 110 §1, p. 124, source: Hellenic Parliament, "The provisions of the Constitution shall be subject to revision with the exception of those which determine the form of government as a Parliamentary Republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 , 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, 13 paragraph 1, and 26."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name=weakcon&gt;{{cite book|title=Weak Constitutionalism: Democratic Legitimacy and the Question of Constituent Power (Routledge Research in Constitutional Law|author=Joel Colón-Ríos|isbn=978-0415671903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqqQAzH2zxEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ac5BHQMPUf&amp;sig=W94bSY1hO-OioXESL7MR08Hp_gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2012|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Morocco|Morocco]],&lt;ref name=EWC/&gt; [[Constitution of Iran|the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [[Constitution of Brazil|the Federative Republic of Brazil]] and [[Constitution of Norway|Norway]].&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] and the [[Constitution of Colombia]] contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

==Brazil==
Article 60 paragraph 4th of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Federal form of the state; 
# direct, secret universal and periodic voting; 
# separation of powers; and 
# individual rights and guarantees.

There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

==Czech Republic==
The [[Czech Constitution]] contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the [[Czech constitutional court]] assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of [[European law]] on the constitution.&lt;ref name=CECEE&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional Evolution in Central and Eastern Europe (Studies in Modern Law and Policy) |author=Kyriaki Topidi and Alexander H.E. Morawa|isbn=978-1409403272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhLKZKm7zGgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6I3qdcCgv7&amp;sig=-N5b6wCU8dqfjiKGSAe1xWgxBmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2010|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German eternity clause (German: ''Ewigkeitsklausel'') is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (German: ''Grundgesetz''). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of [[Germany]]'s democracy can never be removed, even by [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304634/defending-german-democracy-andrew-stuttaford|title=Defending German Democracy|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental principles, (i.e., "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 1;
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Rule of law''' (Rechtsstaat): "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." Art. 20 Para. (3);
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." Art. 20 Paras. (2) and (3).

The ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new "legal" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="iiea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiea.com/publications/challenges-to-the-esm-treaty-and-the-fiscal-compact-treaty-before-the-german-constitutional-court|title=The Euro Crisis: Challenges to the ESM Treaty and the Fiscal Compact Treaty before the German Constitutional Court|publisher=[[Institute of International and European Affairs]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate "the basic principles" of "this Basic Law" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires "a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People."&lt;ref name="iiea" /&gt;  So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the [[Weimar Constitution]], which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of "all state authority" regarding "human rights" (that is, "the basic rights" guaranteed in "this Basic Law") and have established specific [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] organs in "the constitutional order" of "this Basic Law", each with separate functions bound by the [[law]]. These are "the basic principles" of the [[rule of law|democratic rule of law]] (German: ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and the [[separation of powers]], which are principles endorsed by three [[United Nations resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml|title=United Nations and the Rule of Law |publisher=Un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2018}}

==Greece==
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]]. This article states that every article of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] can be revised by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], except of the fundemental ones, which establish [[Greece]] as a [[parliamentary republic]] and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=Constitution of Greece in English|publisher= [[Hellenic Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These fundamental articles include:

* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 1 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people, exist for the perople and the nation and are exercised as the Constitution suggests." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 2 Para. (1);
* '''Rule of law''': "Every Greek is equal to the law." Art. 4 Para. (1);
* '''About Public Function''': "Only Greek citizens are acceptable to all public functions, except of the exceptions in special laws." Art. 4 Para (4);
* '''About nobility titles''': "Noble or excellence titles are not given and not reconised on Greek citizens." Art. 4 Para (7);
* '''Acknowledgement of free personality''': "All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages." Art. 5 Para (1);
* '''Personal Liberty''': "Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides." Art. 5 Para. (3);
* '''Freedom of Religion''': "Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual’s religious beliefs." Art. 13 Para. (1)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," Art. 26;

==India==
The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has developed the [[basic structure doctrine]] which holds that certain features of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.

==Iran==
The final Article of the [[Constitution of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution_ch13.php The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in [[Australia]] is allowed in practice and protected to varying degrees through the constitution and legislation at the [[Government of Australia|Federal]], [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Completed_Inquiries/jfadt/Religion/issues|title=Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Freedom of Religion and Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/submissions/religious-freedom-review-2018|title=Religious Freedom Review (2018)|last=ahrc.admin|first=|date=2018-02-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a [[Secular state|secular country]] with legislated [[separation of church and state]] and with no [[state religion]]. The nation has over 13.5 million people who identify as religious and 7.1 million who identify as [[Irreligion in Australia|irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1266.02016?OpenDocument#Data|title=2016 Census - Cultural Diversity|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|first=|date=|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant legislation protecting religious freedoms include sections of the [[Constitution of Australia]], Federal anti-[[discrimination]] laws and State/Territory-based human rights acts and anti-discrimination laws. As these freedoms are not protected in a single piece of legislation, but rather appear as sections, clauses and exemptions in other acts or laws, legal religious freedom protections are often a source of great debate and difficult to discern in Australia.

== Religious freedom laws ==

=== Federal level ===
The [[Constitution of Australia]] prohibits the Commonwealth from establishing laws which create, force or prohibit any religion. It also restricts the Commonwealth from using religion as a qualifier or test in order to hold public office. [[Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 116]] of ''Chapter V. The States'' in the [[Australian Constitution]] reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/chapter5|title=Chapter V. The States.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The section is based on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The article does not prohibit the [[States and territories of Australia|States of Australia]] from implementing such laws, meaning legislation at the state level could provide for restriction or enforcement of religion.

=== State and Territory level ===
Two [[referendum]]s were held on whether to restrict the ability of states to legislate laws that may impede religious freedoms: the [[Australian Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights referendum, 1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988]]. Both failed to achieve a majority of support amongst the states and therefore did not pass into law. In theory, Australian State and Territory Governments can therefore pass laws impeding religious freedoms.

Some states and territories have implemented a bill or charter of rights which include freedom and protection for religion, such as ''Section 14: Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief'' in:

* ''[[Human Rights Act 2004]]'' ([[Australian Capital Territory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/act/consol_act/hra2004148/|title=HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 2004|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities|''Charter of Human Rights &amp; Responsibilities Act 2006'']] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cohrara2006433/|title=CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT 2006|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These legislated acts are based on the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], to which Australia was a signatory in 1966 despite no direct legislation to permit these freedoms. These acts do not prevent the passing of laws that impede any rights mentioned (including religious freedoms), but they do create a process by which all legislation must be scrutinised for human rights implications, and must be accompanied by a statement of compatibility with human rights before they can be passed by the relevant Parliament. In cases where the legislation is not compatible, it may still be passed despite contradicting these human rights acts.

== Anti-discrimination laws ==
Anti-discrimination laws addressing unfair treatment on the basis of a range of attributes, including religion, also apply at the state and federal level. These laws contribute to religious freedoms by allowing Australians to practice religion without fear of consequence from the executive, organisations or individuals. This is achieved by prohibiting detrimental treatment as a result of an individual's religious appearance, beliefs or observances. Some argue these laws are inconsistent at the state level and may be limited at the federal level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal level ===
The ''[[Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986]]'' defines discrimination as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''(a)  any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, '''religion''', political opinion, national extraction or social origin that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation;''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00143|title=Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986|last=AG|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== State and Territory level ===
State and Territory legislation prohibits unfavourable treatment on the basis of an individual's personal characteristics, but to varying degrees and with varying detail.

Personal characteristics includes religious beliefs or activities in anti-discrimination legislation for the majority of states, and as such these laws may be seen to support religious freedom by prohibiting unfair treatment using religion as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/religious-freedom-should-be-protected-for-all-australians-20180519-p4zgc7.html|title=Religious freedom should be protected for all Australians|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, anti-discrimination acts States where religious beliefs and activities are protected include:

*''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'' ([[Western Australia]])
*''Discrimination Act 1991'' (Australian Capital Territory)
*''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1991]]'' ([[Queensland]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1996'' ([[Northern Territory]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1998'' ([[Tasmania]])
*''[[Equal Opportunity Act 2010]]'' (Victoria)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/quick-guide-australian-discrimination-laws|title=A quick guide to Australian discrimination laws|last=Kwan|first=Connie|date=2015-02-11|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other state acts apply narrower protection to '[[Religious clothing|religious appearance or dress]]' (''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'', [[South Australia]]) and '[[Ethnoreligious group|Ethno-religious]] or [[Nationality|national origin]]' (''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]]'', [[New South Wales]]). It has been suggested that both states update their laws in order to align to the rest of the States and Territories.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vac.org.au/site/assets/uploaded/9dcc87b5-vac_religious_freedom_review_final.pdf|title=Submission to the Religious Freedom Review|last=Victorian Aids Council|first=|date=|website=vac.org.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious exemptions ===
General religious exception or exemption clauses exist within the various federal and state human rights acts with the aim to ensuring religious activities or observances are not impacted or inhibited by the protections provided by each act. These exemptions therefore protect freedom of religion by permitting what would otherwise be considered discrimination if it is in the context of "an act or practice of a body established for religious purposes that conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that religion or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/FOI/Documents/Commonwealth%20Anti-Discrimination%20Legislation.pdf|title=List of Exemptions in Commonwealth Anti-Discrimination Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Attorney General of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the ''Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986'', for example, an exemption is provided:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Discrimination ... does not include any distinction, exclusion or preference:''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; ''(d)  in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion or preference made in good faith '''in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed.'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Varying groups have argued that existing religious exceptions and exemptions go too far and impede the rights of individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/yes-victors-seek-abolition-of-all-church-exemptions-to-anti-discrimination-laws-20180214-p4z0aj.html|title='Yes' victors seek abolition of all church exemptions to anti-discrimination laws|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-02-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others argue the correct balance has been struck,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/07/labor-has-no-plans-to-change-law-allowing-religious-schools-to-fire-gay-teachers|title=Labor has 'no plans' to change law allowing religious schools to fire gay teachers|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-01-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet others petition for wider-reaching religious exemption clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acl.org.au/acl-contributes-to-the-australian-human-rights-commissions-religious-freedom-roundtable|title=ACL contributes to the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Religious Freedom Roundtable|work=Australian Christian Lobby|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgements and interpretations ==
{{See also|Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia}}
[[File:Court 2 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|Court 2 of the High Court of Australia, [[Canberra]]. The High Court has issued few judgements in direct relation to freedom of religion]]
There have been few tests involving religious freedom put before the [[High Court of Australia]]. Judgements from the Court are generally considered to interpret the primary piece of legislation relating to religious freedom, Section 116, narrowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treading on Sacred Grounds: Places of Worship, Local Planning and Religious Freedom in Australia|last=Villaroman|first=Noel|publisher=Brill Nijhoff|year=2015|isbn=978-90-04-28933-8|edition=12|location=Boston|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) ===
In the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)'', the court was primarily concerned with whether [[Scientology]] was a religion (and therefore deserved [[tax exemption]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t status). In judgement, the Court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion and argued that the definition of religion must be flexible, but also remain sceptical of false claims. Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] set out five "[[wikt:indicia|indicia]]" of a religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) That the collection of ideas and practices involved a belief in the supernatural (being something that could not be perceived by the senses); (ii) That 'the ideas relate to man's nature and place in the universe and his relation to things supernatural' ; (iii) That the adherents accept certain ideas as requiring them or encouraging them to observe particular codes of conduct or specific practices having some supernatural significance; (iv) The adherents themselves form an identifiable group or groups; (v) The adherents themselves see the collection of ideas, beliefs and practices as constituting a religion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jade.io/article/67076|title=CHURCH OF THE NEW FAITH v. COMMISSIONER OF PAY-ROLL TAX (VICT.) 1983, 154 CLR 120|last=HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA|first=|date=27 October 1983|website=Jade|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this judgement Section 116 was interpreted more broadly than in previous cases. The justices argued that Section 116 provides fundamental guarantees to freedom of religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of the law towards complete religious liberty and religious equality... would be subverted and the guarantees in s. 116 of the Constitution would lose their character as a bastion of freedom if religion were so defined as to exclude from its ambit minority religions out of the main streams of religious thought.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Adelaide Co of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth ===
{{See also|Adelaide Co of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth}}
In the 1941 the Commonwealth Government declared [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be a risk to national security, indicating they were believed to be "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth" and the "efficient prosecution of the [[World War II|war]]" due to their following ideals of another Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/legislating-religious-freedom-will-be-a-minefield-for-morrison-20181002-p50798.html|title=Legislating religious freedom will be a minefield for Morrison|last=Hull|first=Crispin|date=2018-10-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police occupied premises of the religious group, prompting a lawsuit heard by the High Court in which Jehovah's Witnesses argued their rights granted under Section 116 of the Constitution were infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lawandreligionaustralia.blog/tag/jehovahs-witness-case/|title=Jehovah’s Witness case – Law and Religion Australia|website=lawandreligionaustralia.blog|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held that the ''National Security (Subversive Organisations) Regulations'' 1940, under which the Government had taken action, did not infringe against Section 116, but that the government had exceeded their "defence power" in [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|section 51(vi)]] of the Constitution.

== Criticism and status quo ==

The absence of a Federal [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] (or Human Rights Act) which provide a guarantee of religious and other freedoms in almost all other western democracies, has been noted as a primary failure to solidify the current ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' rights to freedom of religion in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/comment-australia-needs-a-bill-of-rights|title=Comment: Australia needs a Bill of Rights|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has criticised the lack of protections for religious freedom alongside other ''de facto'' freedoms and has recommended the introduction of a Bill of Rights to formally protect the rights of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/freedom-thought-conscience-and-religion-or-belief|title=Freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief|last=David.Mason|date=2013-05-01|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have highlighted that religion and religious freedoms are already well-protected, including with exemptions to anti-discrimination legislation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Frequently highlighted examples include [[religious school]]s having rights not extended to other institutions, including the ability to fire teachers who do not align with the institution's religious beliefs for any reason. This occurred in the case of the Perth South Coast Baptist College and teacher Craig Campbell who was sacked for coming out as homosexual in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/mocked-in-class-this-teacher-revealed-he-was-gay-he-lost-his-job/news-story/c1209c28127019613da5cc7ddfe4d700|title=Perth teacher loses his job after telling school he is gay|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ruddock Review ==
[[File:Philip Ruddock.jpg|left|thumb|Philip Ruddock, chair of the Religious Freedom Review]]

=== Report commission ===
Following the passage of [[same-sex marriage]] [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|legislation in Australia]] in 2017, a federal review was commissioned by the [[Second Turnbull Ministry|Turnbull Government]] to examine the suitability of current religious freedom protections, specifically within the context of the new [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmc.gov.au/domestic-policy/religious-freedom-review|title=Religious Freedom Review|last=Cabinet|first=Prime Minister and|date=2017-12-12|website=www.pmc.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Religious Freedom Review was chaired by [[Philip Ruddock]], the former [[Attorney-General for Australia]] at the time same-sex marriage was [[Marriage Amendment Act 2004|banned]] by the [[Third Howard Ministry|Howard Government]] in 2004, and had no associated terms of reference.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/ruddock-review-next-big-battle-for-gay-community-lgbtiq-council-chair-says-20171208-h01e6t.html|title=Ruddock review next big battle for gay community, LGBTIQ council chair says|last=Burgess|first=Katie|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review panel was composed of Ruddock alongside [[Jesuit]] priest [[Frank Brennan (priest)|Frank Brennan]], former judge [[Annabelle Bennett]], Human Rights Commission president [[Ros Croucher]] and constitutional lawyer Nicholas Aroney. The expert review panel first met on 10 January 2018, and on 18 May the final review was handed to the Turnbull Government. The Government has declined to release the review in full pending cabinet discussion on its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruddock review has been interpreted as a way to allow the speedy passage of Dean Smith's marriage bill and to postpone discussions of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Michael|title=Philip Ruddock review into religious freedom fails to deter conservative MPs from attack on marriage bill|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/philip-ruddock-review-into-religious-freedom-fails-to-deter-conservative-mps-from-attack-on-marriage-bill-20171122-gzqbt2.html|accessdate=11 March 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Ruddock Review argue it is necessary to ensure that religious freedoms are upheld in the wake of religious objection to same-sex marriage, whilst opponents highlight that further protections for religion are not necessary and will occur at the expense of an individual's right to be free from discrimination (particularly in the case of same-sex marriages).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/don-t-change-discrimination-laws-architect-tells-religious-freedom-review-20180330-p4z74c.html|title=Don't change discrimination laws, architect tells religious freedom review|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-03-30|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as the [[Victorian Aids Council]] and Australian Human Rights Commission have argued that a comprehensive Bill of Rights -rather than an exclusive religious freedoms law- should be implemented as this would also give full effect to Australia's obligations and commitments under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] by enshrining all fundamental rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Government response ===
Turnbull's government indicated it would not release the report received in May 2018 until it had been considered in full by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, his replacement [[Scott Morrison]] indicated his government would not release the report or form a full response to it before the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] and [[Kerryn Phelps]] given the timing of the [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|Wentworth by-election]], as voters would not have an understanding of any changes to religious law potentially instituted by Australia's first [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/04/michael-kirby-attacks-coalition-for-failure-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-report|title=Michael Kirby attacks Coalition for failure to release Ruddock religious freedom report|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/26/kerryn-phelps-urges-pm-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-review-before-byelection|title=Kerryn Phelps urges PM to release Ruddock religious freedom review before byelection|last=Murphy|first=Katharine|date=2018-09-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite a senate motion ordering its release ahead of the by-election, the government refused to comply, claiming that a release would "harm the public interest" and interfere in cabinet consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/release-religious-freedom-report-senators|title=Release religious freedom report: senators|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outinperth.com/morrison-government-refuses-release-religious-freedom-report/|title=Morrison government refuses to release religious freedom report {{!}} OUTInPerth – LGBTIQ News and Culture|website=www.outinperth.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] suggested in an [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] interview that the Ruddock review had recommended that people of different religions have the same protections as other attributes such as gender and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaks and media coverage ===
On 9 October 2018, extracts of the review were leaked to [[Fairfax Media]], which reported that schools affiliated with a religion "would be guaranteed the right to turn away gay students and teachers under changes to federal anti-discrimination laws" recommended by the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Topsfield |first1=Jewel |title=Religious freedom review enshrines right of schools to turn away gay children and teachers |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/religious-freedom-review-enshrines-right-of-schools-to-turn-away-gay-children-and-teachers-20181009-p508o7.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister initially defended this, but stated that the media coverage of the leaked report was "confused".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/gay-students-could-be-rejected-by-religious-schools-under-new-laws-report-claims|title=Gay students could be rejected by religious schools under new laws, report claims|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|date=9 October 2018|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools have held the right to discriminate against teachers and students on the basis of their gender or sexual orientation since 2013, however the Ruddock report recommended that schools additionally be required to hold a publicly-available policy and put the best interests of the child first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/ruddock-report-constrains-not-expands-federal-religious-exemptions-96347|title=Ruddock report constrains, not expands, federal religious exemptions|last1=Elphick|first1=Liam|last2=Maguire|first2=Amy|date=11 October 2018|website=The Conversation|language=en|accessdate=12 October 2018|last3=Hilkemeijer|first3=Anja}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following further media coverage and public pressure, the Labor opposition announced their support would be lent to the government should it seek to repeal the discrimination law exemptions already in existence which allow religious schools to ban students based on their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/12/labor-offers-support-if-morrison-acts-to-stop-schools-from-expelling-gay-students|title=Labor offers support if Morrison acts to stop schools from expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Morrison Government]] subsequently agreed to introduce a bill to parliament with that aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/13/morrison-caves-to-labor-on-gay-students-in-discrimination-law-reform-push|title=Scott Morrison will change the law to ban religious schools expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/bipartisan-backflip-on-queer-bigotry-20181013-p509hr.html|title=Bipartisan backflip on queer bigotry|date=2018-10-13|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Greens]] and Labor opposition have further committed to revoking discrimination exemptions that also allow discrimination against teachers based on their sexual orientation, however the government has so far not indicated its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/protect-gay-teachers-now-labor|title=Protect gay teachers now: Labor|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;[emphasis in original]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Errol Denton, a [[live blood analysis]] practitioner, was charged with offences under the [[Cancer Act 1939]]. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, he used a freeman defence.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
The '''Golden Rule''' is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] that is found in many religions and [[culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}} This dictionary of philosophy contains the following quote under the entry for "golden rule": "The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

Various expressions of the rule exist in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability." (end quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule was much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. Instead, he posits, it "express[es] the essence of a universal [[morality]]." The rationale for this crucial distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). See:
 {{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can be considered an '''ethic of reciprocity''' in some [[religion]]s, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative [[injunction]] governing conduct:

* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
* One should ''not'' treat others in ways that one would ''not'' like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;
* What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;

The idea dates at least to the early [[Confucian]] times (551–479 BCE) according to [[Rushworth Kidder]], who identifies that this concept appears prominently in [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]],  [[Zoroastrianism]], and "the rest of the world's major religions".&lt;ref name="W.A. Spooner 1914 pp. 310"&gt;W.A. Spooner, "The Golden Rule," in James Hastings, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'', Vol. 6 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1914) pp. 310–12, quoted in Rushworth M. Kidder, ''How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living'', Harper, New York, 2003. {{ISBN|0-688-17590-2}}. p. 159.

== Ancient history ==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Possibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], appears in the story of [[The Eloquent Peasant]], which dates to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040–1650 BC): "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "Now this is the command: do to the doer to make him do"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Albert Wilson p. 121"&gt;''"The Culture of Ancient Egypt"'', John Albert Wilson, p. 121, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1956, {{ISBN|0-226-90152-1}} "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to cause that he do"&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb embodies the ''[[do ut des]]'' principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "The peasant quotes a proverb that embodies the do ut des principle"&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: "That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another."&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc52.pdf A Late Period Hieratic Wisdom Text: P. Brooklyn 47.218.135"]'', Richard Jasnow, p. 95, University of Chicago Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-918986-85-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient India ===

==== Sanskrit tradition ====
In ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'', the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira
{{quote|Listening to wise scriptures, austerity, sacrifice, respectful faith, social welfare, forgiveness, purity of intent, compassion, truth and self-control—are the ten wealth of character (self). O king aim for these, may you be steadfast in these qualities. These are the basis of prosperity and rightful living. These are highest attainable things. All worlds are balanced on ''dharma'', ''dharma'' encompasses ways to prosperity as well. O King, ''dharma'' is the best quality to have, wealth the medium and desire (''kāma'') the lowest. Hence, (keeping these in mind), by self-control and by making ''dharma'' (right conduct) your main focus, treat others as you treat yourself.| ''Mahābhārata Shānti-Parva'' 167:9}}

==== Tamil tradition ====
In Chapter 32 in the [[Aram (Kural book)|Part on Virtue]] of the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), [[Tiruvalluvar]] says: "Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself" (K. 316.); "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)

=== Ancient Greece ===
The Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Examples of the general concept include:
* "Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing."&amp;nbsp;– [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers", I:36&lt;/ref&gt;  (c. 624 BC – c. 546 BC)

A rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ואהבת לרעך כמוך}}):
{{quote|You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}}}

[[Hillel the Elder]] (c. 110 BC – 10 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=730&amp;letter=H Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel]: "His activity of forty years is perhaps historical; and since it began, according to a trustworthy tradition (Shab. 15a), one hundred years before the destruction of Jerusalem, it must have covered the period 30 BC–10 AD&lt;!--B.C. in the original--&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; used this verse as a most important message of the [[Torah]] for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for [[conversion to Judaism]] but, drawing on {{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}, briefed the man:
{{quote|What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.|{{sourcetext|source=Babylonian Talmud|version=|book=Shabbath|chapter=folio|verse=31a}}|[[Babylonian Talmud]]}}

Hillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. [[Rabbi Akiva]] agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God ([[Sifra]], Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; [[Genesis Rabba]] 24).&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; According to [[Adam in rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]], the first man [[Adam]] represents the ''unity of mankind''. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Preamble|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4?lang=en|title=Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 4.5|publisher=sefaria.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toseftaonline.org/Tractate-Sanhedrin-chapter-8-tosefta-4|title=Tosefta on Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 8.4–9 (Erfurt Manuscript)|publisher=toseftaonline.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=758&amp;letter=A&amp;search=adam#1 |title=ADAM |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jewish Publication Society's edition of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Torah|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|page=19:17|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/jps/lev019.htm|chapter=Leviticus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the ''Golden Rule'', which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.&lt;ref name="Plaut p. 892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;– A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:

{{quote|The [[Ger toshav|stranger who resides with you]] shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I the LORD am your God.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:34|JP}}}}

Commentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.

On the verse, "Love your fellow as yourself," the classic commentator [[Rashi]] quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: "Love your fellow as yourself&amp;nbsp;– Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;Kedoshim 19:18, Toras Kohanim, ibid. See also Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4; Bereishis Rabbah 24:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christianity ====
{{See also|Christian ethics|Great Commandment}}
[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Jesus]] taught the Golden Rule during the [[Sermon on the Mount]].]]
The "Golden Rule" was given by [[Jesus of Nazareth]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A12&amp;version=NCV Matthew 7:12 NCV], see also [[s:Bible (King James)/Luke#6:31|Luke 6:31]]). The common English phrasing is "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic [[catechism]] around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the first Table be three Commandments: which take away and forbid sin and vice against the worshipping of God. They forbid idolatry, apostasy, heresy, superstition, perjury, blasphemy, and move us to the pure and true worshipping of God in heart, word and deed. In the Second table be seven Commandments, which command us to give reverence and honor to every man in his degree, to profit all, and hurt none: to do unto others, as we would be done to ourselves.")

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the [[Old Testament]]:  {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}} ("Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD."; see also [[Great Commandment]]) and {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=34}} ("But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.").

The [[Old Testament]] [[Deuterocanonical]] books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Sirach]], accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:

{{quote|"Do to no one what you yourself dislike."|Tobit 4:15}}
{{quote|"Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own dislikes."|Sirach 31:15}}

Two passages in the [[New Testament]] quote [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:

[[Matthew 7:12]]
{{quote|Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.}}

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=6|verse=31}}
{{quote|Do to others what you would want them to do to you.}}

A similar passage, a parallel to the [[Great Commandment]], is {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=New International Readers Version|book=Luke|chapter=10|verse=25|range=-28}}

{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?"
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.’(Deuteronomy 6:5) And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ "
&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".}}

The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, "Who is my neighbor?", by telling the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]], indicating that "your neighbor" is anyone in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?b=42&amp;c=10&amp;com=wes |title=John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on Luke 10 |publisher=Christnotes.org |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.

Jesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.&lt;ref&gt;Moore: Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era; Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927–1930; Vol. 2, p. 87, Vol. 3, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one passage of the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to the golden rule:

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Galatians|chapter=5|verse=14 | Galatians 5:14 }}
{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.}}

==== Islam ====
{{See also|Islamic ethics}}

The Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam.  "Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance"{{according to whom|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

However, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:
{{quote|Fakir al-Din al-Razi and several other Qur'anic commentators have pointed out that Qur'an 83:1-6 is an implicit statement of the Golden Rule, which is explicitly stated in the tradition, "Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

{{quote|Similar examples of the golden rule are found in the hadith of the prophet Muhammad.

==== Jainism ====
{{See also|Jainism|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

The Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]] and [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]]. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.

The following quotation from the [[Acaranga Sutra]] sums up the philosophy of Jainism:
{{Quote|Nothing which breathes, which exists, which lives, or which has essence or potential of life, should be destroyed or ruled over, or subjugated, or harmed, or denied of its essence or potential.

In support of this Truth, I ask you a question – ''"Is sorrow or pain desirable to you ?"'' If you say ''"yes it is"'', it would be a lie. If you say, ''"No, It is not"'' you will be expressing the truth. '''Just as sorrow or pain is not desirable to you, so it is to all which breathe, exist, live or have any essence of life.''' To you and all, it is undesirable, and painful, and repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | title =Ācāranga Sūtra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22. | year= 1884 | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm}} Sutra 155–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the ''[[Analects]]'' (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online [[Chinese Text Project]]. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.

And although it isn’t possible to know what it really feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and have different life experiences, it isn’t difficult for most of us to imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering to others. For this reason many people find the Golden Rule’s corollary&amp;nbsp;– "do not treat people in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself"&amp;nbsp;– more pragmatic.&lt;ref name="Thinkhumanism.com" /&gt;|sign=Maria MacLachlan|source=Think Humanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkhumanism.com/ |title=Think Humanism |publisher=Think Humanism |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you. ''[is] (…)'' the single greatest, simplest, and most important moral axiom humanity has ever invented, one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture and religion throughout history, the one we know as the Golden Rule.

Moral directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile, and in fact, it is precisely this rule's simplicity which makes it great. It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it. It is the basic and fundamental human trait of empathy, the ability to vicariously experience how another is feeling, that makes this possible, and it is the principle of empathy by which we should live our lives.|sign=Adam Lee|source=Ebon Musings, "A decalogue for the modern world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/new10c.html |title=A decalogue for the modern world |publisher=Ebonmusings.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Other contexts ==

=== Human rights ===
According to [[Marc H. Bornstein]], and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of [[human rights]], in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.&lt;ref&gt;Defined another way, it "''refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one's rights are the other's obligation.''"{{cite book|last=Bornstein |first=Marc H.|title=Handbook of Parenting|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2002|page=5|isbn=978-0-8058-3782-7}} See also: {{cite book|last=Paden |first=William E.|title=Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2003|pages=131–132|isbn=978-0-8070-7705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Leo Damrosch]] argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to "rights" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human "rights" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to "inalienable rights" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Science and economics ==
{{further information|Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocal altruism}}

There has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] and [[Neuroethics|neuroethical]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, Donald W., "The Neuroscience of Fair Play: Why We (Usually) Follow the Golden Rule", Dana Press, The Dana Foundation, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-932594-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as "I" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologically, "love your neighbor as yourself" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.  In evolution, "[[reciprocal altruism]]" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel| first1=Gretchen|title=The Evolution of the Golden Rule|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=Feb 2004|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Golden Rule#Economics|economics]], Richard Swift, referring to ideas from [[David Graeber]], suggests that "without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Richard|title=Pathways &amp; possibilites|journal=New Internationalist|volume=484|issue=July/August 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Philosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/the_golden_rule.html |title=Only a Game: The Golden Rule |publisher=Onlyagame.typepad.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.

=== Differences in values or interests ===
[[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote, "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|title=Man and Superman|date=1903|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.|page=227|url=https://archive.org/stream/mansupermancomed00shawrich#page/226/mode/2up|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of "do unto others" is "dangerous in the wrong hands,"&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', [[Iain King]], 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to philosopher [[Iain King]], because "some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in situations ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others.&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Kant, Immanuel ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', footnote 13. Cambridge University Press (28 April 1998). {{ISBN|978-0-521-62695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ''[[Categorical imperative|Categorical Imperative]]'', introduced in ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', is often [[Categorical imperative#The Golden Rule|confused with the Golden Rule.]]

=== Cannot be a sole guide to action ===
In his book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] has argued that "(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 110 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be "incendiary",&lt;ref name="Source 2008"&gt;Source: p. 112 of ''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; since it "can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity," unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Source 2008" /&gt; Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 114 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.

=== Responses to criticisms&lt;!--linked from [[The Platinum Rule]]; [[Platinum Rule (principle)]] redirects here--&gt; ===
[[Walter Terence Stace]], in ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937), wrote:

{{quote|Mr. Bernard Shaw's remark "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different" is no doubt a smart saying. But it seems to overlook the fact that "doing as you would be done by" includes taking into account your neighbor's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account. Thus the "golden rule" might still express the essence of a universal morality ''even if no two men in the world had any needs or tastes in common''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Marcus George Singer]] observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1)&amp;nbsp;that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2)&amp;nbsp;that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.

In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;Wattles, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Jouni Reinikainen, "The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability." Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155–168, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of "doing unto others, wherever possible, as ''they'' would be done by..." has sometimes been termed the [[platinum rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Vol. 2 (1966 [1945]), p. 386. Dubbed "the platinum rule" in business books such as Charles J. Jacobus, Thomas E. Gillett, ''Georgia Real Estate: An Introduction to the Profession'', Cengage Learning, 2007, p. 409 and Jeremy Comfort, Peter Franklin, ''The Mindful International Manager: How to Work Effectively Across Cultures'', Kogan Page, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">The '''Harrison Tweed Award''' was created in 1956 to recognize the extraordinary achievements of state and local bar associations that develop or significantly expand projects or programs to increase access to civil legal services for poor persons or criminal defense services for indigents. This award is given annually by the [[American Bar Association]]'s (ABA) Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants and the [[National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association]], is presented during the ABA Annual Meeting at a joint luncheon of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, National Association of Bar Executives and National Conference of Bar Foundations. The award is named for [[Harrison Tweed]], past president of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].

1953 • [[Governor of New York|New York State Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]], and the state legislature formed the temporary Tweed Commission (named after its chair, lawyer Harrison Tweed) to conduct public and private hearings regarding the post-[[World War II]] court situation; such as overall caseload volumes that had grown to the point where court delay was becoming a major problem and procedural reform was necessary.

1955 • The Legislature created the Judicial Conference to allow for periodic meetings of judges to discuss problems and established the Office of State Administrator; their functions were merely advisory but allowed the permanent examination of court operations.

1958 • The Tweed Commission Report proposed reform through centralization of court administration, simplification of court structure, and continued supervision of the courts by the Judicial Conference and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]].

1962 • A new Judiciary Article for the [[Constitution of New York|State Constitution]], implementing many of the Tweed Commission recommendations, was approved by the Legislature and the voters; this article created the "Unified Court System," established the various trial courts, established the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference (the Chief Judge of the Court of the Appellate Division), and conferred on the Appellate Divisions various administrative powers.

'''NOTE''': Tweed fellow family members included [[Simeon Eben Baldwin]], [[Governor of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] and cofounder, American Bar Association; and [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], cofounder and the first executive director, American Civil Liberties Union ([[ACLU]]).

The '''indeterminacy debate in legal theory''' can be summed up as follows: Can the law constrain the results reached by adjudicators in legal disputes? Some members of the [[critical legal studies]] movement — primarily [[jurist|legal academics]] in the [[United States]] — argued that the answer to this question is "no." Another way to state this position is to suggest that disputes cannot be resolved with clear answers and thus there is at least some amount of uncertainty in legal reasoning and its application to disputes. A given body of legal doctrine is said to be "indeterminate" by demonstrating that every legal rule in that body of legal doctrine is opposed by a counterrule that can be used in a process of legal reasoning.

The ''indeterminacy thesis'' emerged as a far-left reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s "right answer" thesis. In its strongest form it is an extreme version of [[legal realism]]. It argues that nothing is law until it has been promulgated by an official - either a judge or the legislature. For example, a statute that says "No person may smoke in a hospital" does not mean that "John Doe may not smoke in a hospital"; the second statement is the law only if a legitimate authority declares so.

This is because one cannot describe a legal statement as right or wrong without making a normative value judgment about what the law should be.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

In the 1990s the indeterminacy thesis came under heavy attack by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] defenders of the [[rule of law]], and the debate, though its mantle is in the process of being taken up by a new generation of scholars, has left the intellectual spotlight for the time being.

The thesis can be criticised because the concept of legal mistake is recognised in a determinative theory of law. While such a mistake necessarily involves a normative judgment, it is not truly subjective. A positivist Hartian theory contends that this judgment is conventionally objective because the rule of recognition fails to recognise the mistake as legally valid. According to a liberal theory such as Dworkin's, the normativity of the judgment is one of reason rather than of value.

'''Intestacy''' is the condition of the [[estate (law)|estate]] of a person who dies without having made a valid [[Will and testament|will]] or other binding declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intestacy|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intestacy|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively this may also apply where a will or declaration has been made, but only applies to part of the estate; the remaining estate forms the "intestate estate". Intestacy law, also referred to as the '''law of descent and distribution''', refers to the body of law ([[Statute|statutory]] and [[case law]]) that determines who is entitled to the property from the estate under the rules of [[inheritance]].

==History and the common law==
Intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or [[Roman law]] because the concept of a will is itself less important; the doctrine of [[forced heirship]] automatically gives a deceased person's [[next-of-kin]] title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate's property [[by operation of law]], beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift. A forced share (or [[legitime]]) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the forced [[heir]]. In matters of cross-border inheritance, the "laws of succession" is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and [[Sharia law]] jurisdictions.
After the [[Statute of Wills]] 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and [[real property]] by a ''will''. Their [[personal property]] could formerly be disposed of by a ''testament'', hence the hallowed legal [[merism]] ''last will and testament''.

Common law sharply distinguished between [[real property]] and [[Personal property|chattel]]s. Real property for which no disposition had been made by will passed by the law of [[kinship and descent]]; chattel property for which no disposition had been made by testament was [[escheat]] to [[the Crown]], or given to the Church for charitable purposes. This law became obsolete as England moved from being a [[feudal]] to a [[mercantile]] society, and chattels more valuable than land were being accumulated by townspeople.

==Rules==
Where a person dies without leaving a will, the rules of succession of the person's place of [[habitual residence]] or of their [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] often apply, but it is also common for the principality where the property is located to have jurisdiction regardless of the decedent's residence or domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intestate Succession – Where does everything go without a Will?|url=http://www.curnalialaw.com/blog/pauperplanning/intestate-succession-where-does-everything-go-without-a-will/|website=Pauper Planning Techniques|publisher=Curnalia Law, LLC|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain jurisdictions such as [[France]], [[Switzerland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]], and much of the [[Islamic world]], entitlements arise whether or not there was a will. These are known as ''[[forced heir]]ship'' rights and are not typically found in [[common law]] jurisdictions, where the rules of succession without a will (intestate succession) play a back-up role where an individual has not (or has not fully) exercised his or her right to dispose of property in a will.

==Current law==
In most contemporary common-law [[jurisdiction]]s, the law of intestacy is patterned after the common law of descent. Property goes first or in major part to a spouse, then to [[child]]ren and their descendants; if there are no descendants, the rule sends you back up the family tree to the parents, the siblings, the siblings' descendants, the grandparents, the parents' siblings, and the parents' siblings' descendants, and usually so on further to the more remote degrees of kinship. The operation of these laws varies from one jurisdiction to another.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In [[England and Wales]] the Intestacy Rules have been uniform since 1925 and similar rules apply in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and [[Crown dependencies]]. These rules have been supplemented by the discretionary provisions of the [[Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975]] so that fair provision can be made for a dependent spouse or other relative where the strict divisions set down in the intestacy rules would produce an unfair result, for example by providing additional support for a dependent minor or disabled child vis-a-vis an adult child who has a career and no longer depends on their parent.

The rules of succession are the Intestacy Rules set out in the [[Administration of Estates Act]] and associated legislation. The Act sets out the order for distribution of property in the estate of the deceased. For persons with surviving children and a wealth below a certain threshold (£250,000 as from February 2009), the whole of the estate will pass to the deceased's spouse or also, from December 2005, their [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom|registered civil partner]]. For persons with no surviving children but surviving close relatives (such as siblings or parents), the first £450,000 goes to the spouse or civil partner (as from February 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Family Provision (Intestate Succession) Order 2009 (S.I. 2009 No. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; Such transfers below the threshold are exempt from UK [[inheritance tax]].

If a person dies intestate with no identifiable heirs, the person's estate generally [[escheat]]s (i.e. is legally assigned) to [[the Crown]] (via the [[Bona vacantia]] division of the [[Treasury Solicitor]]) or to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] or [[Duchy of Lancaster]] when the deceased was a resident of either; in limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application of the rules of inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Discretionary Grants in Estates Cases|url=http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/Discretionary-Grants-in-Estates-Cases.aspx|website=The Treasury Solicitor, Bona Vacantia Division|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=6 September 2017|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091003153017/http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/Discretionary-Grants-in-Estates-Cases.aspx|archivedate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For deaths after 1 October 2014, the current rules where someone dies leaving a spouse or civil partner are as follows:

* If there are no children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren then the spouse or civil partner inherits the entire estate.
*If there are children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren, the spouse receives the personal possessions and the first £250,000, then half of everything else passing under the intestacy rules. The other half passes to the children equally at 18, with provision for grandchildren whose parents have died before the intestate deceased.

In larger estates, the spouse will not receive the entire estate where the deceased left other blood relatives and left no will. They will receive the following:

*all property passing to them by survivorship (such as the deceased's share in the jointly owned family home);
*all property passing to them under the terms of a trust (such as a life insurance policy);
*a statutory legacy of a fixed sum (being a larger sum where the deceased left no children); and
*a life interest in half of the remaining estate.

The children (or more distant relatives if there are no children) of the deceased will be entitled to half of the estate remaining immediately and the remaining half on the death of the surviving spouse. Where no beneficiaries can be traced, see [[bona vacantia]].

====Scotland====
The law on intestacy in [[Scotland]] broadly follows that of England and Wales with some variations. A notable difference is that all possible (blood) relatives can qualify for benefit (i.e. they are not limited to grandparents or their descendants). Once a class is 'exhausted', succession continues to the next line of ascendants, followed by siblings, and so on. In a complete absence of relatives of the whole or half-blood, the estate passes to the Crown (as ''[[ultimus haeres]]''). The Crown has a discretion to benefit people unrelated to the intestate, e.g. those with moral claims on the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorham|first1=John|title=A Comparison of the English and Scottish Rules of Intestacy|url=http://www.trustees.org.uk/review-index/Intestacy-A-comparison-of-the-English-and-Scottish-rules-of-intestacy.php|website=The Association of Corporate Trustees|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=8 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada the laws vary from province to province. As in England, most jurisdictions apply rules of intestate succession to determine [[next of kin]] who become legal heirs to the estate. Also, as in England, if no identifiable heirs are discovered, the property may [[escheat]] to the government.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===United States===
In the United States intestacy laws vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Probate Process|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/real_property_trust_estate/resources/estate_planning/the_probate_process.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the separate states uses its own intestacy laws to determine the ownership of residents' intestate property. Attempts in the United States to make probate and intestate succession uniform from state to state, through efforts such as the [[Uniform Probate Code]], have been met with limited success.

The distribution of the property of an intestate decedent is the responsibility of the ''administrator'' (or ''personal representative'') of the estate: typically the administrator is chosen by the court having jurisdiction over the decedent's property, and is frequently (but not always) a person nominated by a majority of the decedent's heirs.

Federal law controls intestacy of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 U.S. Code § 2206 - Descent and distribution|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2206|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states have adopted all or part of the Uniform Probate Code, but often with local variations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPC Chart (Excerpted from “Record of Passage of Uniform and Model Acts, as of September 30, 2010)|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/Shared/Docs/Probate%20Code/UPC%20Chart.pdf|website=Uniform Law Commission|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ohio]], the law of intestate succession has been modified significantly from the common law, and has been essentially codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title XXI, Courts - Probate - Juvenile, Chapter 2015, Descent and Distribution|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2105|website=Ohio Revised Code|publisher=State of Ohio|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] also has codified its intestacy law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCW 11.04.015|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=11.04.015|website=Revised Code of Washington|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] has perhaps the most complicated law of descent of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Code, Estates, Powers &amp; Trusts, Sec. 4-1.1. Descent and distribution of a decedent's estate|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/4-1.1|website=The New York Senate|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eager|first1=Samuel Watkins|title=Descent and distribution : intestate succession in the state of New York|date=1926|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Co.|location=Albany, NY|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/descent-and-distribution-intestate-succession-in-the-state-of-new-york/oclc/5514327?tab=details|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida's intestacy statute permits the heirs of a deceased spouse of the decedent to inherit, in the event that the decedent has no other heirs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6620">'''Legal advice''' is the giving of a professional or formal opinion regarding the substance or procedure of the [[law]] in relation to a particular factual situation. The provision of legal advice will often involve analyzing a set of facts and advising a person to take a specific course of action based on the applicable law.&lt;ref name="calcourt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Advice vs. Legal Information|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mayihelpyou.pdf|website=Judicial Council of California|publisher=California Courts|date=2003|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eladvice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Get Free Legal Advice Online, and What to Watch Out For|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer/free_legal_advice.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal advice is ordinarily provided in exchange for financial or other tangible compensation. Advice given without remuneration is normally referred to as being ''[[pro bono|pro bono publico]]'' (in the public good), or simply ''pro bono''.

In the [[common law]] systems it is usually received from a [[solicitor]], [[barrister]] or [[lawyer]];&lt;ref name="sbmich"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unauthorized Practice of Law|url=https://www.michbar.org/file/professional/pdfs/uplfacts.pdf|website=State Bar of Michigan|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kao|first1=Frances P.|title=No, a paralegal is not a lawyer|journal=Business Law Today|date=2 January 2007|volume=16|issue=3|url=https://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/blt/2007-01-02/kao.shtml|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IS BA and the Unauthorized Practice of Law - What The Public Needs To Know|url=https://www.isba.org/sites/default/files/committees/upl/uplfaq.pdf|website=Illinois State Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems it is given by [[advocate]]s, [[lawyer]]s or other professionals (such as [[tax advisor|tax experts]], professional advisors, atc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competitive Restrictions in Legal Professions|url=https://www.oecd.org/regreform/sectors/40080343.pdf|website=OECD|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, legal advice is subject to the possession of a specific licence; in others, it is simply subject to the general regulation of [[obligation|professional obligation]] and can be provided by any person, who will usually be [[legal liability|legally responsible]] for the provided advice. The UK's [[Legal Services Act 2007]] includes the giving of legal advice within the definition of unreserved legal activities, which means that it can be provided by any person not just an officer of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roy|first1=Alex|last2=Handford|first2=Chris|title=Reserved and Unreserved Lawyers’ Activities|url=http://www.legalservicesboard.org.uk/Projects/rationalising_scope_of_regulation/pdf/reserved_and_unreserved_lawyers.pdf|website=Legal Services Board|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is provided by a lawyer or another person authorised by one of the front line legal services regulators, then this activity is included within their regulatory reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plant|first1=Charles|title=The definition of reserved legal activities should be extended|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/the-definition-of-reserved-legal-activities-should-be-extended/61811.article|accessdate=8 September 2017|agency=The Law Society Gazette|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the internet, many services have been established to provide individuals the power to conduct their own legal research or prepare their own legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Julee C.|title=Policing the Self-Help Legal Market: Consumer Protection or Protection of the Legal Cartel|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=2000|volume=34|page=121|url=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ILR/pdf/vol34p121.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, some companies offer answers to legal questions directly through their web services.&lt;ref name="eladvice"/&gt;

==Legal information==
Legal advice is distinguished from '''legal information''' which is the reiteration of legal fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hirealawyer.findlaw.com/do-you-need-a-lawyer/what-is-legal-advice.html| title=What is 'Legal Advice'?| publisher=FindLaw| accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal information can be conveyed by a parking meter, sign or by other forms of notice such as a warning by a [[police|law enforcement officer]].

Printed legal materials, such as directions and [[how-to]] manuals, are generally not considered legal advice. Accordingly, instructions on how to meet court requirements for the submission of forms and other court documents do not constitute legal advice.&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt; Thus, a non-lawyer may sell legal forms, provide general instructions for filling out the forms, and provide typing services for the entry of information into forms, provided no legal advice is given.&lt;ref name="sbmich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denckla|first1=Derek A.|title=Nonlawyers and the Unauthorized Practice of Law: An Overview of the Legal and Ethical Parameters|journal=Fordham Law Revie w|date=1999|volume=67|issue=5|page=2581|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol67/iss5/32/|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic instruction on how to complete a legal form, where to place information on the form, and the definition of legal terms used on a form constitute the provision of legal information. Instructing a person on how to phrase information in a legal document or form, or advising the person as to what he or she should say in court, is the provision of legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unauthorized Practice of Law|url=https://www.scbar.org/public/get-legal-help/problems-your-lawyer/unauthorized-practice-of-law-committee/|website=South Carolina Bar|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt; Similarly, application of legal rules and principles to a specific set of facts and advising a course of conduct is almost always held to constitute legal advice.&lt;ref name="calcourt"/&gt;

According to the National Association of Legal Fee Analysis (NALFA), '''legal auditing''' is a [[litigation]] management practice and [[risk management]] tool, used by [[insurance]] and other consumers of legal services, to determine if hourly billing errors, abuses, and inefficiencies exist by carefully examining and identifying unreasonable [[Lawyer|attorney]] fees and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenalfa.org/ National Association of Legal Fee Analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the majority of corporate law firms charge clients on an hourly basis, and base attorney promotion and compensation almost entirely on the number of hours billed, rather than the results achieved for clients, lawyers and law firms have much incentive to bill as many hours as possible, and little incentive to work efficiently or to bill fewer hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litigationlimited.com/ten-facts/ Litigation Limited, Ten Things You Need to Know About Law Firm Billing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506124123/http://litigationlimited.com/ten-facts/ |date=2012-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[State Bar of California|California State Bar]], most lawyers who block-bill their time inflate each client bill by 10-30 percent, and at the average national billing rate of $661 per hour (as of April 2012) that means that most big-firm lawyers overcharge clients anywhere from $150,000 to $400,000 each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litigationlimited.com/ten-facts/ Litigation Limited, Ten Things You Need to Know About Law Firm Billing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506124123/http://litigationlimited.com/ten-facts/ |date=2012-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Legal auditors conduct a detailed analysis of original time records, attorney work production, expenses and hourly rate benchmarks. The purpose of a legal bill auditing is to save money for the insurance company and their clients. Many audits measure performance and quality of services in addition to cost alone. Legal Bill Auditors may be responsible for monitoring the matter as it progresses for purposes of giving a second opinion in major cases or as a post-mortem. Legal bill audits give insurance companies and their clients peace of mind and avoid possible future mistakes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In 2006, the firm [[Stuart Maue]] claimed to have conducted the largest legal audit on record during the [[OxyContin]] litigation, involving claims for attorney fees and expenses amounting to over $400,000,000 billed and audited, with the final negotiated [[Settlement (law)|settlement]] resulting in a reduction of $200,000,000 from the total billed amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2006/07/03/daily22.html Stuart Maue completes audit on $400M claim - ''St. Louis Business Journal''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal executives''' are a form of trained persons in the legal professional in certain jurisdictions. They often specialise in a particular area of [[law]]. The training that a  Legal Executive undertakes usually includes both vocational training (a minimum of 3 years for those in England and Wales) and academic qualifications.

Legal executives are associated with different membership bodies and different rights according to geographical regions. Legal executives are recognised in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]],  [[Hong Kong]] and The Bahamas. There is no direct equivalent to a legal executive in [[Scotland]]. In England and Wales they hold Chartered status and are members of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).

==England and Wales==
Chartered Legal Executives in England and Wales are lawyers.  They can become partners in law firms and are eligible to become judges and advocates subject to meeting eligibility requirements. As lawyers, they are subject to stringent regulation and a code of ethics as with barristers and solicitors.

Chartered Legal Executives (formerly known as Fellows of CILEx) qualify after completing their CILEX training followed by a minimum of 3 years qualifying employment. Chartered Legal Executives may do a wide range of legal work although, like solicitors, they generally specialise in one area:

* residential and commercial [[conveyancing]]
* [[will (law)|wills]] probate work and [[trusts]]
* personal injury
* family law
* criminal law
* employment law
* immigration law
* [[litigation]]
* practice management
 
After completing their academic training, trainee Legal Executives often occupy paralegal roles to satisfy the 3 year vocational stage of qualifying as Chartered Legal Executives.

===History===
The modern chartered legal executive evolved from the 19th-century managing clerk. When solicitor firms started to grow in the 19th century, they increasingly relied on an ever-expanding number of law clerks for drafting and organizing documents.  Some of these clerks in turn became knowledgeable about the law and were allowed to manage their fellow clerks; hence, they were called managing clerks.

In the 1950s and 1960s England suffered a shortage of solicitors when [[Post-World War II baby boom|population growth]] unexpectedly exceeded the number of entrants into the profession.  To improve the availability of legal services, the Law Society began aggressive recruitment efforts to convince young people to choose law as a career.  As part of this effort, the Law Society decided to turn the managing clerk into a true legal profession of its own and sponsored the ILEX's creation in 1963 as well as the change in title to legal executive. In the Law Society's own words, ILEX was intended "to stimulate recruitment to the unadmitted ranks of the professional status [...] and would offer [...] a career with proper incentives."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel-Smith and Robert Stevens, ''Lawyers and the Courts: A Sociological Study of the English Legal System, 1750-1965'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Legal Executives was granted a royal charter to chartered professional body status in October 2011 and on 30 January 2012, officially received its charter, from the Minister of Justice, Jonathan Djanogly and was officially launched as the 'Chartered Institute of Legal Executives'.

===CILEx===
The Chartered [[Institute of Legal Executives]] (CILEx) was founded in 1892 as the Solicitors Managing Clerks' Association and became the Institute of Legal Executives, a company limited by guarantee, in 1963 with the support of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]].  In England and Wales the Institute of Legal Executives received a Royal Charter in early 2012 to become the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Fully qualified members of CILEx in England and Wales are now therefore referred to as "Chartered Legal Executives".

CILEx is a professional body which represents Chartered legal executive lawyers and other legal practitioners and law staff. It has around 20,000 members.  All members of CILEx are independently regulated by ILEX Professional Standards (IPS), regardless of grade.

To qualify as a Chartered Legal Executive, aspiring Chartered Legal Executives undertake a series of training courses and are required to pass qualifications relevant to the area of practice in which they intend to specialise. The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_3_qualifications/diploma_in_law_and_practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; and is set at the equivalent to A-level law. The second and final qualifications are equivalent to an honours degree course - the CILEx Level 6 Diploma in Law and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_6_qualifications/level_6_diploma_law__practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Trainees will often work at the same time as studying in order to acquire practical skills. The courses can be undertaken at a college, university or through an open learning programme. The courses are open to graduates and non-graduates.

A trainee must also gain 3 years' vocational experience before being admitted as a Fellow.

====Membership Grades====

=====Fellows=====
Only Fellows of CILEx (FCILEx) can lawfully hold themselves out as Chartered Legal Executives and are qualified by law (by way of CILEx) to be [[commissioner of oaths|commissioners of oaths]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/professional_issues/comm_oaths.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; able to take [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] and [[affidavits]]. Fellows also can bring action in [[court]] and appear for clients in certain courts. Appearance in courts requires a separate CILEx qualification to become a Chartered Legal Executive Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/cilex_advocates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows (that is, Chartered Legal Executives) are also eligible to apply and compete with barristers and solicitors for appointment to certain judicial offices, such as the position of deputy or district judge.

=====Membership levels=====
In September 2009, the CILEx training in England and Wales changed.  The CILEx qualification now emphasises and examines the practical work of the law as well as continuing with the necessary academic examinations. At the same time, a number of new membership grades were introduced by CILEx. CILEx now offers the following membership categories which can be joined according to experience and qualifications held:

*student member - for those wishing to enter the legal profession, who have no relevant legal qualification, or those with less than three years’ work experience of a predominantly legal nature. 
*affiliate member - for those with at least one CILEx level-3 unit-qualifications, or who have completed a relevant level-2 legal qualification, or gained at least three years’ work of a predominantly legal nature. 
*associate member – for those who have completed their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice (the first stage of CILEx qualifications), or who are graduates with qualifying law degrees. Associate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters ACILEx after their name and be required to undertake [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). 
*graduate member - for those who have completed both their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and their CILEx level-6 Professional Higher Diploma in Law and Practice (including the CILEx Graduate ‘Fast-Track’ Diploma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/graduate_fast_track_diploma.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or who are Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Vocational Course (BVC) graduates. Graduate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters GCILEx after their name and be required to undertake CPD.

Students already holding a [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) or [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) qualifications are exempt from the CILEx academic qualifications and can immediately apply to become a graduate member. Graduate members must then work under the supervision of a qualified legal executive or a solicitor at a firm, either in-house at a private company or in government (provided their work is substantially of a legal rather than administrative nature). To apply to become a Fellow of the Chartered Institute they must have a minimum of three years' practical legal experience.

Once a student has successfully completed a period of qualifying employment, he or she will become a Fellow of CILEx, a qualified lawyer and will be allowed to hold themselves out as a Chartered Legal Executive and use the designatory letters FCILEx. Fellows (and other member grades) are required to maintain and improve their knowledge by undertaking CPD each year.  A proportion of those hours must relate to their area of specialism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are issued an annual practising certificate. Only qualified and practicing Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives may use the designatory title 'Chartered Legal Executives' which is a protected designation for practicing Fellows under its Royal Charter.

A CILEx Fellow who wishes to go on to qualify as a solicitor is usually allowed to forego the training contract aspect. For this exemption to apply, they must have attained fellowship level by the time they complete the vocational stage of solicitor training, i.e. the LPC. It goes without saying they must also have completed the academic stage; however, having come through the CILEx route to qualification, this usually means taking advanced modules of the CILEx level-6 qualification.

==Other Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
The Institute of Legal Executives (Victoria) was set up in 1966 and represents legal executives in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], it works with the Institute of Legal Executives (Australia) which was formed in 1994 and represents legal executives in the rest of Australia. Both Legal Executives organisations in Australia work to formalise legal training and promote education for the position of Legal Executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.asn.au/legalexecutives/index.html About the Institute of Legal Executives Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; They award Diplomas, Certificates in Professional Legal studies, as well as prizes and bursaries for students.

===Hong Kong===
The Law Society of Hong Kong set benchmark standards for those using the title 'legal executive' in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/circular/12-349a1.pdf|title=Benchmarks for Legal Executive Courses|last=Law Society of Hong Kong|first=|date=December 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HKUSPACE (an extension of the University of Hong Kong) runs two programs to meet the Law Society of Hong Kong benchmarks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/cls|title=Certificate in Legal Studies - HKU SPACE: Common Law, Professional Legal Studies courses|website=hkuspace.hku.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace-plk.hku.hk/programme/detail/higher-diploma-for-legal-executives|title=HKU SPACE Po Leung Kuk Stanley Ho Community College|website=hkuspace-plk.hku.hk|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal executive may be given certain limited rights of audience in accordance with the Court’s Practice Direction to represent lay clients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Institute of Legal Executives [[IILEX]] is the professional body representing legal executives in Ireland and with the stated aim to provide a system of training and examination and to obtain a recognised professional qualification for those engaged in legal work in Ireland.

====Categories of IILEX Membership====
*Senior Legal Executive Member S.I.I.L.Ex.
*Legal Executive Member M.I.I.L.Ex.
*Associate Member ACILEx
*Student Legal Executive Member &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html Categories of IILEX Membership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106183258/http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Legal Executives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzile.org.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[incorporated society]] which advances and protects the status and interests of legal executives. At present it has approximately 650 members.

===The Bahamas===
In The Bahamas, Legal Executives, like other members of the legal profession, are governed by and regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. The Legal Profession Act tasks the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with keeping a register which is known simply as the Register of Legal Executives.

Whereas Legal Executives practising in England and Wales now enjoy certain rights of audience, in The Bahamas, Legal Executives may only appear before a particular tribunal or authority after the attorney-general has had consultations with the Bar Council of the Bahamas Bar Association.

In The Bahamas, under the Legal Profession Act, it is unlawful for a person to hold himself or herself out as a Legal Executive if their name does not appear on the Register of Legal Executives. Any person who is found to be guilty of pretending to be a Legal Executive can be liable upon conviction to a fine of B$5,000.00, or imprisonment for a period of three years, or both.

The legal status of [[bitcoin]] (and related crypto instruments) varies substantially from state to state and is still undefined or changing in many of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042248 Assessing the Differences in Bitcoin &amp; Other Cryptocurrency Legality Across National Jurisdictions] ''Information Systems &amp; Economics eJournal.'' Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/coinmonks/cryptos-big-legal-problems-63b760385fea Crypto's Biggest Legal Problems] ''Crypto Law Review.'' Accessed 25 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;   

While some states have ''explicitly'' allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this [[cryptocurrency]] likely extend to similar systems as well.

The European Union has passed no specific legislation relative to the status of bitcoin as a currency, but has stated that VAT/GST is not applicable to the conversion between traditional (fiat) currency and bitcoin.

VAT/GST and other taxes (such as income tax) still apply to transactions made using bitcoins for goods and services. {{r|"regulation"|page=European Union}}

In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the 'bitcoin' virtual currency is exempt from VAT" and that "Member States must exempt, inter alia, transactions relating to 'currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender{{'"}}, making bitcoin a currency as opposed to being a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency is exempt from VAT|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150128en.pdf|publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bitcoin currency exchange not liable for VAT taxes: top EU court|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/22/us-bitcoin-tax-eu-idUSKCN0SG0X920151022|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=Reuters|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to judges, the tax should not be charged because bitcoins should be treated as a means of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bodoni|first1=Stephanie|last2=Thomson|first2=Amy|title=EU's Top Court Rules That Bitcoin Exchange Is Tax-Free|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/bitcoin-virtual-currency-exchange-is-tax-free-eu-court-says-ig21wzcd|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=BloombergBusiness|agency=Bloomberg|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[European Central Bank]], traditional financial sector regulation is not applicable to bitcoin because it does not involve traditional financial actors.&lt;ref name=ECB&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|date=October 2012|publisher=European Central Bank|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-92-899-0862-7|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|format=PDF|author=European Central Bank|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Others in the EU have stated, however, that existing rules can be extended to include bitcoin and bitcoin companies.{{r|"EUPARANNEX"}}

The European Central Bank classifies bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency.&lt;ref name="ECB" /&gt;{{rp|6}} In July 2014 the [[European Banking Authority]] advised European banks not to deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin until a regulatory regime was in place.&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;{{cite web|title=EBA Opinion on 'virtual currencies'|url=http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/EBA-Op-2014-08+Opinion+on+Virtual+Currencies.pdf|publisher=European Banking Authority|accessdate=8 July 2014|pages=46|format=pdf|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the European Parliament's proposal to set up a taskforce to monitor virtual currencies to combat money laundering and terrorism, passed by 542 votes to 51, with 11 abstentions, has been sent to the European Commission for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160524IPR28821/meps-call-for-virtual-currency-watchdog-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorism&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission also notably presented a "parallel" proposal aimed at preventing tax evasion techniques as revealed in the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coindesk.com/european-union-proposes-tighter-bitcoin-controls-panama-papers-response/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was revealed that the proposal will require cryptocurrency exchanges and [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s to identify suspicious activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/the-european-union-wants-to-identify-bitcoin-users/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[G7]]'s [[Financial Action Task Force]] issued the following statement in guidelines which may be applicable to companies involved in transmitting bitcoin and other currencies, "Internet-based payment services that allow third party funding from anonymous sources may face an increased risk of [money laundering/terrorist financing]." They concluded that this may "pose challenges to countries in [anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing] regulation and supervision".&lt;ref name=fatf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-RBA-NPPS.pdf|title=Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Prepaid Cards, Mobile Payments and Internet-based Payment Services|work=Guidance for a risk-based approach|publisher=Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|accessdate=6 March 2014|location=Paris|page=47|format=PDF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Journal Officiel" (28 December 2017):

Art. 117. — The purchase, sale, use, and holding of so-called virtual currency is prohibited. Virtual currency is that used by internet users via the web. It is characterized by the absence of physical support such as coins, notes, payments by cheque or credit card. Any breach of this provision is punishable in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.joradp.dz/FTP/jo-francais/2017/F2017076.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2017 the exchange office issued a public statement in which it declared, "The Office des Changes wishes to inform the general public that the transactions via virtual currencies constitute an infringement of the exchange regulations, liable to penalties and fines provided for by [existing laws] in force."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oc.gov.ma/portal/sites/default/files/actualites/communiqu%C3%A9%20monnaies%20virtuelles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, the monetary authorities also reacted in a statement issued jointly by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Bank Al-Maghrib and the Moroccan Capital Market Authority (AMMC), warning against risks associated with bitcoin, which may be used "for illicit or criminal purposes, including money laundering and terrorist financing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ammc.ma/sites/default/files/communique%20monnaies%20virtuelles%20FR_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2017, Abdellatif Jouahri, governor of Bank Al-Maghrib, said at a press conference held in Rabat during the last quarterly meeting of the Bank Al-Maghrib's Board of 2017 that bitcoin is not a currency but a "financial asset", He also warned of its dangers and called for a framework to be put in place for consumer protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menara.ma/fr/actualit%C3%A9s/economie/2017/12/20/2333841-le-digital-champ-de-bataille-de-bank-al-maghrib-en-2018.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 17 January 2017, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has passed a circular to inform all Nigerian banks that bank transactions in bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.naij.com/1083244-central-bank-nigeria-bans-transaction-bitcoins-onecoin-others.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the year, the CBN (through its Deputy Director on Banking and Payments System, Musa Itopa-Jimoh) clarified the circular and its stance on bitcoin, citing that a lot of people misinterpret the central bank’s recent warning. It noted that  "Central bank cannot control or regulate bitcoin. Central bank cannot control or regulate blockchain. Just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the Internet. We don’t own it".&lt;ref&gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-says-we-cant-stop-bitcoin/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, a committee was set up by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) to look into the possibility of the country adopting the technology driving bitcoin and other digital currencies – blockchain. The committee has submitted its report but "several sub-committees are still working on the issue" according to the Director, Banking &amp; Payments System Department at CBN, Mr. ‘Dipo Fatokun.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.today.ng/technology/internet/2575/nigeria-adopted-bitcoin-technology-cbn&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies dealing in virtual currencies must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (Fintrac), implement compliance programs, keep the required records, report suspicious or terrorist-related transactions, and determine if any of their customers are "politically exposed persons."

The law applies to non-Canadian virtual currency exchanges if they have Canadian customers. Banks may not open or maintain accounts or have a correspondent banking relationship with companies dealing in virtual currencies if that company is not registered with Fintrac.

Dealers in digital currency are regulated as money services businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/intro-eng.asp|title=Money services businesses (MSBs)|last=Canada|first=Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of|website=www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Assembly of Ecuador banned bitcoins including other decentralized digital/crypto currencies, due to the establishment of a new state-run electronic money system. Ecuador's new project would be controlled by the government and tied directly to the local currency—the dollar. Users will be able to pay for select services and send money between individuals. This was slated to begin in mid-February 2015.

As of February 2018 the Thai central bank has prohibited financial institutions in the country from five key cryptocurrency activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-thailand-bans-banks-from-cryptocurrency-activities/&lt;/ref&gt; These include 1) Investing or trading in cryptocurrency 2) Exchanging cryptocurrencies 3) Creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading 4) Allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies 5) Advising customers on cryptocurrency investing and trading. Banks complying with these new rules include [[Bangkok Bank]], [[SIAM Commercial Bank]] and [[Krungsri]].

On 29-6-2018 The SEC and Revenue Department of Thailand announced that Bitcoin trading would be subject to 15% Capital Gains Tax and 7% VAT. Exchanges would be required collect 15% Withholding and 7% VAT on all trades. This will require all customers of Bitcoin Exchanges to provide purchase price information to the Exchange, who will be required to track and report all trades. This announcement has the potential to a) Make regulated exchanges unprofitable b) Move trading in Thailand to exchanges that have not registered and are prepared to run the risks associated this not registering c) Move Bitcoin buy/sell business to LocalBitcoins.com, unregulated and unregistered individual traders that do not follow KYC rules. Because the approach of the SEC and Revenue Department is to invite companies to register, but are still unclear on the logistics of collecting taxes, anyone registering takes on significant risk if the Revenue Department decides to change the rules and backdate the changes. Note: The Revenue Department will not allow trade losses to be offset against profits.

They added that trading virtual currencies in Poland does not violate national or EU law, however, having virtual "currencies", involves many risks: (1) risk related to the possibility of loss of funds due to theft, (2) risk related to lack of guarantee, (3) risk of lack of universal acceptability, (4) risk related to the possibility of fraud, (5) risk of high price change. Because of these risks, the NBP and KNF warn against buying virtual currencies and investing in them. The NBP and KNF recognize that the purchase, possession and sale of virtual currencies by entities supervised by the KNF (e.g. banks) would be burdened with high risk and would not ensure a stable and prudent management of the financial institution. Financial institutions should be cautious about engaging and cooperating with virtual currency "trading" entities.

The [[Taxation in Finland|Finnish Tax Administration]] has issued instructions for the taxation of virtual currencies, including the bitcoin.{{r|"regulation"|page=Finland}}&lt;ref name="veroohje"&gt;https://www.vero.fi/syventavat-vero-ohjeet/ohje-hakusivu/48411/virtuaalivaluuttojen_tuloverotu/&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a currency or a security, a bitcoin transaction is considered a private contract equivalent to a [[contract for difference]] for tax purposes. Purchases of goods with bitcoin or conversion of bitcoin into legal currency "realizes" the value and any increase in price will be taxable; however, losses are not tax-deductible. Mined bitcoin is considered earned income.&lt;ref name="veroohje" /&gt;

Ruling 034/2014 by the Finnish Central Board of Taxes (CBT) stated that commission fees charged on bitcoin purchases by an exchange market were, under the EU VAT Directive, banking services and therefore VAT exempt. This is because the court classified bitcoins as payment instruments - whereas most countries treat their use as an unregulated method for the exchange of goods, or even as a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.internationaltaxreview.com/Article/3400689/Tax-Disputes/Finland-recognises-Bitcoin-services-as-VAT-exempt.html | title = Finland recognises Bitcoin services as VAT exempt | author = Joe Stanley-Smith | date = 14 November 2014 | accessdate = 15 November 2014 | publisher = International Tax Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vero.fi/syventavat-vero-ohjeet/ennakkoratkaisut/54360/kvl034201/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norwegian Tax Administration]] stated in December 2013 that they don't define bitcoin as money but regard it as an [[asset]]. Profits are subjected to wealth tax. In business, use of bitcoin falls under the [[sales tax]] regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Saleha Mohsin (13 December 2013) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-12/bitcoins-fail-real-money-test-in-scandinavia-s-wealthiest-nation.html Bitcoins Fail Currency Test in Scandinavia’s Richest Nation] Bloomberg.

The [[Swedish Tax Agency]] has given a preliminary ruling on Value Added Tax (VAT) on bitcoins, stating that trade in bitcoins is not subject to Swedish VAT, but is instead subject to the Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) regulations and treated as a currency. The decision has been appealed by the Swedish Tax Authority.{{r|"regulation"|page=Sweden}}

The Swedish jurisdiction is in general quite favorable for bitcoin businesses and users as compared to other countries within the EU and the rest of the world. The governmental regulatory and supervisory body [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden)|Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority]] (Finansinspektionen) have legitimized the fast growing industry by publicly proclaiming bitcoin and other digital currencies as a means of payment. For certain businesses interacting with [[fiat money|fiat]] (mainly exchanges) the current regulation dictates that an application for approval/license must be filed and all the AML/CTF and KYC regulations applicable to more traditional financial service providers must be followed.

In 2016 the National Bank of Republic of Macedonia published a press release regarding an investigation it made into ONECOIN, and discouraged the citizens from investing in it since it was most likely a scam. In the same press release the NBRM quoted the law on Foreign Exchange Operations, but since cryptocurrencies do not constitute a foreign currency as they are quoted by the law, it leaves them unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbrm.mk/ns-newsarticle-soopshtieniie_na_nbrm_28_9_2016.nspx|title=Announcement by NBRM|date=28 September 2016|work=National Bank of Republic of Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitcoin is treated as 'private money'.  When bitcoin is exchanged for sterling or for foreign currencies, such as euro or dollar, no VAT will be due on the value of the bitcoins themselves. However, in all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency. Profits and losses on cryptocurrencies are subject to [[Capital gains tax#United Kingdom|capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax treatment of activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/briefs/vat/brief0914.htm|publisher=HM Revenue &amp; Customs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

The '''National Admissions Test for Law''', or '''LNAT''', is an admissions aptitude test that was adopted in 2004 by eight [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[university]] law programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3451897.stm Education: New entry test for law students], [[BBC News]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as an admissions requirement for home applicants. The test was established at the leading urgency of [[Oxford University]] as an answer to the problem facing universities trying to select from an increasingly competitive pool with similarly high [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]. With effect from its second year, the LNAT is required for UK and overseas applicants alike. There are now nine participating law schools and hundreds of test centres worldwide.

==Format==
The LNAT is 135 minutes long and consists of two sections. The test taker is allotted 40 minutes to complete the essay and 95 minutes to answer 42 multiple-choice questions aimed at measuring reading comprehension and logical reasoning skills. The reading portion contains twelve short passages, with three or four questions about each passage. The questions typically ask for terms and arguments from the reading to be defined by inference. The essay portion is 40 minutes long and involves the candidate answering one of three available essay questions. The questions are generally open-ended prompts that can focus on any one of a wide variety of issues.&lt;ref name="LNAT Format"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lnat.ac.uk/what-is-lnat/test-format/ | title=Test format – LNAT | publisher=LNAT Consortium Ltd | accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reading section is scored out of 42 and the essays are individually marked by [[proctor]]s at the respective universities.

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14366">A '''pocket veto''' is a legislative maneuver that allows a [[president]] or other official with [[veto]] power to exercise that power over a bill by taking no action (instead of affirmatively vetoing it).

==Finland==
The [[President of Finland]] has the power to pocket veto bills passed by the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]]; however, such vetoes are temporary in effect.

==India==
Article 111 of the Indian constitution stipulates that the [[President of India|President]] shall give assent to a bill passed by both houses of the parliament or return the bill as soon as possible for reconsideration with his recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-indexenglish.htm |title=THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] does not give a specific time limit for presidential action on a bill sent by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing action on a bill, the president effectively vetoes it. However, if a president receives a bill he or she had previously vetoed and sent back to Parliament, where such a veto has been overruled by another Parliamentary vote, then such a bill becomes an act within fourteen days of the President's receiving it regardless of his or her subsequent action or inaction.&lt;ref name="intro india"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Constitution of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;pg=PA145 | publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Learning Pvt.

==United States==
A pocket veto occurs when a bill fails to become law because the president does not sign the bill and cannot return the bill to Congress within a 10-day period because Congress is not in session. Article 1, Section 7 of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a Law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a Law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Constitution limits the president's period for decision on whether to sign or return any legislation to ten days (not including Sundays) while the [[United States Congress]] is in session. A return veto happens when the president sends a bill, along with his objections, back to the house of Congress from which it originated. Congress can override the veto by a two-thirds vote of both chambers, whereupon the bill becomes law. If Congress prevents the bill's return by being adjourned during the 10-day period, and the president does not sign the bill, a "pocket veto" occurs and the bill does not become law. Congress can adjourn and designate an agent to receive veto messages and other communications so that a pocket veto cannot happen, an action Congresses have routinely taken for decades. If a bill is pocket vetoed while Congress is out of session, the only way for Congress to circumvent the pocket veto is to reintroduce the legislation as a new bill, pass it through both chambers, and present it to the President again for signature. On the other hand, Congress may override a regular veto without introducing new legislation through the process described in the U.S. Constitution. [[James Madison]] became the first president to use the pocket veto in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30909.pdf |title=The Pocket Veto: Its Current Status |last=Fisher |first=Louis |publisher=United States Senate |date=March 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Presidents throughout United States history, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had an outstanding number of pocket vetoes, more than anyone before or after him. During his presidency from 1933-1945 Roosevelt had vetoed 635 bills, 263 of which were pocket vetoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/Presidents/RooseveltF.pdf|title=U.S. Senate: Vetoes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.senate.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the presidents after him until George W. Bush had pocket vetoes pass while they were in office; the one with the most after Roosevelt was Dwight D. Eisenhower who had 108. George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama both had zero pocket vetoes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Vetoes|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
Courts have never fully clarified when an adjournment by Congress would "prevent" the president from returning a vetoed bill. Some presidents have interpreted the Constitution to restrict the pocket veto to the [[adjournment sine die]] of Congress at the end of the second session of the two-year congressional term, while others interpreted it to allow intersession and intrasession pocket vetoes. In 1929, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' that a bill had to be returned to the chamber while it is in session and capable of work. While upholding President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pocket veto, the court said that the "determinative question is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill". In 1938, the Supreme Court reversed itself in part in ''[[Wright v. U.S.]]'', ruling that Congress could designate agents on its behalf to receive veto messages when it was not in session, saying that the Constitution "does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return". A three-day recess of the Senate was considered a short enough time that the Senate could still act with "reasonable promptitude" on the veto. However, a five-month adjournment would be a long enough period to enable a pocket veto. Within those constraints, there still exists some ambiguity. Presidents have been reluctant to pursue disputed pocket vetoes to the Supreme Court for fear of an adverse ruling that would serve as a precedent in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/GOV/leg_gloss.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207060840/http://www.lib.umd.edu/GOV/leg_gloss.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |title=Glossary of Legislative Terminology |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in citation|date=May 2016}}

===George W. Bush===
In December 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] claimed that he had pocket vetoed {{nowrap|{{USBill|110|H.R.|1585}}}}, the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071228-5.html |title=Memorandum of Disapproval |publisher=The White House|date=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the House of Representatives had designated agents to receive presidential messages before adjourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/46161.html |title=Is Bush Inventing Another Constitutional Power? |last=Spitzer |first=Robert J. |publisher=History News Network |date=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had been previously passed by veto-proof majorities in both the House and the Senate. If the president had chosen to veto the bill, he would have been required to return it to the chamber in which it originated, in this case the House of Representatives. The House then could have voted to override the veto, and the Senate could have done likewise. In the event that each house had voted by at least two-thirds vote to override the veto, the bill would have become law.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Clause 2 reads "Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law."&lt;/ref&gt;

Then House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-CA) stated: "Congress vigorously rejects any claim that the president has the authority to pocket veto this legislation and will treat any bill returned to the Congress as open to an override vote."&lt;ref name="TPM"&gt;Paul Kiel, [http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/005010.php "Today's Must Read"], [http://talkingpointsmemo.com/ ''Talking Points Memorandum''], January 3, 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-03&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2008, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel stated: "A pocket veto, as you know, is essentially putting it in your pocket and not taking any action whatsoever. And when Congress – the House is out of session – in this case it's our view that bill then would not become law."&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt;

Louis Fisher, a constitutional scholar at the [[Library of Congress]] indicated: "The administration would be on weak grounds in court because they would be insisting on what the Framers decidedly rejected: an absolute veto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/13989-democrats-say-bush-cant-pocket-veto-defense-bill|title=Democrats say Bush can't pocket veto defense bill|last=Alarkon|first=Walter|date=January 2, 2008|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; By "absolute veto" Fisher was referring to the fact that a bill that has been pocket vetoed cannot be overridden. Instead, the bill must be reintroduced into both houses of Congress, and again passed by both houses, an effort which can be very difficult to achieve.

In the end, the House of Representatives did not attempt to override the veto. Instead, in January 2008, the House effectively killed H.R. 1585 by referring it to the Armed Services Committee and passing H.R. 4986, a bill nearly identical to H.R. 1585 but slightly modified to meet the President's objection, which subsequently became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-4986 |title=H.R. 4986: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 |publisher=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the first time that a president has attempted to pocket veto a bill despite the presence of agents to receive his veto message. Both [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] made similar attempts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidential-Vetoes/Presidential-Vetoes/ |title=Presidential Vetoes |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] used it against the [[Wade-Davis Bill]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Spitzer, "The Law: The 'Protective Return' Pocket Veto: Presidential Aggrandizement of Constitutional Power", ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', vol. 31, no. 4, Dec. 2001, pp. 720–732.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana===
After nearly a century of pocket vetoes, the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] ruled pocket vetoes unconstitutional in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''State ex rel. Mass Transportation Authority v. Indiana Revenue Board'', 251 Ind. 607, 244 N.E.2d 111 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Edgar Whitcomb]] requested that the General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly a century old.  The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.&lt;ref name = g405&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Gugin, Linda C. |editor2=St. Clair, James E |title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other use==
Because a pocket veto cannot be overridden, it is sometimes used to describe situations where either one person, or a small group, can override the will of a much larger group without consequence. For example, when the [[California Supreme Court]] was answering the [[certified question]] of intervenor standing in the case of ''[[Perry v. Brown]]'' (known as the [[Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] case), one of the justices expressed concern that denying appellate standing to initiative proponents would mean that the governor and state attorney general would "essentially get a 'pocket veto{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2011/09/06/live-blogging-todays-ca-supreme-court-hearing-on-standing-in-the-prop-8-perry-case/|title=Live-blogging: Today’s CA Supreme Court hearing on standing in the Prop 8 (Perry) case|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[political philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]]''' (1724–1804) favoured a [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=358 Kant’s Principles of Politics, including his essay on Perpetual Peace. A Contribution to Political Science]'', translation by W. Hastie, Edinburgh: Clark, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' (1795), Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics  by establishment of political [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (377). For a summary and&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in ''Doctrine of Right'' (1797), the first part of ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Riedel]] ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century Kant's political philosophy had been enjoying a remarkable renaissance in English-speaking countries with more major studies in a few years than had appeared in the preceding many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kant's Political Philosophy: Rechtsstaat or Council Democracy?|jstor = 1406673|journal = The Review of Politics|date = 1985-04-01|pages = 253–280|volume = 47|issue = 2|first = A. Anthony|last = Smith|doi=10.1017/s003467050003672x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kant's most significant contribution to political philosophy and the [[philosophy of law]] is the doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]''. According to this doctrine, the power of the state is limited in order to protect [[citizen]]s from the arbitrary exercise of [[authority]]. The ''Rechtsstaat'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Rechtsstaat|Rechtsstaat]]}}) is a concept in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking, originally borrowed from [[Germany|German]] [[jurisprudence]], which can be translated as "the legal state" or "state of rights". It is a  "constitutional [[State (polity)|state]]" in which the exercise of [[government]]al power is constrained by the [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], ''The Concept of the Political'', ch. 7; ''Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt; and is often tied to the [[Anglo-America]]n concept of the [[rule of law]]. Kant's political philosophy has been described as [[liberalism|liberal]] for its presumption of limits on the state based on the [[social contract]] as a regulative matter.&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland,  2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part 1), Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Rechtsstaat'', the citizens share legally based [[civil liberties]] and they can use the [[court]]s. A country cannot be a [[liberal democracy]] without first being a ''Rechtsstaat''. German writers usually place [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the ''Rechtsstaat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rechtsstaat'' in the meaning of "constitutional state" was introduced in the latest works of Immanuel Kant after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and constitutional government. Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a state is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty century.

The ''Rechtsstaat'' concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'': "The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of the theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, in ''History of Political Philosophy'', edited by [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''Rechtsstaat'' appeared in the German context in [[Robert von Mohl]]'s book ''Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates'' ("German police science according to the principles of the constitutional state", 1832–1834), and was contrasted with the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[police state]].

Kant opposed "democracy"{{spaced ndash}}which, in that era, meant [[direct democracy]]{{spaced ndash}}believing that [[majority rule]] posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "…democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which "all" decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, "all", who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As most writers at the time he distinguished three forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of government.

A distinctive feature of Kant's political philosophy is his conviction that the university should be a model of creative conflict: the philosopher's role within the university should be to "police" the higher faculties (which in his day were theology, law and medicine), making sure their teaching conforms to the principles of reason; likewise, the goal of perpetual peace in society can be achieved only when the rulers consult with philosophers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation and defense of these two aspects of Kant's political theory, see Stephen Palmquist's essays: [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KIUMWP.htm "Kant's Ideal of the University as a Model for World Peace"], in ''Papers of International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant'' (Tehran, Iran: Allame Tabataba'i University Press, 2005), pp.207-222; and [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/PSAP.htm "The Philosopher as a 'Secret Agent' for Peace: Taking Seriously Kant's Revival of the 'Old Question'"], in Valerio Rohden, Ricardo R.

Internationalen Kant-Kongresses'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp.601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

===Biblical===
{{Main|Bechor}}
[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= |page=145 |doi=10.2307/845880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where  nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Holly |year=1997 |title=Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia:" Ancient Feudal Restraints" and Revolutionary Reform |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=307–346 |jstor=2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004), p 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.
}}

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''royal commission''' is a major ad-hoc formal [[public inquiry]] into a defined issue in some [[monarchy|monarchies]]. They have been held in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].  A royal commission is similar in function to a '''commission of enquiry''' (or '''inquiry''') found in other countries such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Africa]], and regions such as [[Hong Kong]]. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a [[judge]] but restricted to the [[terms of reference]] of the commission. The commission is created by the head of state (the sovereign, or his/her representative in the form of a governor-general or governor) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by [[letters patent]]. In practice—unlike lesser forms of inquiry—once a commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish.

Royal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy.  These can be matters such as government structure, the treatment of minorities, events of considerable public concern or economic questions. Many royal commissions last many years and, often, a different government is left to respond to the findings. 

== Notable royal commissions ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia—and particularly [[New South Wales]]—royal commissions have been investigations into police and government [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[organised crime]] using the very broad coercive powers of the royal commissioner to defeat the protective systems that powerful, but corrupt, public officials had used to shield themselves from conventional investigation.

Royal commissions are usually chaired by one or more notable figures. Because of their [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] powers the commissioners are often [[retire]]d or serving judges. They usually involve research into an issue, consultations with experts both within and outside government and public consultations as well. The warrant may grant immense investigatory powers, including summoning witnesses under [[oath]], offering of indemnities, seizing of documents and other evidence (sometimes including those normally protected, such as [[classified information]]), holding hearings ''[[in camera]]'' if necessary and—in a few cases—compelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the Commission. The results of Royal Commissions are published in reports, often massive, of findings containing policy recommendations. (Due to the verbose nature of the titles of these formal documents – for example, the [[Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer]] – they are commonly known by the name of the commission's chair.)  While these reports are often quite influential, with the government enacting some or all recommendations into law, the work of some commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government. In other cases, where the commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms, the commission has been dissolved by a superior court.

It is present in a shortened form in an engraving of Oliver Cromwell by William Faithorne.

[[John Locke]] uses it as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in the form {{lang|la|Salus populi suprema lex}} in his ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' and refers to it as a fundamental rule for government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John |year=1689 |title=An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government |at=Chapter XIII, section 158 |url=http://www.johnlocke.net/two-treatises-of-government-book-ii/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the inscription on the cornet of [[Roundhead]] and [[Leveller]] [[William Rainsborowe]] during the [[English Civil War]]. This motto was also endorsed by Hobbes at the beginning of Chapter 30 of ''Leviathan'' and by Spinoza in Chapter 19 of his ''Theological-Political Treatise.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tenement''' (from the Latin [[wiktionary:tenere#Latin|tenere]] ''to hold''), in law, is anything that is held, rather than owned.  This usage is a holdover from [[feudalism]], which still forms the basis of all real-estate law in the English-speaking world, in which the [[monarch]] alone owned the [[allodial title]] to all the land within his [[Realm|kingdom]].

Under feudalism, land itself was never privately "owned" but rather was "held" by a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (from Latin ''teneo'' "to hold") as a [[Fee (feudal tenure)|fee]], being merely a legal right over land known in modern law as an [[estate in land]]. This was held from a superior [[lord|overlord]], ( a [[mesne lord]]), or from [[The Crown|the crown]] itself in which case the holder was termed a [[tenant-in-chief]], upon some manner of service under one of a variety of [[feudal land tenure]]s.  The thing held is called a tenement, the holder is called a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], the manner of his holding is called a [[tenure]], and the superior is called the [[landlord]], or lord of the fee. These forms are still preserved in law, even though feudalism itself is extinct, because all real estate law has developed from them over centuries.

[[Feudal land tenure]] existed in many varieties. The sole surviving form in the United States is that species of [[freehold (law)|freehold]] known as ''free [[socage]]''. Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the "lord of the fee" is the State itself, and the service due to this "lord" is payment of the taxes upon the real estate.  The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the [[wiktionary:forfeit|forfeiture]] of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of [[eminent domain]], whereby the "lord of the fee" might take back the estate, provided he make [[just compensation]]. Also existing in a vestigial form is the concept of [[escheat]], under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.

An interesting side effect of this is that government entities do not pay real estate taxes to other government entities since government entities own the land rather than hold the land.  Localities that depend on real estate taxes to provide services are often put at a disadvantage when the state or federal government acquires a piece of land.  Sometimes, to mollify local public opinion, the state or federal government may volunteer to make payments in lieu of taxes ([[PILOT (finance)|PILOT]] or PILT programs) to local governments.
