== Biography ==
20syl, originally a [[graphic designer]], graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in [[Nantes Metropolis|Nantes Métropole]]. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in [[Rezé]].

In 1995, 20Syl and Cambia released their first [[mixtape]], ''Première Formule.'' Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of 20Syl, to form the group [[Hocus Pocus (group)|Hocus Pocus]], and released their first album as a trio, ''Seconde Formule'', in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called [[C2C (group)|C2C]] (Coups2Cross). C2C was the world champion [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]] team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two [[MC (hip hop)|MCs]] and a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] did not work on stage and went their separate ways; 20Syl continued his productions and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/11135-hocus-pocus/bio|title=Biographie de Hocus Pocus - Universal Music France|website=Universal Music France|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, 20syl worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label ''On &amp; On'' and released the maxi ''Sick'', which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album ''73 Touches'' (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to [[Miles Davis]] and [[Billie Holiday]]. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of ''Sick'' and six new titles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The album ''Place 54'', released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category "[[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album|Best Urban Contemporary Album]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

20syl published his first solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''Motifs,'' on the 9 June 2014; the site [http://Sourdoreille.net sourdoreille.net] considers this EP as "a real gem"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc/ |title=Le premier EP de 20syl est une pépite {{!}} Sourdoreille |deadurl=no |archivedate=14 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914053818/http://www.sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc |accessdate=4 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [http://wordplaymagazine.com/ wordplaymagazine.com] praises 20syl's style as "frankly remarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wordplaymagazine.com/2015/06/articles/reviews/20-syl-motifs-2/|title=20 Syl – Motifs 2|date=13 June 2015 |newspaper=Wordplay Magazine|language=en-US|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second EP, ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'', was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'' &lt;abbr&gt;20syl&lt;/abbr&gt; explains: "For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/20syl-j-ai-envie-de-tout-controler_1685660.html|title=20syl: "I want to control everything"|last=|first=|date=4 December 2016|newspaper=LExpress.fr|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 in [[Nantes]], 20syl presented the U, an interactive musical [[Rampe|skateboard ramp]] (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onandon-records.com/leU/|title=Le U rampe sonore {{!}} Rampe de skate Interactive et musicale|website=www.onandon-records.com|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://herrmuttlobby.com// herrmuttlobby.com] says regarding U "The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herrmuttlobby.com/|title=herrmuttlobby.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 [[Keynote (presentation software)|The Apple Keynote]] used a piece of 20syl to promote the functionality of [[Siri]] on the Apple Watch in their [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKotmAS-2Ac "Choose Colorfully"] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.applemusic.info/|title=AppleMusic.info - The definitive list of music used by Apple Inc. in commercials, keynote addresses, presentations, and other marketing materials.|website=www.applemusic.info|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, 20syl published a remix of the Pulpalicious song ''How I Feel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|title=Quand 20syl remixe Pulpalicious - TheWebTape|date=22 December 2015|newspaper=TheWebTape|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406103500/http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled ''Inertia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenroom.fr/88013-20syl-sort-un-nouveau-single-pour-la-bonne-cause/|title=20Syl sort un nouveau single pour la bonne cause - Greenroom|date=15 January 2016 |newspaper=Greenroom|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2016, he published a remix of the song ''Walk Walk'' by [[Yael Naim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.quai-baco.com/20syl-revisite-le-titre-walk-walk-de-yael-naim-24892/|title=20syl revisite le titre " Walk Walk " de Yael Naim|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he formed the group [[AllttA]] (A Little Lower Than The Angels) with the Californian rapper [[Mr. J. Medeiros]]. Their debut album, titled ''The Upper Hand'', was released on February 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mr20syl/photos/a.138869306156683.25026.101405206569760/1273193322724270|title=facebook.com/mr20syl|last=|first=|date=|website=facebook.com|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1996-1999)===
Tony's friends Robert and Jerry traveled to [[Arkansas]] to train with professional wrestlers [[The Moondogs]] and invited him to come along.&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; After watching several training sessions, Tony was invited into the ring. He soon began training alongside his friends, free of charge, because [[Moondog Spot]] felt that Tony "was a natural for the business."&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; Tony started wrestling in [[Indiana]] in a small bingo hall, where he first met wrestler [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]].&lt;ref name="WWD9"/&gt; He, Robinson, and [[Mad Man Pondo]] began traveling throughout the country together.&lt;ref name="WWD10"&gt;{{cite video |people=2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson (Interviewees) |date=2010-09-27 |title=Wrestling with Disaster 10 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIvaXDWOgOM  |medium=internet production |publisher=Legit Wrestling |accessdate=2010-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video distribution company Smart Mark Video helped the trio gain national exposure.&lt;ref name="WWD10"/&gt;

===Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (1999-2007)===
Tony began working for [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South]] (IWA-MS) in 1999. He wrestled his first match against Rolling Hard, where he was introduced to the [[hardcore wrestling]] style of the company.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"&gt;{{cite video |people=Mr. Wrestling (interviewer), 2 Tuff Tony (interviewee) |date=2011-03-02 |title=JCW's 2 Tuff Tony on Ultraviolent Radio 3-2-2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRaIOS28ts |medium=Internet Interview |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that Tony had never wrestled in the hardcore style before, Mad Man Pondo requested to work with him in matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; The promotion's owner, [[Ian Rotten]], supported the idea and booked the two in a rivalry.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; Pondo acquainted him to the proper techniques of hardcore wrestling, and Tony later recalled that Pondo "took good care of me" in their matches.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt;

On April 29, 1999, Tony defeated Pondo for the [[IWA Mid-South Hardcore Championship]].&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-hc.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Hardcore Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the championship on May 14 to Pondo, but won it back the following day.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt; The following February he lost the championship, but won the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] two weeks later.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/iwams/iwams-h.html |title=Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South Heavyweight Title |accessdate=2011-03-17 |publisher=Puroreso Dojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, he defeated Pondo and Delilah Starr to unify the IWA-MS Hardcore and Heavyweight Championships.&lt;ref name="IWAHardcore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; Two weeks later, Tony lost the championship.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt; He won it for a second time the following March 2, before losing it to Mitch Page a month later.&lt;ref name="IWAHeavyweight"/&gt;

In 2006, Tony and Mad Man Pondo took part in the first [[IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch#IWA Mid-South Double Death Tag Team Tournament|Double Death Tag Team Tournament]], though they weren't told which team would win the tournament.&lt;ref name="UltraviolentRadio"/&gt; They defeated Children of Pain then Dysfunction and Corporal Robinson to make it to the finals. In the finals, Tony and Pondo defeated Tough Crazy Bastards to be crowned the first Double Death Tag Team Tournament champions.

Tony continued wrestling for Juggalo Championship Wrestling, including matches at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] festivals and two other videos released by the company.

Tony went on tour with JCW in 2007 to film the [[internet]] [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] show [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling#SlamTV!|SlamTV!]], where he was involved in a rivalry with [[Tracy Smothers]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-09-18|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194583|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy attacked Tony in the sixth episode, causing Tony to be knocked out of action for several weeks.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Per storyline, Smothers was arrested just days before Tony's return on the eighth episode, leaving Tony with no way to seek revenge.&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1"/&gt; Tony was attacked by [[Bull Pain]] at East Side Wars, but later defeated him in a [[Hillerich &amp; Bradsby|Louisville Slugger]] match at [[Bloodymania (2007)|Bloodymania]].&lt;ref name="JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2"&gt;{{cite video|date=2007-10-30|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194584/|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2008, Tony and [[Violent J]] won the [[JCW Tag Team Championship]]. However, their victory was declared void, stricken from the record, and the title was vacated.&lt;ref name="Jan262008"&gt;{{cite web |title=JCW January 26, 2008 |url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=1&amp;nr=18279 |publisher=Cagematch |accessdate=13 August 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlamTV2-1"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Slam TV Season 2 - Episode 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ph1KX5BiQ |series=SlamTV! |credits=Creator and Producer: [[Insane Clown Posse]] |location=Toledo, Ohio |airdate=2008-06-16 |season=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Main Event Feb 22"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Feb 22, 2011|series=The Main Event |url=http://wfuckoffradio.com/wpress/?p=51 |credits=Presenters: [[Violent J]], 2 Tuff Tony, and [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]] |station=WFKO |airdate=2011-02-22 |minutes= 3:21:00|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512054432/http://wfuckoffradio.com/the-main-event|archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony continued his rivalry with Tracy Smothers into season two of SlamTV!

At the 2008 Hallowicked After-Party, Tony joined the group the [[Juggalo World Order]].

'''A-Lin''' ({{zh|c=阿玲|p=Ā Líng}}), also known by her birth name '''Huang Li-ling''' and her [[Amis people|Amis]] name '''Lisang Pacidal Koyouan''', is an [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] [[Music of Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]], [[lyricist]], and occasional [[composer]] of [[Amis people|Amis]] descent.

==Career==
In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 years old and taught children to sing the hymn “[[Amazing Grace]]” after the [[921 earthquake]] in [[Nantou County]], she was discovered by her former agent. However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woNRarO0ZZU Little Swallows Night 2011-11-25 pt.2/3 Dingdang A-Lin]&lt;/ref&gt;

A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next [[A-Mei]], who is an aboriginal singer of [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] descent. She also got the nickname 天生歌姬, meaning "A Born Diva". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.

A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with [[Xiao Yu (singer)|Xiao Yu]] and [[Shin (singer)|Shin]] in 2012 at the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://corporate.valentlau.com.au/blog/a-lin-sydney-live-concert/ | title = Sydney Live Concert with Xiaoyu and Shin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, with [[Avex Taiwan]] exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under [[Avex]] like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.

After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.

In 2015, she participated in the third season of [[I Am a Singer (Chinese TV series)|I Am a Singer]] and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.

==Style==
While A-Lin considers herself as an [[Contralto]], she has been noted to have an extremely wide vocal range closely identical to that of [[Amanda Seyfried]], as noted in many of her songs to have over two octaves or more, and in the concert in Auckland, New Zealand, she was suffering from illnesses that made her unable to hit her falsetto range.  She has also notably performed "Remember", by [[A-Mei]], in [[infantile speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZzouYGKGjE A-Lin's "Remember" in infantile speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A-Lin is the youngest in her family, her parents are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s and love music.
A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Lea Huang,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y66wKo3Mow A-Lin's sister appeared in her autograph session]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=506240312729213 Lea Huang on Facebook - Lea &amp; A-Lin - Someone Like You (by Adele)]&lt;/ref&gt; who herself entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_jpXNEu0dE Lea Huang-Remember (by A-Mei）]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for ‘The most beautiful harmonies’ (最美和聲). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist.  A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [歌唱實力精英角逐比賽]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [至少還有你], by [[Sandy Lam]], and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, "I am impressed that there is now a ''[[Million Star]]''-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance - an accomplished dream." They also have a brother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWRI9Swjpos A-Lin released the third album "In the past, in the future" and received their good wishes from relatives and friends VCR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def2XWeRiXg SS Little Swallows Night 2013-01-14 A-Lin、Lea and her mother part 1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1 July 2007, A-Lin married [[Huang Kan-lin]], a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: "At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song "How Do I Live" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr4kbVNB5rk Live LeAnn Rimes - How Do I Live]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[LeAnn Rimes]] in her Tainan Pub Session.  However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote “Good Do A-Lin " on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXCpR6_OUU0 Little Swallow Night 2011-11-25 pt.1/3 Dingdang A-Lin ]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song " 愛情問怎麼走 (How Love Will Go)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORYmdlbJjM I love Heisehui-A Taiwanese variety show_1_(2007 Jul 5)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">'''Acting under a description''' is a conception of the [[intentionality]] of human action introduced by philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].

==G. E. M. Anscombe==
Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question "Why?", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (''Intention'', par. 5-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gertrude |last=Anscombe |author-link=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Intention |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent can answer the "Why?" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. "To do Y" or "because I want to do Y" would be typical answers to this sort of "Why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Moreover, the act is known without observation (''Intention'', section. 28). For example, a person knows without observation that their hands are pushing upwards and when asked what they are doing, they say they are opening the window. Hence, in their hands pushing upwards, they are opening the window; opening a window being a description of the intentional act.

Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description "pumping water" but not under other descriptions such as "contracting these muscles", "tapping out this rhythm", etc.

==Ian Hacking==
The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by [[Ian Hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ian |last=Hacking |author-link=Ian Hacking |title=Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows: people talk about themselves as intentional beings. Descriptions of acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. A person offers an explanation of why he or she acts thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts.

Acting under a description has important implications for interpreting our selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and the kind of person that commits the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hacking |first=Ian |year= 2007 |title=Kinds of People: Moving Targets |periodical=PROCEEDINGS-BRITISH ACADEMY |volume=151 |pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Curran |first=R |year=1997 |title=HACKING, IAN. Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personalities and the Sciences of Memory |periodical=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=174–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer "to show who's boss", "because I have ADHD", or "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.

According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be.

Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. "In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever-shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lynch |first=M |year=1995 |title=Review Symposium on Ian Hacking: Narrative Hooks and Paper Trails: the Writing of Memory |periodical=History of the Human Sciences |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxiety buffer disruption theory''' (ABDT) is an application of [[terror management theory]] to explain an individual's reaction to a traumatic event, which leads to [[post traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="mainpaper"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P. (2011). Anxiety buffer disruption theory: A terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping, 24(1), 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Terror management theory posits that humans, unlike any other organism, are uniquely aware that death is the inevitable outcome of life. When thoughts of death are made salient, such as when a terrorist attack carries those thoughts into the level of consciousness, humans are subject to debilitating anxiety unless it can be "buffered." Humans respond to the anxiety and dread [[mortality salience]] produces by clinging  to their [[World view|cultural worldview]], through [[self-esteem]] and also [[Interpersonal relationship|close personal relationships]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, C. &amp; Landau, M. (2005) Communication and terrorism: a terror management theory perspective. Communication Research Reports. Vol. 22 Nos 1–4 pages 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural worldviews, with their cultural norms, religious beliefs and moral values infuse life with meaning. They give life a feeling of normalcy and also a feeling of control. There is no way to definitely prove one's cultural world view, there they are fragile human constructs and must be maintained. Clinging to a cultural worldview and self-esteem buffer the anxiety connected to thoughts of mortality.&lt;ref name="luo"&gt;Luo, S., Shi, Z., Yang, X., Wang., X. &amp; Han, S. (2014) Reminders of mortality decrease midcingulate activity in response to others' suffering. SCAN (9) 477–486.&lt;/ref&gt; When thoughts of death are salient, humans are drawn to their cultural world view which "stipulates appropriate social requirements, and standards for valued conduct, while instilling one's life with meaning, order and permanence." &lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

When a traumatic experience cannot be assimilated into a currently held cultural worldview, the anxiety-buffering mechanisms are disrupted.&lt;ref name="edmonson"&gt;Edmondson, D., Chaudoir, S. R., Mills, M. A., Park, C. L., Holub, J., &amp; Bartkowiak, J. M. (2011). From shattered assumptions to weakened worldviews: Trauma symptoms signal anxiety buffer disruption. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16(4), 358–385.&lt;/ref&gt; ABDT argues that individuals face overwhelming anxiety which leads to the symptoms of PTSD including re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, avoidance and disassociation.&lt;ref name="ABDT"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P. Anxiety buffer disruption theory: a terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping. Vol 24. No. 1, Jan. 2011, 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samandmaxfield"&gt;Abdollahi, A., Maxfield, M., Pyszczynski, T, &amp; Luxzezynski, A. Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy. 2011, Vol. 3, Nov. 4, 329–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissociation causes atypical responses to mortality salience compared with individuals who do not suffer from an anxiety buffer disruption &lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; When the anxiety buffer disruption is mild, exaggerated coping responses, such as rejecting or taking offense at other cultures, is expected. When the anxiety buffer disruption is severe, there can be a total breakdown of coping mechanisms.&lt;ref name="studyone"&gt;Abdollahi, A., Pyszczynski, T., Maxfield, M., &amp; Luszczynska, A. (2011). Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: Dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 3(4), 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Tom Pyszczynski]] and  Pelin Kesebir.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

== Origins ==

=== Shattered assumption theory ===
In 1992, Janoff-Bulman delineated a theory of trauma response ([[Shattered Assumptions Theory]]). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about the world in which they live, based on the belief that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that the individual has self-worth.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;Mills, M. (2010) Shattered assumptions? A prospective study: The impact of trauma of global beliefs and adjustment. Doctoral Dissertations. Paper AAI3447452. http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/AAI3447452.&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered.&lt;ref name="mills" /&gt; The world is no longer benevolent or predictable.
Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further.

=== Anxiety buffer disruption theory ===
Anxiety buffer disruption theory not only focuses on the thoughts and emotions of an individual, but it also studies the behavior that results when terror management theory and shattered assumptions theory are examined together.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Excessive anxiety experienced by post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers occurs because the events causing the post-traumatic stress disorder have demonstrated to these individuals that anxiety-buffering mechanisms are not capable of protecting them from death.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; Individuals who have high levels of [[dissociation (psychology)|peritraumatic dissociation]] and low levels of [[self-efficacy]] coping, two indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder,  have abnormal responses to reminders of death. These individuals in turn do not utilize the coping mechanisms that are typically used to remove the fear of death: culture, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. In fact, in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder, mortality salience coping mechanisms are viewed as worthless and perhaps are even seen to be detestable.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt;

=== Components of anxiety buffers ===

* '''Cultural Worldview''':  Individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder will often reject their culture when provided with mortality salience triggers, the direct opposite of what terror management theory demonstrates to be true in those without post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt; Cultural worldviews infuse life with structure, purpose and meaning. People maintain these fragile constructions by preferring the company of the like-minded. But when faced with a traumatic event, there are times when the horror cannot be assimilated into the framework of the person's existing cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;
* '''Self-Esteem''': Various studies demonstrate that individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder also have decreased self-esteem. Self-esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; High self-esteem can displace defensive responses and buffer against the terror of mortality salience because it is a signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system. PTSD is related to a breakdown in this system, and noted that veterans with past and present, or ongoing PTSD have shown to have lower self-esteem. According to ABDT this leaves this group particularly vulnerable to anxiety, since self-worth is an integral part of the individual’s anxiety- buffering mechanism. [1]
* '''Close Relationships''': It is often mentioned that worldview and self-esteem affect ways in which our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. Close relationships also serve as a regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that close relationships played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of close relationships in Terror Management Theories.&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;Florian, V., Mikulincer, M., &amp; Hirschberger, G. (2002). The anxiety-buffering function of close relationships: evidence that relationship commitment acts as a terror management mechanism. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82(4), 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Close relationships seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people’s genes through their offspring. Therefore, close relationships increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers.&lt;ref name="buss"&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological review, 100(2), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization.&lt;ref name="maslow"&gt;Maslow, A. H., Frager, R., &amp; Cox, R. (1970). Motivation and personality (Vol. 2). J. Fadiman, &amp; C. McReynolds (Eds.). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation and maintenance of close relationships have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from close relationships. Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of close relationships may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Close relationships appear to have inoculating power against basic existential threats, which allows people to respond to these threats by fulfilling relational potentials. Second, it seems the sense of relationship commitment is shaped by not only perceived relational investment, gains, and potential alternatives, as well as the existential need of denial of death awareness. Third, it seems processes of terror management not only include worldview defenses to protect the self, but also promote commitment to significant others and the expansion of the self, provided by these relationships.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

An important finding is that close relationships may serve as a fundamental anxiety buffer. It appears close relationships not only protect individuals from concrete and actual threats or danger, but also offers a symbolic shield against the awareness of one’s finitude. Since the threat of death is inescapable, the support from those close to us make may make the thought of death more tolerable by giving meaning to our lives by being important to others.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

As other anxiety buffers, interpersonal relationships are damaged as well in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder. People with post traumatic stress disorder have higher rates of divorce, more difficulty with their children, are more prone to domestic violence, and are emotionally distant from loved ones. All of these are damaging and as a result, terror management cannot be accomplished through close interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt;

== Anxiety buffer disruption theory studies ==

=== Posttraumatic stress reactions ===
A study looked at dissociation responses and PTSD in students who survived the [[2005 Zarand earthquake]] in Iran. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,500 people and displaced more than 6,700 for two months or more. It looked at dissociation one month later then two years later to see if level of dissociation predicted PTSD.

Four weeks after the earthquake, researchers solicited for volunteers at local universities. All of the participants met the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] criterion for a Class A1 trauma. Many were wearing black mourning clothes or had injuries from the earthquake.

Three priming conditions were employed: mortality salience, earthquake or dental pain. The researchers then evaluated  how the subjects felt toward foreign aid in the wake of the disaster. The results indicated that subjects with high dissociative tendencies showed no effect of mortality salience on attitudes toward the foreign aid. Subjects with low dissociative tendencies reacted as terror management theory predicts when confronted with mortality salience and thought of the earthquake.

Two years after the quake, the researchers returned and 172 of the original respondents participated. They predicted that subjects with high PTSD symptoms would have a disrupted worldview on both foreign aid and the [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress code]]. They found a strong relationship between dissociation and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Even after the passage of two years, subjects with high dissociative tendencies were still not defending against existential threats in a way typical for the population who has not experienced trauma.&lt;ref name="studyone"/&gt;

=== Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity ===
105 students of the University of Abidjan took the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version and then an opinion survey on the civil war in [[Cote d'Ivoire]]. Last, they took part in a word-completion task designed to measure their accessibility of death-related thoughts. This study, unlike previous studies related to terror management theory, looked at the subjects' thoughts of death as related to the war, a specific traumatic event.

In the [[Scientific control|control condition]], where subjects were asked to talk about their anxiety related to their worst exam, death thought accessibility was lower for those with higher levels of PTSD. This suggests that people suffering from strong PTSD repress thoughts of death. But when mortality was made salient, it provoked a marked increase in death thought accessibility for those with high PTSD. The results indicate that the anxiety buffer of death thought suppression under normal circumstances failed when subjects were reminded of the traumatic event.

A second experiment was conducted with 197 students of the University of Ajidjan where they evaluated exposure (proximity) to a traumatic event. In this case, it was geographical location to the civil war. The researchers hypothesized that subjects who lived where the fighting was more constant and intense would be more likely to increase their PTSD reports when mortality was made salient. Those who lived in an area of less conflict should not increase their reports of PTSD. As a form of defensive denial, the researchers predicted they might report lower levels of symptoms. As expected, subjects who had more exposure to war reported greater PTSD symptoms in the mortality salience condition.&lt;ref name="tard"&gt;Chatard, A., Pyszczynski, T., Arndt, J., Selimbegović, L., Konan, P. N., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2012). Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity as predictors of anxiety-buffer functioning. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 4(1), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;Gilman, T.T., Marcuse, F.L. and Moore, A.U., (1960). Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens. Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology, 43: 99-111&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in [[sharks]] exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"&gt;Henningsen, A.D., (1994).  Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry. Zoo Biology 13: 325-332. {{doi|10.1002/zoo.1430130406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.&lt;ref name="Jones 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watsky, M.A., and Gruber, S.H. (1990) Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 8: 207-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davie, P.S., Franklin, C.E., and Grigg, G.C. (1993) Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 12: 95-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, M.R., Dill, L.M., Marshall, G.J., and Buhleier, B. (2002) Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem. Marine Biology 140: 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, K.N., Wetherbee, B.M., owe, C.G., and Meyer, C.G. (1999) Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters. Marine Biology 134: 665-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. SCOPUS. Web. 22 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2 in: Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt; [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F.T. (1977) Induction and duration of tonic immobility. The Psychological Record 27: 89-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J.C. (1991) Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens. Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences 6: 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In marine mammals===
In 1997, it was reported that around the [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]], a female [[orca]] was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a [[great white shark]]. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.

Another case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with [[stingrays]] in [[New Zealand]]. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves.  This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Channel "The Whale That Ate Jaws" 11/29/2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.&lt;ref name="Prestrude"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.&lt;ref name="Hennig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rabbits===
In [[rabbit]]s, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing.&lt;ref name="McBride et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |doi= |url= http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013|display-authors=etal}} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name="McBride et al." /&gt;

===In humans===
Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While "freezing" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common "freeze" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/galliano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ Why many rape victims don’t fight or yell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning.

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.&lt;ref name="Gallup et al., 1970"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970). Effect of varying conditions of fear on immobility reactions in domestic chickens (Gallus gullus).  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 73: 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallup, 1979"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., (1979).  Tonic immobility as a measure of fear in the domestic fowl.  Animal Behaviour, 27: 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"&gt;Jones, B. and Faure, J.M. (1981). Tonic immobility ("righting time") in laying hens housed in cages and pens. Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;Forkman, B., Boissy, A. Meunier-Salaün, M.-C. Canali, E. and Jones, R.B., (2007). A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses.  Physiology &amp; Behavior, 92: 340-374&lt;/ref&gt;

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009"&gt;Zamudio, S.R., Quevedo-Corona, L., Garcés, L. and De La Cruz, F. (2009).  The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats.  Brain Research Bulletin, 80: 331-336&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"/&gt; hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels,&lt;ref name="Jones, 1987"&gt;Jones, R.B., (1987).  Fearfulness of caged laying hens: The effects of cage level and type of roofing.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 17: 171-175&lt;/ref&gt; hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor,&lt;ref name="Scott and Moran, 1993"&gt;Scott, G.B. and Moran, P., (1993).  Fear levels in laying hens carried by hand and by mechanical conveyors. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 36: 337-345&lt;/ref&gt; and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.&lt;ref name="Cashman et al., 1989"&gt;Cashman P., Nicol, C.J. and Jones, R.B. (1989).  Effects of transportation on the tonic immobility fear reactions of broilers. British Poultry Science, 30: 211-221&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.&lt;ref name=Pasteur /&gt;

===For defense===
For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;Pasteur, G. (1982). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 A classificatory review of mimicry systems]". ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''13''': 169–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,&lt;ref name="beetle"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive? Heritable variation in fitness difference of death-feigning behaviour|journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume = 271|pages = 2293–2296|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2858|pmid=15539355|last6=Mizumoto|first6=M|issue=1554|pmc=1691851|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&amp;id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways. Some biologists believe that many die as they feed on road-killed animals – a favorite food. Others believe that the opossums’ small brain (5 times smaller than that of a raccoon) suggests that they may just be too dumb to get out of the way of vehicles!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H. Leaich |year = 2006|title = Variation in propensity to exhibit thanatosis in ''Nasonia vitripennis'' (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)|journal = Journal of Insect Behaviour|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 241–249|doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9022-7|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.3100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cricket, ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nishino|first = H.|year = 2004|title = Motor output characterizing thanatosis in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal = Journal of Experimental Behaviour|volume =207|issue = 22|pages = 3899–3915|doi=10.1242/jeb.01220|pmid = 15472021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene S. Helfman |author2=Bruce B. Collette |author3=Douglas E. Facey |title =The diversity of fishes|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell|year =1997|page=324|isbn =978-0-86542-256-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKaye, K.R. (1981) Field observation on death feigning: a unique hunting behavior by the predatory cichlid, ''Haplochromis livingstonii'', of Lake Malawi. Environmental Biology of Fishes 6: 361-365.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid ''[[Lamprologus lemairii]]'' from [[Lake Tanganyika]] &lt;ref&gt;Lucanus, O. (1998) Darwin’s pond: Malawi and Tanganyika. Tropical Fish Hobbyist 47: 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid ''[[Parachromis friedrichsthalii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, M.

This article describes organizations that promote [[Artificial life]].

==International Society of Artificial Life==
'''ISAL''' is a "democratic, international, professional society dedicated to promoting scientific research and education relating to artificial life, including sponsoring conferences, publishing scientific journals and newsletters, and maintaining web sites related to artificial life",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alife.org/mission.html Artificial Life - Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227045021/http://www.alife.org/mission.html |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally incorporated in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://alife.org/sites/default/files/ISAL-articles-010509.pdf ISAL ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation, ISAL has taken over organizing professional conferences on artificial life, alternating each year between the ''International Conference on Artificial Life'' in even years and the ''European Conference on Artificial Life'' in odd years. Each conference is uniquely identified with a Roman numeral.

The current president of ISAL is [[Charles Ofria]] from Michigan State University.  From 2001-2015, the president of ISAL was [[Mark Bedau]].  The ISAL board of directors currently contains 9 elected members and 5 appointed members to carry out specific roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://alife.org/board-members ISAL board members&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISAL also publishes the preeminent artificial life scholarly journal ''[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]]'' through [[MIT Press]].

==Biota.org==
'''Biota.org''' is run by [[Tom Barbalet]], and "promotes and assists the engineering of complete, biologically-inspired, synthetic ecosystems and organisms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/about/ Biota.org: About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Biota.org ran an annual Digital Biota Conference Series from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/ Biota.org: The Artificial Life Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Biota.org has hosted a "collection of interviews, conference lectures and conversations with artificial life developers, academics and users" through a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/podcast/ Biota.org: Podcast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey Thumb Society==
The '''Grey Thumb Society''' was a group of "scientists, engineers, hackers, artists, and hobbyists... with a strong interest in artificial life, artificial intelligence, biology, complex systems, and other related topics". Grey Thumb societies appeared around the world but by 2011 most of the groups' activities had wound down.

[[File:Babesia life cycle human en.svg|thumb|240px|Life cycle of the single-celled parasite ''[[Babesia]]''.]]
In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state. "The concept is closely related to those of the life history, [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[ontogeny]], but differs from them in stressing renewal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/55494?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103764585297 |author1=Graham Bell  |author2=Vassiliki Koufopanou  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The architecture of the life cycle in small organisms |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |year=1991 |volume=332 |issue=1262 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitions of form may involve growth, [[asexual reproduction]], or [[sexual reproduction]].

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.&lt;ref name="Dixon73"&gt;Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver &amp; Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are 3 types of cycles:
*'''''haplontic''''' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*'''''diplontic''''' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*'''''haplodiplontic''''' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. '''Zygotic meiosis''' and '''gametic meiosis''' have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed '''haplobiontic''' (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). '''Sporic meiosis''', on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed '''diplobiontic''' (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A '''zygotic meiosis''' is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are '''haplonts''', hence this life cycle is also called '''haplontic life cycle'''. Haplonts are:

Cambridge University Press (623 pp).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In '''gametic meiosis''', instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a '''diplont''', hence a gametic meiosis is also called a '''diplontic life cycle'''. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acetabularia]]''&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;)
* In [[stramenopiles]]: some [[brown algae]] (the [[Fucales]], however, their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic, with a highly reduced gametophyte phase, as in the [[flowering plants]]),&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al.

(1995), pp. 124, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; most [[diatom]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; some [[oomycete]]s (e.g., ''[[Saprolegnia]]'', ''[[Plasmopara viticola]]''),&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt; [[opaline]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert"&gt;Ruppert, E.

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In '''sporic meiosis''' (also commonly known as '''intermediary meiosis'''), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt;

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''Bonnemaisonia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tejp/2009/00000044/00000003/art00012|title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula|first1=Noemi|last1=Salvador Soler|first2=Amelia|last2=Gomez Garreta|first3=M.|last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan|date=1 August 2009|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=381–393|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/09670260902780782}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have '''vegetative meiosis''', also called '''somatic meiosis''', which is a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al. (1995), pp. 82, 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called '''vegetative diploidization''', a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, R.J.|year=1996|title=Chromosomes of the brown algae|journal=Phycologia|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19–40|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many  [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

'''Biotic potential'''  is described by the unrestricted growth of populations resulting in the maximum growth of that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Gary|title=Living with the Earth, Third Edition: Concepts in Environmental Health Science|page=38|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Biotic potential is the highest possible vital index of a species; therefore, when the species has its highest birthrate and lowest mortality rate.

==Quantitative Expression==

The biotic potential is the quantitative expression of the ability of a species to face selection in any environment. The main equilibrium of a particular population is described by the equation:

:Number of Individuals = Biotic Potential/Resistance of the Environment (Biotic and Abiotic)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman also relates to a "vital index", regarding a ratio to find the rate of surviving members of a species, whereas;
:Vital Index = (number of births/number of deaths)*100

==Components==

According to the ecologist R.N Chapman (1928), the biotic potential could be divided into a reproductive and survival potential. The survival potential could in turn be divided into nutritive and protective potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Ancona|first1=Umberto|title=The Struggle for Existence|page=227|accessdate=8 July 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive potential (potential [[natality]]) is the upper limit to biotic potential in the absence of mortality. Survival potential is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[Death|mortality]]. Because reproductive potential does not account for the number of gametes surviving, survival potential is a necessary component of biotic potential. In the absence of mortality, biotic potential = reproductive potential.

Chapman also identified two additional components of nutritive and protective potentials as divisions of the survival potential. Nutritive potential is the ability to acquire and use food for growth and energy. Protective potential is described by the ability of the organism to protect itself against the dynamic forces of environment in order to insure successful reproduction and offspring.

Full expression of the biotic potential of an organism is restricted by environmental resistance, any condition that inhibits the increase in number of the population. It is generally only reached when environmental conditions are very favorable. A species reaching its biotic potential would exhibit exponential [[population growth]] and be said to have a high [[fertility]], that is, how many offspring are produced per mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nebel|first1=Bernard|last2=Wright|first2=Richard|title=Environmental Science: The Way the World Works|page=73|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Zones''' are regions of the world where [[Dan Buettner]] claims people live much longer than average. The term first appeared in the November 2005 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover story "The Secrets of a Long Life" by Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/|title=Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life - National Geographic Magazine|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified five areas where: [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] ([[Japan]]); [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]); [[Nicoya Peninsula|Nicoya]] ([[Costa Rica]]); [[Icaria]] ([[Greece]]) and among the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. He offers an explanation, based on data and first hand observations, as to why these populations live healthier and longer lives. The term "Blue Zones" is [[trademarked]] by Dan Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Adventurer Discovered The Secrets To Long Life — And It Could Save Iowa $16 Billion By 2016 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dan-buettner-blue-zone-iowa-2012-8 |accessdate=5 November 2018 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the Blue Zone. Together with demographers Pes and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], Buettner broadened the term, applying it to validated longevity areas of Okinawa, Japan and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California.  Buettner and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], under the aegis of National Geographic, then identified and validated longevity hotspots in Nicoya, Costa Rica and Icaria, Greece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">The '''death coach''' is part of the [[folklore]] of north western Europe. It is particularly strong in Ireland but is also found in British and American culture. In Irish folklore, it is known as the '''''Cóiste Bodhar''''' {{IPA-ga|ˈkoːʃtʲə ˈbˠəuɾˠ}}, meaning deaf or silent coach, and it is said that the sight or sound of the coach is the [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of death. It warns of imminent death to either oneself or to a close relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/folklore/folklore_survey/chapter3.htm|title=A Folklore Survey of County Clare: The Death Coach|last=Westropp|first=Thomas Johnson|authorlink=Thomas Johnson Westropp|publisher=Clare County Library|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland in particular the Death Coach is seen as a signifier of the inevitability of death, as the belief goes once it has come to Earth it can never return empty.  Thus, once the death of an individual has been decided by a greater power, mortals may do nothing to prevent it.

The driver of the Cóiste Bodhar is said to be a headless horseman, called the [[Dullahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pararesearchers.org/Ghosts/coachabower/coachabower.html|title=The Coach-A-Bower|last=Tyrrell|first=Jennifer|publisher=Para-Researchers of Ontario|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cóiste Bodhar is mentioned by [[W. B. Yeats]] in his collection ''Folk tales of Ireland.''&lt;ref name="Raine1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raine|first=Kathleen|title=Yeats the initiate: essays on certain themes in the work of W.B. Yeats|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zJ5jDUwgJFQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33|accessdate=15 September 2010|year=1990|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-389-20951-5|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scottish folklore, a death coach is said to be seen at times on the [[Royal Mile]] of [[Edinburgh]], where it collects the souls of the dead. Also in Scotland a "hell wain" can supposedly be seen in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hell (n.)|publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=hell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cóiste Bodhar has been portrayed in the film ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/articles.php?art=ww080312ws|title=The Magic of Darby O'Gill (Wade's Wayback Machine)|last=Sampson|first=Wade|date=March 12, 2008|publisher=MousePlanet|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cóiste Bodhar also appeared in ''[[Strange (TV series)|Strange]]'' along with the [[Banshee]] who is able to summon the Coach.

The Cóiste Bodhar has also been featured in the Japanese [[light novel]] series ''[[Durarara!!]]''. It serves as the steed of the Dullahan Celty Sturluson and it can shapeshift into anything ranging from a headless horse to a motorcycle.

At the end of Stephen King's novel ''[[Needful Things]]'', the story's antagonist, shop owner Leland (in some printings "Leeland") Gaunt, reveals himself to be a diabolical figure and departs the town of Castle Rock in an automobile that transforms into a death coach emblazoned with the motto ''[[Caveat emptor]]'' ("May the buyer beware").

Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is "the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected".&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

[[File:Sudden Death graph.png|thumb|Illustration of the premature death trajectory. There is a sharp decline in human function in a short period of time.|205x205px]]
Dying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |title=Trajectory of Dying |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306060758/http://www.fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudden death trajectory==
Sudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and [[unnatural death|unexpectedly die]] without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like [[myocardial infarction]] or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.

==Chronic malady trajectory==
[[File:Length of Dying Process.png|thumb|A chronic malady trajectory showing an overall decline in health with intermittent rises and falls in human function.|left|187x187px]]The chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[HIV]] or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by [[Recrudescence|acute crises]] and intermittent [[Cure#Remission|recoveries]].&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil;&lt;ref name=one /&gt; the patient may eventually become [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|mentally]] and [[emotional exhaustion|emotionally exhausted]].

==Natural death trajectory==
[[File:Steady decline.png|thumb|A typical natural death trajectory chronicling a long, steady decline in health over time.]]
A natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to [[aging-associated diseases|old age]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolejs, Josef; Marešová, Petra. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268335/ "Onset of mortality increase with age and age trajectories of mortality from all diseases in the four Nordic countries"], ''[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerstorf|first1=Denis|last2=Ram|first2=Nilam|last3=Lindenberger|first3=Ulman|last4=Smith|first4=Jacqui|title=Age and time-to-death trajectories of change in indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related functions|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1805–1821|doi=10.1037/a0031340|pmid=23356526|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0024-EC54-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical care==
When someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide [[palliative care|palliative]] or comfort care.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life.

The '''Dorian Gray syndrome''' ('''DGS''') denotes a cultural and societal [[phenomenon]] characterized by a man's extreme [[pride]] in his personal appearance and the fitness of his physique, which is accompanied by difficulties in coping with the requirements of psychological maturation and with the [[aging]] of his body.

The DGS is characterized by a triad of symptoms that overlap, and so combine [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] signs of [[dysmorphophobia]], [[narcissistic]] character traits, and the immaturity of arrested development, which often are found in [[paraphilias]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Gieler et al. eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve ephemeral youth, the man afflicted with DGS tends to consume cosmetic products and services, hair-restoration procedures, anti-impotence drugs, and [[cosmetic surgery]]; hence, he might resist the [[psychosomatic]] and [[psychodynamic]] explanations of the [[syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 47 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Dorian Gray syndrome" refers to the protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), an exceptionally handsome man whose [[hedonism]] and [[Narcissism|excessive self-love]] proved detrimental to the personal, social, and emotional aspects of his life, and who sought to escape the ravages of time and his own decadent lifestyle by having a supernatural portrait of himself age in his place.

==History==
[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The portraitist Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton observe the beauty recorded in the picture of Dorian Gray.]]
The DGS was first described in ''The Dorian Gray Syndrome: Psychodynamic Need for Hair growth Restorers and other "fountains of youth"'' (2001), in a symposium about the unrealistic male pursuit of bodily [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]] — by means of lifestyle-enhancing drugs, aesthetic surgery, and psychotropic medicines — and its consequences for his mental health as a social being.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig 2000, Brosig ''et al.'' 2001, Euler 2003 ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The culturally descriptive name of the syndrome refers to the eponymous protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), by Oscar Wilde, the story of a very handsome young man who much admires and envies the just-completed portrait of himself, and wishes that it would grow old, rather than he. In order to resist the physical corruptions of time and nature, and unable and unwilling to mature, Dorian Gray "gives his soul away", and his wish is granted.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil portrait and the narrative of the novel transgress and cite [[narcissistic]] mirror motives; as such, eternal beauty, aging, and maturation are represented with the psychological dyad of "the person and the mirror". The personal character of the man Dorian Gray is the background for the clinical description of the Dorian Gray [[syndrome]] that afflicts the patient.

==Causes==
The Dorian Gray syndrome arises from the concurring and overlapping clinical concepts of the [[narcissistic personality]], [[dysmorphophobia]], and [[Paraphilias|paraphilia]]. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamically]], the man afflicted with DGS presents an interplay among his narcissistic tendencies ("timeless beauty"), his arrested development (inability to psychologically mature), and his use of "medical lifestyle" products and services — hair restoration, drugs (for [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], weight-loss, and mood modification), laser dermatology, and plastic surgery — in order to remain young.

Although the DGS patient displays diagnostic features of said mental disorders, the syndrome describes a common, underlying psychodynamics of mental illness, which is characterized by [[narcissistic defences]] against time-dependent maturation, expressed by actively seeking the timeless beauty of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boese, ''Hippo Eats Dwarf'' (2010) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The article ''Das Dorian Gray syndrom'' (2005) reported that approximately 3.0 per cent of the population of Germany present features of the Dorian Gray syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig, B., Euler, S., Brähler, E., Gieler, U. (2005) "Das Dorian Gray Syndrom", in Trüeb, R. A. (Hg.): Smart aging. Darmstadt, Steinkopff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for Dorian Gray syndrome are:
* Signs of [[dysmorphophobia]]
* Arrested development (inability to mature)
* Using at least two different medical-lifestyle products and services:
** Hair-growth restoration (e.g. [[Antiandrogen|finasteride]])
** Antiadiposita to lose weight (e.g. [[orlistat]])
** [[Erectile Dysfunction|Anti-impotence drugs]]  (e.g. [[sildenafil]])
** Anti-depressant drugs (e.g. [[fluoxetine]])
** [[Cosmetology|Cosmetic]] [[dermatology]] (e.g. laser resurfacing)
** [[Cosmetic surgery]] (e.g. a face-lift, [[liposuction]])

==Sequelae==
Episodes of [[major depressive disorder]] and of [[suicidal]] [[crisis]] occur in the man afflicted with Dorian Gray syndrome when the [[defense mechanism]] activities, the pursuit of eternal youth, fail to indefinitely preserve his handsome face and sculpted physique; usually, anti-depressant drugs and psychotherapy are prescribed and applied to counter his feelings of failure.&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, if the man misunderstands the self-defensive character of "acting out" the DGS, and continues pursuing the timeless beauty of male youth, without being aware of the psychodynamics of narcissism, then he, as a psychiatric patient, establishes a cycle of chronic [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]]. In extreme cases of DGS, the man seeks self-destruction, by means either of [[Medication|drugs]] or with plastic surgery, or both, in order to fill the narcissistic emptiness that is the Dorian Gray syndrome.

'''Fertilisation''' or '''fertilization''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|spelling differences]]), also known as '''generative fertilisation''', '''insemination''', '''pollination''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fertilization |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''fecundation''', '''syngamy''' and '''impregnation''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/impregnation{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the fusion of [[gametes]] to initiate the development of a new individual [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{], or outside ([[external fertilization|external fertilisation]])&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called [[sexual reproduction]]. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to      form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.

==History==
In Antiquity, [[Aristotle]] conceived the formation of new individuals through fusion of male and female fluids, with form and function emerging gradually, in a mode called by him as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenetic]].&lt;ref name=Maienschein&gt;Maienschein J. 2017. The first century of cell theory: From structural units to complex living systems. In: Stadler F. (eds.), ''Integrated History and Philosophy of Science. Vienna Circle Institute Yearbook''.

[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=zRgnDwAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, [[Spallanzani]] established the need of interaction between the female's ovum and male's sperm to form a zygote in frogs.&lt;ref name=Birkhead/&gt; In 1827, von Baer observed a mammalian egg for the first time.&lt;ref name=Maienschein/&gt; [[Oscar Hertwig]] (1876), in Germany, described the fusion of nuclei of spermatozoa and of ova from [[sea urchin]].&lt;ref name="Birkhead"&gt;Birkhead, T.R. &amp; Montgomerie, R. (2009). Three centuries of sperm research, pp 1-42 in: Birkhead, T. R., Hosken, D. J. &amp; Pitnick, S. ''Sperm Biology: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam. 642 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kctYNbO1fE0C].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of fertilisation is related to the [[Origin and function of meiosis|origin of meiosis]], as both are part of [[sexual reproduction]], originated in [[eukaryote]]s. There are two conflicting theories on how the couple meiosis–fertilisation arose. One is that it evolved from prokaryotic sex ([[bacterial recombination]]) as eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2011"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair | first1 = Harris | last1 = Bernstein | first2 = Carol | last2 = Bernstein   | first3 = Richard E. | last3 = Michou | name-list-format = vanc  | editor-first1 = Inna | editor-last1 = Kruman | title = DNA repair | chapter = Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair | year = 2011 | publisher = InTech | doi = 10.5772/1751|isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is that [[mitosis]] originated meiosis.&lt;ref name="Wilkins_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkins AS, Holliday R | title = The evolution of meiosis from mitosis | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19139151 | pmc = 2621177 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.099762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertilisation in plants==
[[File:DEV035048A.jpg|thumb|In the [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]]. This [[moss]] has been [[GUS reporter system|genetically modified]] so that the unfertilised egg within the archegonium produces a blue colour.]]&lt;p&gt;The gametes that participate in fertilisation of plants are the pollen (male), and the egg (female) cell.  Various families of plants have differing methods by which the female gametophyte is fertilized.  In [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]].  In [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]] a second fertilisation event involves another sperm cell and the [[central cell]] which is a second female gamete. In flowering plants there are two sperm from each pollen grain.&lt;/p&gt;In [[Seed plant|seed plants]], after [[pollination]], a [[pollen]] grain [[Pollen germination|germinates]], and a [[pollen tube]] grows and penetrates the [[ovule]] through a tiny pore called a [[Ovule|micropyle]]. The sperm are transferred from the pollen through the pollen tube to the ovule.

'''Pollen tube growth'''

Unlike animal sperm which is motile, plant sperm is immotile and relies on the pollen tube to carry it to the ovule where the sperm is released.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms4129 |title=Reactive oxygen species mediate pollen tube rupture to release sperm for fertilization in Arabidopsis |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |last1=Duan |first1=Qiaohong |last2=Kita |first2=Daniel |last3=Johnson |first3=Eric A |last4=Aggarwal |first4=Mini |last5=Gates |first5=Laura |last6=Wu |first6=Hen-Ming |last7=Cheung |first7=Alice Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pollen tube penetrates the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] and elongates through the extracellular matrix of the style before reaching the ovary.  Then near the receptacle, it breaks through the [[ovule]] through the micropyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and the pollen tube "bursts" into the embryo sac, releasing sperm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90427-1 |pmid=7634328 |title=A floral transmitting tissue-specific glycoprotein attracts pollen tubes and stimulates their growth |journal=Cell |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=383–93 |year=1995 |last1=Cheung |first1=Alice Y |last2=Wang |first2=Hong |last3=Wu |first3=Hen-Ming }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of the pollen tube has been believed to depend on chemical cues from the pistil, however these mechanisms were poorly understood until 1995.  Work done on [[Nicotiana|tobacco plants]] revealed a family of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called TTS proteins that enhanced growth of pollen tubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pollen tubes in a sugar free pollen germination medium and a medium with purified TTS proteins both grew.  However, in the TTS medium, the tubes grew at a rate 3x that of the sugar-free medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  TTS proteins were also placed on various locations of semi [[In vivo|in vevo]] pollinated pistils, and pollen tubes were observed to immediately extend toward the proteins.  Transgenic plants lacking the ability to produce TTS proteins exhibited slower pollen tube growth and reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Rupture of pollen tube'''

The rupture of the pollen tube to release sperm in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' has been shown to depend on a signal from the female gametophyte.  Specific proteins called FER protein kinases present in the ovule control the production of highly reactive derivatives of oxygen called [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/reactive-oxygen-species|title=Reactive oxygen species|last=Maejima|first=Yasuhiro|date=2012|website=Science Direct|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS levels have been shown via [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] to be at their highest during floral stages when the ovule is the most receptive to pollen tubes, and lowest during times of development and following fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    High amounts of ROS activate Calcium ion channels in the pollen tube, causing these channels to take up Calcium ions in large amounts. This increased uptake of calcium causes the pollen tube to rupture, and release its sperm into the ovule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Pistil feeding assays in which plants were fed diphenyl iodonium chloride (DPI) suppressed ROS concentrations in ''Arabidopsis'', which in turn prevented pollen tube rupture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
===Bryophytes===
Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called "non-vascular plants". Some bryophytes do have specialised tissues for the transport of water; however, since these do not contain lignin, they are not considered true vascular tissue.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Ferns===
A fern is a member of a group of roughly 12,000 species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular (i.e. having water-conducting vessels). They have stems and leaves, like other vascular plants. Most ferns have what are called fiddleheads that expand into fronds, which are each delicately divided.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Gymnosperms===
The gymnosperms are a group of seed producing plants that includes conifers, [[Cycad]]s, [[Ginkgo]], and [[Gnetales]]. The term "gymnosperm" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, "naked" and σπέρμα sperma, "seed"), meaning "naked seeds", after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilised state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in Ginkgo.

===Flowering plants===
{{main article|Double fertilisation}}

After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and develop into the [[fruit]].&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{cite book  |last1=Johnstone |first1=Adam |title=Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level |date= |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=  |isbn=0-19-914766-3 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; With multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule.  The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative (or tube) cytoplasm. Hydrolytic [[enzymes]] are secreted by the pollen tube that digest the female tissue as the tube grows down the stigma and style; the digested tissue is used as a nutrient source for the pollen tube as it grows. During pollen tube growth towards the ovary, the generative nucleus divides to produce two separate sperm nuclei (haploid number of chromosomes)&lt;ref name="handbook_of_plant_science"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of plant science |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England |isbn=978-0-470-05723-0 |page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a growing pollen tube therefore contains three separate nuclei, two sperm and one tube.&lt;ref name="biology_today_a01"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=David |last2=Starr |first2=Cecie |title=Biology today |year=1975 |publisher=CRM |location=Del Mar, Calif. |isbn=978-0-394-31093-0 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sperms are interconnected and dimorphic, the large one, in a number of plants, is also linked to the tube nucleus and the interconnected sperm and the tube nucleus form the "male germ unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raghavan |first1=Valayamghat |title=Double fertilization: embryo and endosperm development in flowering plant |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-27791-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double fertilization|Double fertilisation]] is the process in [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) in which two [[sperm]] from each pollen tube fertilise two [[cell (biology)|cells]] in a female [[gametophyte]] (sometimes called an embryo sac) that is inside an ovule. After the pollen tube enters the gametophyte, the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates and the two sperm cells are released; one of the two sperm cells ''fertilises'' the egg cell (at the bottom of the gametophyte near the micropyle), forming a [[diploid]] (2n) [[zygote]]. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs; pollination and fertilisation are two separate processes. The nucleus of the other sperm cell fuses with two haploid polar nuclei (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the gametophyte. The resulting cell is [[triploid]] (3n). This triploid cell divides through [[mitosis]] and forms the [[endosperm]], a [[nutrient]]-rich [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], inside the [[seed]].

The two central-cell maternal nuclei (polar nuclei) that contribute to the endosperm arise by mitosis from the single meiotic product that also gave rise to the egg. Therefore, maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo.

One primitive species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a sperm with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm linages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x |pmid=12683519 |title=Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=216–30 |year=2003 |last1=Friedman |first1=William E |last2=Williams |first2=Joseph H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many plants, the development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with [[watermelon]], about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.

Cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation represent different strategies with differing benefits and costs.  An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers.&lt;ref name="pmid16817548"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Igic B, Kohn JR |title=The distribution of plant mating systems: study bias against obligately outcrossing species |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=1098–103 |year=2006 |pmid=16817548 |doi= 10.1554/05-383.1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwillie C, Kalisz S, Eckert CG | year = 2005 | title = The evolutionary enigma of mixed mating systems in plants: Occurrence, theoretical explanations, and empirical evidence | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 47–79 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.091704.175539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common kind of mixed mating system, individual plants produce a single type of flower and fruits may contain self-fertilised, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types.  The transition from cross-fertilisation to self-fertilisation is the most common evolutionary transition in plants, and has occurred repeatedly in many independent lineages.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=S. I |last2=Kalisz |first2=S |last3=Slotte |first3=T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly self-fertilising.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268" /&gt;

===Self-Pollination===
{{main article|Self-pollination}}{{see also|Cleistogamy|Autogamy}}
Under circumstances where [[pollinator]]s and/or mates are rare, self-fertilisation offers the advantage of [[Reproductive success|reproductive assurance]].&lt;ref name="pmid23595268" /&gt;  Self-fertilisation can therefore result in improved colonisation ability. In some species, self-fertilisation has persisted over many generations.  ''[[Capsella rubella]]'' is a self-fertilisating species that became self-compatible 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid24068948"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003754 |pmid=24068948 |pmc=3772084 |title=Genomic Identification of Founding Haplotypes Reveals the History of the Selfing Species Capsella rubella |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=e1003754 |year=2013 |last1=Brandvain |first1=Yaniv |last2=Slotte |first2=Tanja |last3=Hazzouri |first3=Khaled M |last4=Wright |first4=Stephen I |last5=Coop |first5=Graham }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-fertilising plant with an [[Allogamy|out-crossing]] rate in the wild of less than 0.3%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = RJ | last2 = Gomes | first2 = MF | year = 1989 | title = Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Consequently, one might expect self-fertilisation to be replaced in nature by an ameiotic asexual form of reproduction that would be less costly.  However the actual persistence of meiosis and self-fertilisation as a form of reproduction in long-established self-fertilising plants may be related to the immediate benefit of efficient [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|recombinational repair]] of DNA damage during formation of germ cells provided by meiosis at each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.5772/25117 |doi-access=free |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |year=2011 |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |last3=Michod |first3=Richard E. |editor-first=Inna |editor-last=Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertilisation in animals ==
{{see also|Sexual reproduction in animals|Animal sexual behaviour}}
The mechanics behind fertilisation has been studied extensively in sea urchins and mice.  This research addresses the question of how the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and the appropriate egg find each other and the question of how only one sperm gets into the egg and delivers its contents. There are three steps to fertilisation that ensure species-specificity:

# Chemotaxis
# Sperm activation/acrosomal reaction
# Sperm/egg adhesion

=== Internal vs. external ===
Consideration as to whether an animal (more specifically a vertebrate) uses [[Internal fertilization|internal]] or [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] is often dependent on the method of birth. Oviparous animals laying eggs with thick calcium shells, such as [[chickens]], or thick leathery shells generally reproduce via internal fertilisation so that the sperm fertilises the egg without having to pass through the thick, protective, tertiary layer of the egg. [[Ovoviviparity|Ovoviviparous]] and [[viviparity|viviparous]] animals also use internal fertilisation. It is important to note that although some organisms reproduce via [[amplexus]], they may still use internal fertilisation, as with some salamanders. Advantages to internal fertilisation include: minimal waste of gametes; greater chance of individual egg fertilisation, relatively "longer" time period of egg protection, and selective fertilisation; many females have the ability to store sperm for extended periods of time and can fertilise their eggs at their own desire.

Oviparous animals producing eggs with thin tertiary membranes or no membranes at all, on the other hand, use external fertilisation methods. Advantages to external fertilisation include: minimal contact and transmission of bodily fluids; decreasing the risk of disease transmission, and greater genetic variation (especially during broadcast spawning external fertilisation methods).

=== Sea urchins ===
[[File:Acrosome reaction diagram en.svg|thumb|400px|Acrosome reaction on a sea urchin cell.]]

Sperm find the eggs via [[chemotaxis]], a type of ligand/receptor interaction. Resact is a 14 amino acid peptide purified from the jelly coat of ''A. punctulata'' that attracts the migration of sperm.

After finding the egg, the sperm penetrates the [[egg jelly|jelly coat]] through a process called sperm activation. In another ligand/receptor interaction, an oligosaccharide component of the egg binds and activates a receptor on the sperm and causes the [[acrosomal reaction]]. The acrosomal vesicles of the sperm fuse with the plasma membrane and are released. In this process, molecules bound to the acrosomal vesicle membrane, such as bindin, are exposed on the surface of the sperm.  These contents digest the jelly coat and eventually the vitelline membrane. In addition to the release of acrosomal vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of [[actin]] to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the [[acrosomal process]].

The sperm binds to the egg through another ligand reaction between receptors on the [[vitelline membrane]]. The sperm surface protein bindin, binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1.

Fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. At the site of contact, fusion causes the formation of a [[fertilization cone|fertilisation cone]].

=== Mammals ===
[[Mammal]]s internally fertilise through [[copulation]]. After a male [[male ejaculation|ejaculates]], many sperm move to the upper vagina (via contractions from the vagina) through the [[cervix]] and across the length of the [[uterus]] to meet the ovum. In cases where fertilisation occurs, the female usually [[ovulation|ovulates]] during a period that extends from hours before copulation to a few days after; therefore, in most mammals it is more common for ejaculation to precede ovulation than vice versa.

The [[capacitation|capacitated]] spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ''ampulla'' of the [[fallopian tube]]. Rheotaxis, thermotaixs and chemotaxis are known mechanisms in guiding sperm towards the egg during the final stage of sperm migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/JOE-16-0302 |pmid=27875265 |title=Oviduct: Roles in fertilization and early embryo development |journal=Journal of Endocrinology |volume=232 |issue=1 |pages=R1–R26 |year=2016 |last1=Li |first1=Shuai |last2=Winuthayanon |first2=Wipawee }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spermatozoa respond (see [[Sperm thermotaxis]]) to the temperature gradient of ~2&amp;nbsp;°C between the oviduct and the ampulla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.027 |pmid=16672171 |title=Sperm thermotaxis |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=252 |issue=1–2 |pages=115–9 |year=2006 |last1=Bahat |first1=Anat |last2=Eisenbach |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chemotaxis#Eukaryotic chemotaxis|chemotactic]] gradients of [[progesterone]] have been confirmed as the signal emanating from the [[cumulus oophorus]] cells surrounding rabbit and human oocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008211 |pmid=19997608 |pmc=2782141 |title=Molecular Mechanism for Human Sperm Chemotaxis Mediated by Progesterone |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=e8211 |year=2009 |last1=Teves |first1=Maria E |last2=Guidobaldi |first2=Hector A |last3=Uñates |first3=Diego R |last4=Sanchez |first4=Raul |last5=Miska |first5=Werner |last6=Publicover |first6=Stephen J |last7=Morales Garcia |first7=Aduén A |last8=Giojalas |first8=Laura C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitated and hyperactivated sperm respond to these gradients by changing their behaviour and moving towards the cumulus-oocyte complex.

The [[zona pellucida]], a thick layer of extracellular matrix that surrounds the egg and is similar to the role of the vitelline membrane in sea urchins, binds with the sperm. Unlike sea urchins, the sperm binds to the egg before the acrosomal reaction. [[ZP3]], a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, is responsible for egg/sperm adhesion in mice. The receptor [[galactosyltransferase]] (GalT) binds to the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the ZP3 and is important for binding with the sperm and activating the acrosome reaction. ZP3 is sufficient though unnecessary for sperm/egg binding. Two additional sperm receptors exist: a 250kD protein that binds to an oviduct secreted protein, and SED1, which independently binds to the zona.  After the acrosome reaction, the sperm is believed to remain bound to the zona pellucida through exposed ZP2 receptors. These receptors are unknown in mice but have been identified in guinea pigs.

In mammals, the binding of the spermatozoon to the GalT initiates the [[acrosome reaction]]. This process releases the [[hyaluronidase]] that digests the matrix of [[hyaluronic acid]] in the vestments around the oocyte.  Fusion between the oocyte [[plasma membrane]]s and sperm follows and allows the sperm [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the typical [[centriole]], and atypical [[centriole]] that is attached to the [[flagellum]], but not the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], to enter the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-04678-8 |title=A novel atypical sperm centriole is functional during human fertilization |journal=Nature Communications |volume=9 |year=2018 |last1=Fishman |first1=Emily L |last2=Jo |first2=Kyoung |last3=Nguyen |first3=Quynh P.

The egg "[[egg activation|activates]]" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. [[Zinc]] atoms are released during this activation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/human-eggs-spark-moment-fertilization{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Commons|Fertilization#Mammalian fertilization|Mammalian fertilization}}
This process ultimately leads to the formation of a [[diploid]] cell called a [[zygote]].  The zygote divides to form a [[blastocyst]] and, upon entering the uterus, [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the endometrium, beginning [[pregnancy]]. Embryonic implantation not in the [[uterus|uterine]] wall results in an [[ectopic pregnancy]] that can kill the mother.


In such animals as rabbits, coitus induces ovulation by stimulating the release of the pituitary hormone gonadotropin; this release greatly increases the likelihood of pregnancy.

==== Humans ====
[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|Fertilisation in humans. The sperm and ovum unite through fertilisation, creating a zygote that (over the course of 8-9 days) implants in the uterine wall, where it resides for nine months.]]
{{main article|Human fertilisation}}

The term ''conception'' commonly refers to fertilisation, which is the successful fusion of gametes to form a new organism.  Its use 'conception' by some to refer to implantation makes it a subject of [[beginning of pregnancy controversy|semantic arguments about the beginning of pregnancy]], typically in the context of the [[abortion]] debate.
&lt;!-- In a statement by the [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]] (AAPLOG), regarding the controversial [[morning-after pill]], AAPLOG claims:--&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: This is a quote for a developing section, if you have a problem with it, hide the text (like this text is) but don't remove it, until I can rework it. Sinreg, --&gt;
&lt;!--:"[Again,] one must be careful of the terminology. Many now speak of "conception" as that moment when the human blastocyst, the early ball of approximately 100 cells, implants in the mother’s uterus (womb).  The time from actual fertilisation (egg and sperm unite in the Fallopian Tube) until implantation, a period of about 7-10 days, is ignored, even though no genetic change occurs in the cells during this time period.  Many family planning specialists who have supported the terminology change can thus rationalize that the destruction of the human embryo between fertilisation and implantation should be labeled "contraception", rather than "early abortion".--&gt;
Upon [[gastrulation]], which occurs around 16 days after fertilisation, the implanted blastocyst develops three germ layers, the endoderm, the ectoderm and the mesoderm, and the genetic code of the father becomes fully involved in the development of the embryo; later twinning is impossible.  Additionally, interspecies hybrids survive only until gastrulation and cannot further develop.
However, some human developmental biology literature refers to the ''[[conceptus]]'' and such medical literature refers to the "products of conception" as the post-implantation embryo and its surrounding membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moore, K. L.  |author2=T. V. M. Persaud |year=2003 |title=The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-6974-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "conception" is not usually used in scientific literature because of its variable definition and connotation.

=== Insects ===

Insects in different groups, including the [[Odonata]] ([[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]) and the [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s) practise delayed fertilisation. Anong the Odonata, females may mate with multiple males, and store sperm until the eggs are laid. The male may hover above the female during egg-laying (oviposition) to prevent her from mating with other males and replacing his sperm; in some groups such as the darters, the male continues to grasp the female with his claspers during egg-laying, the pair flying around in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dijkstra |first=Klaas-Douwe B. |title=Field Guide to the Dragonflies of Britain and Europe |year=2006 |publisher=British Wildlife Publishing |isbn=0-9531399-4-8|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among social Hymenoptera, [[honeybee]] queens mate only on mating flights, in a short period lasting some days; a queen may mate with eight or more [[drone (bee)|drones]]. She then stores the sperm for the rest of her life, perhaps for five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waldbauer |first1=Gilbert |title=The Birder's Bug Book|date=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agriculture and Consumer Protection|title=Beekeeping in Africa: Colony life and social organization|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0104e/t0104e05.htm|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--other bees ...--&gt;

==Fertilisation in fungi==
In many [[fungi]] (except [[chytrid]]s), as in some protists, fertilisation is a two step process. First, the cytoplasms of the two gamete cells fuse (called [[plasmogamy]]), producing a [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] or [[Heterokaryon|heterokaryotic]] cell with multiple nuclei. This cell may then divide to produce dikaryotic or heterokaryotic [[hyphae]]. The second step of fertilisation is [[karyogamy]], the fusion of the nuclei to form a diploid zygote.

In [[chytrid]] fungi, fertilisation occurs in a single step with the fusion of gametes, as in animals and plants.

==Fertilisation in protists==

===Fertilisation in protozoa===
There are three types of fertilisation processes in protozoa:&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilization in protozoa and metazoan animals: cellular and molecular aspects.'' Juan J. Tarín; Antonio Cano (eds.). Springer-Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* gametogamy;
* autogamy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reproduction#Autogamy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44777/autogamy{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* gamontogamy.

===Fertilisation in algae===
Fertilisation in algae occurs by [[binary fission]]. The [[pseudopodia]] is first withdrawn and the nucleus starts dividing. When the cytoplasm is divided, the cytoplasm is also divided into two equal parts for each daughter cell. Two daughter cells are produced by one parent cell. It involves the process of [[mitosis]].{{empty section|date=September 2015}}

===Fertilisation in fungi-like protists===
{{empty section|date=March 2015}}

== Fertilisation and genetic recombination ==
[[Meiosis]] results in a random segregation of the genes that each parent contributes. Each parent organism is usually identical save for a fraction of their genes; each [[gamete]] is therefore genetically unique.  At fertilisation, parental [[chromosome]]s combine. In [[human]]s, (2²²)² = 17.6x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; chromosomally different [[zygote]]s are possible for the non-sex chromosomes, even assuming no [[chromosomal crossover]].  If crossover occurs once, then on average (4²²)² = 309x10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; genetically different zygotes are possible for every couple, not considering that crossover events can take place at most points along each chromosome.  The X and Y chromosomes undergo no crossover events{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and are therefore excluded from the calculation.  The [[mitochondrial DNA]] is only inherited from the maternal parent.

==Parthenogenesis==
{{main article|parthenogenesis}}
Organisms that normally reproduce sexually can also reproduce via [[parthenogenesis]], wherein an unfertilised female gamete produces viable offspring. These offspring may be clones of the mother, or in some cases genetically differ from her but inherit only part of her DNA. Parthenogenesis occurs in many plants and animals and may be induced in others through a chemical or electrical stimulus to the egg cell. In 2004, Japanese researchers led by [[Tomohiro Kono]] succeeded after 457 attempts to merge the [[ovum|ova]] of two mice by blocking certain proteins that would normally prevent the possibility; the resulting embryo normally developed into a mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02402 |pmid=15103378 |laysummary=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0421_040421_whoneedsmales.html |laysource=National Geographic |laydate=2004-04-21 |title=Birth of parthenogenetic mice that can develop to adulthood |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6985 |pages=860–4 |year=2004 |last1=Kono |first1=Tomohiro |last2=Obata |first2=Yayoi |last3=Wu |first3=Quiong |last4=Niwa |first4=Katsutoshi |last5=Ono |first5=Yukiko |last6=Yamamoto |first6=Yuji |last7=Park |first7=Eun Sung |last8=Seo |first8=Jeong-Sun |last9=Ogawa |first9=Hidehiko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allogamy and autogamy==
[[Allogamy]], which is also known as cross-fertilisation, refers to the fertilisation of an egg cell from one individual with the male gamete of another.

Autogamy which is also known as self-fertilisation, occurs in such hermaphroditic organisms as plants and flatworms; therein, two gametes from one individual fuse.

==Other variants of bisexual reproduction==

Some relatively unusual forms of reproduction are:&lt;ref name=Stenberg2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000351731 |pmid=23796636 |title=Meiosis and Its Deviations in Polyploid Animals |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=140 |issue=2–4 |pages=185 |year=2013 |last1=Stenberg |first1=P |last2=Saura |first2=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1738 |title=Simultaneous Mendelian and clonal genome transmission in a sexually reproducing, all-triploid vertebrate |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=279 |issue=1732 |pages=1293 |year=2011 |last1=Stock |first1=M |last2=Ustinova |first2=J |last3=Betto-Colliard |first3=C |last4=Schartl |first4=M |last5=Moritz |first5=C |last6=Perrin |first6=N |pmc=3282369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gynogenesis]]: A sperm stimulates the egg to develop without fertilisation or syngamy. The sperm may enter the egg.

[[Hybridogenesis]]: One genome is eliminated to produce haploid eggs.

[[Canina meiosis]]: (sometimes called "permanent odd polyploidy") one genome is transmitted in the Mendelian fashion, others are transmitted clonally.

==Benefits of cross-fertilisation==
{{main article|Allogamy|Heterosis}}
The major benefit of cross-fertilisation is generally thought to be the avoidance of [[inbreeding depression]]. [[Charles Darwin]], in his 1876 book ''[[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'' (pages 466-467) summed up his findings in the following way.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR (1876).  The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881-Worms-CrossandSelfFertilisation-F1249/1876-F1249.html see page 466-467&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from the union of two distinct individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have an immense advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigour and fertility over the self-fertilised offspring from one of the same parents. And this fact is amply sufficient to account for the development of the sexual elements, that is, for the genesis of the two sexes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, it is thought by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0340519 |pmid=16856849 |title=Why have sex? The population genetics of sex and recombination |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=519–22 |year=2006 |last1=Otto |first1=S.P |last2=Gerstein |first2=A.C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a long-term advantage of out-crossing in nature is increased genetic variability that promotes adaptation and/or avoidance of extinction (see [[Genetic variability]]).

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species.

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem.

The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing.

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'.

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

===Scholarly tradition===
====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-theistic worldviews===
====Secular humanists====
{{main|Secular humanism}}

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two.

I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

[[File:Fountain of Eternal Life crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Fountain of Eternal Life]]'' in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."&lt;ref name="GVCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=Greater Cleveland Veteran's Memorial, Inc. |date=2003 |author=Marshall Fredericks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms}}

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [[PLoS Biology]] paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/08/01/54/PDF/stewart_Plos.pdf|title= Aging and Death in an Organism That Reproduces by Morphologically Symmetric Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524855.800-bacteria-death-reduces-human-hopes-of-immortality.html |title=Bacteria Death Reduces Human Hopes of Immortality |date=February 5, 2005 |website=New Scientist magazine, issue 2485, page 19 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', a jellyfish (phylum [[Cnidaria]], class [[Hydrozoa]], order [[Anthoathecata]]), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a [[polyp]] using the cell conversion process of [[transdifferentiation]].&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2006|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121052612/http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2015-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an [[indefinite lifespan]].&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath" /&gt; Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to "all over the world".&lt;ref name="Telegraph-immortal-jellyfish"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/4357829/Immortal-jellyfish-swarming-across-the-world.html |title={{-'}}Immortal' jellyfish swarming across the world |date=January 30, 2009 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate= 2009-06-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090130-immortal-jellyfish-swarm.html|title="Immortal" Jellyfish Swarm World's Oceans|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Bristlecone pine]]s'' are speculated to be potentially immortal;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} the oldest known living specimen is over 5,000 years old.

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999.

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957.

* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging.

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
{{Main|Digital immortality}}

==Religious views==
{{Main|Afterlife|Soul}}
As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle.

[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">'''Information-theoretic death''' is the scrambling of information within a [[brain]] to such an extent that recovery of the original person becomes theoretically impossible.

Information-theoretic death is an attempt to define death in a way that is permanent and independent of any future medical advances, no matter how distant or improbable that may be.

Because detailed reading or restoration of information-storing brain structures is well beyond current technology, it is generally not of practical importance in "mainstream medicine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are |author=[[Sebastian Seung]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year = 2012| pages = 271| isbn=9780547678597| url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXwEuoYl3wQC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;q=%22information-theoretic%20death%22| quote=Merkle's definition of death is of more philosophical than practical importance. To apply it, we need to know exactly how memories, personality, and other aspects of personal identity are stored in the brain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is of great importance in [[cryonics]], where consideration of future technology is important.

[[Ralph Merkle]] defined information-theoretic death as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merkle R, |title=The technical feasibility of cryonics |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=39 | issue=1 |pages=6–16 |date=September 1992 | pmid=1435395 | doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-W |url=http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A person is dead according to the [[information theory|information theoretic]] criterion if their [[memory|memories]], [[personality]], hopes, dreams, etc. have been destroyed in the information theoretic sense. If the structures in the brain that [[memory encoding|encode memory]] and personality have been so disrupted that it is no longer possible in principle to recover them, then the person is dead.

'''Joann Aalfs''' (born March 29, 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aalfs|first1=Joann W|title=United States Public Records, 1970–2009|url=https://familysearch.org|publisher=FamilySearch|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Americans|American]] [[women's rights]] and [[LGBT rights]] activist.

==Early work==

Joann Aalfs was born in 1923 in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. She graduated from [[Bennington College]] in 1945, before studying at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York City. There, she served alongside her then husband in various [[Presbyterian]] ministries, in areas such as [[Salem (town), New York|Salem, New York]] and [[Kasur]], [[Pakistan]] in 1951–1952. Aalfs began, in 1963, organizing political rallies and social events with women in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. At a local [[YWCA]] they founded the Women's Awareness Group, alongside a newsletter called ''Rough Draft,'' which told the stories of the women within the organization. She would proceed to work with the [[New Bedford Women's Center]] in 1972, Women and Violence from 1976 to 1977, and the [[Southeastern Massachusetts University]] Women's Center from 1972 to 1978.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara J. Love|title=Feminists who changed America, 1963–1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 January 2012|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03189-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Aalfs left her [[spousal abuse|abusive]] marriage and sought shelter at the Battered Women's Shelter in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. She has four children, including activist [[Janet Aalfs]].&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt;

==Today==

By 2004, Aalfs had [[come out of the closet]] as a [[lesbian]] and had begun organising to help other lesbians in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] and [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Her personal [[archives]] are in the collection of the [[Sophia Smith Collection]] at [[Smith College]].&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithCollege"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=Lesbians and Bisexual Women | work=Collections by subject | publisher=[[Smith College]] | url=http://www.smith.edu/library/libs/ssc/subjlesbians.html | accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kherubim''' or Kherans are an [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Wildstorm Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24114-wildstorm-vets-reunite-for-oral-history.html |title=WILDSTORM Vets Reunite For Oral History |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]]'' #1 (August 1992).

==Biology==
Kherubim are various groups/races of people from the planet Khera. Kherubim resemble humans in appearance but are physically far stronger and more durable and extremely long-lived, nearly [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] was harmed by armor-piercing machine gun bullets; however, after they are surgically removed, she makes a full and rapid recovery. Kherans (including Titanthropes) can interbreed with humans, bearing fertile offspring.

An evolutionary drawback to their near-immortality is that nearly all Kheran females are [[infertile]]; only very rarely will a Kheran produce offspring. This is a natural check against overpopulation. Only one in 10,000 Kheran females is capable of giving birth, and only then at her very first mating. Of those, only one in approximately 10,000 will become pregnant, and only 1 in 1000 of those babies will be born alive; the rest are stillborn. The saving grace of the species is that this infertility does not seem to apply when the Kheran is mating with another species, as Earth has various Kheran/human hybrids.

More powerful Kherans are known as Lords and may possess telekinetic and energy manipulation abilities. [[Mister Majestic]], [[Lord Emp]] and [[Spartan (comics)|Yohn Khol]] are Kherubim Lords.
 
Shapers are a [[subspecies]] of Kherans. They are [[shapeshifters]] who are able to manipulate the molecular structure of their bodies, transforming part or all of their bodies into a substance with [[metal]]lic properties, which they can manipulate and reshape at will. The Wildcat [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]] is a Shaper.

Though genetically a different species, the Titanthropes (or simply Titans) have been part of Kherubim society for so long that they are also often called Kherubim. However, they are considered and treated as second-class citizens of Khera by the Kherubim. They are large, purple-skinned humanoids who are able to increase or decrease their mass. Males have large yellow horns growing from their backs. A Titan's intelligence is inversely proportional to their current size. The Wildcat [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] is a Titanthrope.

==History==
Thousands of years ago, the Kherubim destroyed their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans would slowly become more or less accepted within the Kherubim society but remained [[second-class citizen]]s.

Millennia ago, the Kherans came into contact with the [[Daemonite]]s and a war erupted between both species. This war would last several centuries. A small group of Kherans and Daemonites crashlanded on Earth and inspired humanity with tales of gods, angels, demons, and monsters. Their conflict would continue until the end of the 20th century, while in space the Kherans would go on to defeat the Daemonites. Kherans imposed heavy [[indemnity|indemnities]] on the Daemonites and their society went bankrupt trying to pay them off. Khera allowed Daemonites to migrate to the more prosperous planet, but forced these Daemonites refugees to live in [[ghetto]]s.

When a small group of Kheran and half-Kheran heroes from Earth known as the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] arrived on Khera, they were welcomed as heroes, but quickly learned that Kheran society had changed over the years. Disgusted with the autocratic nature of Kheran society, they left the planet and returned to Earth.

Later, the Kherubim lord [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] found hidden Kheran devices, known as Planet Shaper Engines, beneath the surface of the Earth. This caused the realization that humanity and Kherans were closely related and that similar species had been seeded throughout the universe, creating both the Daemonites and Kherans in addition to humans.

The Shaper Guild from Khera arrived on Earth and announced that factions within Kherubim society had decided on using Planet Shaper Engines to transform the Earth into another Khera, causing a civil war.

==Culture==
Kherans are a warrior race with a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and [[honor]].

Due to their low fertility, every Kheran man and woman coming of age has to mate with an appointed partner. If the woman gives birth, she must become a priestess. If not, she may go on to live her life as she wishes. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] has managed to avoid becoming a priestess, despite giving birth, because her mother told others that the baby had died, allowing Zannah to become a warrior. Her mother then passed Zannah's baby, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]], off as Zealot's sister. As a mother of two children, Zannah's mother, Harmony, has become a living legend. No Kheran can remember the last time a Kheran woman gave birth to more than one child in her life. Zannah became the founder of the [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] Sisterhood.

Older and more powerful Kherans are named Lords. It remains unclear what makes a Kheran a Lord, but a Lord is capable of undergoing the ritual of Ascension when he is ready. The Ascension ritual is an important part of the Kheran culture, where a Lord asks a partner or good friend to destroy his body so that his spirit can be free. A Lord usually has so much energy stored in his body that this process tends to consume both Kherans.

The Coda worship a goddess, Hecate, but little is known about this religion. Other Kherans apparently do not worship any gods but believe in individual enlightenment through Ascension.

Though originally seen as noble and protective of other species, the Kherans were later shown to be quite [[speciesism|speciesist]], looking down upon other species while perceiving themselves as tolerant and benevolent.

==Politics==
The Kherans have a political system where various parties vie for power. The various factions include:
*The Pantheon, the party of the Lords. They are currently in power and stand for stability and economic progress.
*The Coda, a sisterhood of warriors. They want war and combat to prove their worth.
*The Shapers Guild represents all Shapers within Kheran society. They follow the orders from the Pantheon but have their own secret agenda. They claim to shape the destiny of Khera and are aware of its true origin.
*The Titantropes, while individually repressed by the Kherubim, hold great power as a faction. While being only a small political faction, it is in fact their vote that either keeps the Pantheon in power or puts the Coda in power.
* The Brotherhood of the Sword: a male version of the Coda, its members are created through [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. They devote their whole life to the mastery of bladed weapons and suppressing their own emotions. Some Bladesmen sacrifice themselves to become Scimitars, using stolen DNA from the Shapers Guild to become living war machines. The Brotherhood on Earth betrayed Khera and allied themselves with the Daemonites.
* The Adrastea: a race of Kherubim empaths, originally bred to be slaves, but they soon became the largest [[organized crime|crime syndicate]] in Kheran society.

==Technology==
While preferring bladed weapons in combat, Kherans are technologically advanced. They own spaceships capable of interstellar flights. They are capable of inscribing knowledge in the form of organic molecules, which when injected into the bloodstream, downloads that knowledge straight into the brain. They are capable of manipulating the laws of chance, simply for the purpose of entertainment as their 'Coincidental Mansion' shows. Armies of very advanced [[Android (robot)|androids]] known as the [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan Guards]] serve as soldiers. Spartan Guards have shown high intelligence and superhuman physical capabilities. Kherubim Planet Shapers can [[Terraforming|terraform]] worlds and alter living DNA and can remain functional for billions of years.

==Notable Kherans==
*[[Mister Majestic|Lord Majestros]], the greatest living hero for all Kherubim.
*[[Lord Emp]], ascended from the physical plane. Former member of the Pantheon.
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]], former member of the Coda.
*[[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]
*[[Spartan (comics)|Lord Yohn Kohl]], the template for the android Spartan.
*Lord S'lyton, father of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Marc Slayton]]
*Ferrian, member of [[Wildcore]].
*Charis, also known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]. An Adrastea with empathic abilities, trained by the Coda.

'''''Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future''''' is a "[[future history]]" science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author [[Olaf Stapledon]]. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/last-and-first-man-of-vision/161949.article|title=Last and first man of vision|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=23 January 1995|access-date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eighteen distinct human [[species]], of which our own is the first. The book employs a [[List of narrative techniques|narrative conceit]] that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a [[List of modern channelled texts|channelled text]] from the last human species.

Stapledon's conception of history is based on the [[Hegelian Dialectic]], following a repetitive cycle with many varied [[civilisations]] rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but it is also one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of [[genetic engineering]], and is an early example of the fictional [[Group mind (science fiction)|supermind]]; a consciousness composed of many [[telepathy|telepathically]]-linked individuals.

In 1932, Stapledon followed ''Last and First Men'' with the far less acclaimed ''[[Last Men in London]]''. Another Stapledon novel, ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), could also be considered a sequel to ''Last and First Men'' (mentioning briefly man's evolution on Neptune), but is even more ambitious in scope, being a history of the entire universe.

It is the 11th title in the [[SF Masterworks]] series.

== Human species ==
* '''First Men'''. (Chapters 1–6) Our own species: rivalries of nation-states in Europe, the rivalry of America and China, the First [[World State]], its destruction as a result of using up all natural resources, followed by the [[Patagonia]]n Civilization 100,000 years hence, with the cult of [[Youth]], and its destruction after the sabotage of a mine which leads to a colossal subterranean atomic explosion and the ensuing intercontinental [[nuclear holocaust]], rendering most of the Earth's surface uninhabitable for millions of years save for the poles and the northern coast of [[Siberia]]. The only survivors are thirty-five humans stationed at the [[North Pole]], who eventually split up into two separate species, the Second Men and some sub-humans.
* '''Second Men'''. (Chapters 7– 9) "Their heads, indeed, were large even for their bodies, and their necks massive. Their hands were huge, but finely moulded...their legs were stouter...their feet had lost their separate toes...blonde [[hirsute]] appearance...Their eyes were large, and often [[jade]] [[Shades of green#Jade|green]], their features firm as carved [[granite]], yet mobile and [[wikt:lucent|lucent]]. ...not till they were fifty did they reach maturity. At about 190 their powers began to fail..." Unlike our species, [[egotism]] is virtually unknown to them. At the acme of their highly advanced civilization, just as they are about to create a superior human species by genetic engineering, a protracted war with the Martians finally ends with the Martians extinct and the Second Men gone into eclipse.
*'''Third Men'''. (Chapter 10) "Scarcely more than half the stature of their predecessors, these beings were proportionally slight and lithe. Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of red-gold hairs... golden eyes... faces were compact as a cat's muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and in races. ... But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of living steel." Deeply interested in music and in the [[genetic engineering|design of living organisms]].
*'''Fourth Men'''. (Chapter 11) Giant brains, built by the Third Men. For a long time they help govern their creators, but eventually come into conflict. After reducing the Third Men to the status of lab animals, they eventually reach the limits of their scientific abilities and discover that emotions and body are also necessary for complete understanding of the cosmos.
*'''Fifth Men'''. (Chapters 11–12) An artificial human species designed by the brains. "On the average they were more than twice as tall as the First Men, and much taller than the Second Men... the delicate sixth finger had been induced to divide its tip into two [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputian fingers]] and a corresponding thumb. The contours of the limbs were sharply visible, for the body bore no hair, save for a close, thick [[wikt:skullcap|skull-cap]] which, in the original stock, was of ruddy brown. The well-marked eyebrows, when drawn down, shaded the sensitive eyes from the sun." After clashing with and finally eliminating the Fourth Men, they develop a technology greater than Earth had ever known before. When Earth ceases to be habitable, they [[Terraforming|terraform]] [[Venus]], committing [[genocide]] on its marine native race which tries to resist them – but do not cope well after the move.
*'''Sixth Men'''. (Chapter 13) "Sadly reduced in stature and in brain, these abject beings... gained a precarious livelihood by grubbing roots upon the forest-clad islands, trapping the innumerable birds, and catching fish... Not infrequently they devoured, or were devoured by, their [[Pinniped|seal]]-like relatives." After tectonic changes provide them with a promising land mass, they fluctuate like the First Men and repeat all their mistakes.
*'''Seventh Men'''. Flying humans, "scarcely heavier than the largest of terrestrial flying birds", are created by the Sixth Men. After 100 million years, a flightless pedestrian subspecies appears which re-develops technology.
*'''Eighth Men'''. "These long-headed and substantial folk were designed to be strictly pedestrian, physically and mentally." When Venus becomes uninhabitable, about to be destroyed along with the entire inner solar system, they design the Ninth Men, who will live on [[Neptune]].
*'''Ninth Men'''. (Chapter 14) "Inevitably it was a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] type, limited in size by the necessity of resisting an excessive [[gravitation]]... too delicately organized to withstand the ferocity of natural forces on Neptune... civilization crumbled into savagery." After the Ninth Men's civilization collapses, the Ninth Men themselves devolve into various animal species.
*'''Tenth to Thirteenth Men'''. (Chapter 14) "Nowhere did the typical human form survive." About three hundred million years after the colonization of Neptune, a rabbit-like species evolves into the Tenth Men. The Tenth Men are sentient but primitive. After a plague wipes out the Tenth Men, several other primitive human species rise and fall.
*'''Fourteenth to Seventeenth Men'''. The Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Men are essentially Neptunian versions of the First, Second and Fifth Men, respectively. The Fourteenth Men create great civilisations and destroy them, frustrated with their own imperfections. The Fifteenth improve upon that, creating a spirituality based on "a devotion to the fulfilment of human capacity". They eventually create the Sixteenth Men - the first Neptunian artificial species. Thus the cycle of rise and collapse of civilisations ends, and steady progress takes its place. The Sixteenth Men achieve the highest level of civilisation possible "to the individual human brain acting in physical isolation" and to avoid stagnation create the Seventeenth Men, with an ability for "mental fusion of many individuals" to succeed them; however, the Seventeenth Men are "flawed" in some unspecified way, unimagined by the 16th due to their lesser awareness, and last only a short period of time before being replaced by the Eighteenth Men.
*'''Eighteenth Men'''. (Chapters 15–16) The most advanced humans of all, essentially a perfected version of the 17th species. A race of philosophers and artists with a very liberal sexual morality. "Superficially we seem to be not one species but many." (One interesting aspect of the Eighteenth Men is that they have a number of different "sub-genders," variants on the basic male and female pattern, with distinctive temperaments. The Eighteenth Men's equivalent of the family unit includes one of each of these sub-genders and is the basis of their society. The units have the ability to act as a group mind, which eventually leads to the establishment of a single group mind uniting the entire species.). This species no longer died naturally, but only by accident, suicide or being killed. Despite their hyper-advanced civilisation, they practice ritual [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 15, subchapter 1: "[W]henever a human being has chosen to die, his body is ceremoniously eaten by his friends".&lt;/ref&gt; They are eventually extinguished on [[Neptune]] after a [[supernova]] infects the sun, causing it to grow so hot that it consumes the remains of the [[solar system]], faster than any means of escape they can devise. Unable to escape, this last species of man devises a virus to spread life to other worlds and cause the evolution of new sentient species throughout the galaxy.

===Sub-humans===
*'''Baboon-like Submen'''. (Chapter 7) "Bent so that as often as not they used their arms as aids to locomotion, flat-headed and curiously long-snouted, these creatures were by now more baboon-like than human".
*'''Seal-like Submen'''. (Chapter 13) "The whole body was moulded to stream-lines. The lung capacity was greatly developed. The spine had elongated, and increased in flexibility. The legs were shrunken, grown together, and flattened into a horizontal rudder. The arms also were diminutive and fin-like, though they still retained the manipulative forefinger and thumb. The head had shrunk into the body and looked forward in the direction of swimming. Strong carnivorous teeth, emphatic gregariousness, and a new, almost human, cunning in the chase, combined to make these seal-men lords of the ocean".
*'''Period of Eclipse'''. (Chapter 14) "Man's consciousness was narrowed and coarsened into brute-consciousness. By good luck the brute precariously survived." Nature succeeds in colonising Neptune where sentient life fails. Human-derived mammals of all shapes come to dominate Neptune's [[ecosystem]] before adapting well enough for the vestiges of opposable thumbs and intelligence to become assets again.

== Appearances in other media ==
Characters discuss the novel in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[Star-Begotten]]''.

The novel appears in the computer game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' as a reference when a corporation in the game allegedly tries to develop the Second Men in the series, but also in a much broader aspect as the game deals with [[genetic engineering]], the next phase of [[evolution]] and human augmentations. Also similar to the book are the options presented to the player as to where human kind will go next: a fall back into an almost savage state of humanity, a keeping of the status quo or an extreme progression with the danger of sacrificing basic rights.

Icelandic composer [[Jóhann Jóhannsson]] directed and scored a multimedia ''Last and First Men'', "combining a film narrated by actress [[Tilda Swinton]] and accompanying score played by the BBC Philharmonic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://confidentials.com/manchester/mif-2017-last-and-first-men-reviewed-manchester-international-festival |title=MIF 2017 - Last and First Men, Reviewed |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=7 July 2017 |website=Confidentials Manchester |publisher= |access-date=25 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on other writers ==
[[Brian Aldiss]], in his preface to the 1962 edition, acknowledges the deep impression on him—and considerable influence on his own later writing–of Stapledon's book, which he encountered in 1943 while a British soldier fighting the Japanese in [[Burma]] – "An appropriately unusual period of life at which to encounter a vision so far outside ordinary experience".

Aldiss also mentions [[James Blish]] as another writer deeply influenced by Stapledon.

[[C. S. Lewis]] in his own preface to ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', notes: "I believe that one of the central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations I had with a scientific colleague, some time before I met a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow".

The reference to "objecting to Stapledon's philosophy" was no accident. In particular, the Christian Lewis objected to Stapledon's idea, as expressed in the present book, that mankind could escape from an outworn planet and establish itself on another one; this Lewis regarded as no less than a [[Satan]]ic idea – especially, but not only, because it involved [[genocide]] of the original inhabitants of the target planet. [[Professor Weston]], the chief villain of Lewis' [[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]], is an outspoken proponent of this idea, and in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' Lewis opposes to it the depiction of the virtuous and stoic [[Martians]]/Malacandrians who choose to die with their dying planet, even though they possessed the technology to cross space and colonise Earth.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] has said of Stapledon's 1930 book ''Last and First Men'' that "No other book had a greater influence on my life&amp;nbsp;... [It] and its successor ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career".&lt;ref name="testermanscifi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |title=Arthur C. Clarke Quotes |accessdate=8 February 2007 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123183810/http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |archivedate=23 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. P. Lovecraft]] held the book in very high regard (though he did not say whether it influenced any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to [[Fritz Leiber]]&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Fritz Leiber on 18 November 1936. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's ''Last and First Men'' ... Probably you ''have'' read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Fritz Leiber on 19 December 1936. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of ''Last and First Men''—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that [[Forrest J Ackerman|Master Ackerman]] would denominate "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Arthur Widner on 20 February 1937. Published in ''Selected Letters V'' edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; he said "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of [[H. G. Wells]]'s [[H. G. Wells bibliography|novels]], [[S. Fowler Wright]]'s ''[[The World Below]]'', &amp; that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, ''Last &amp; First Men''."

[[John Maynard Smith]] has said "A man called Olaf Stapledon was a marvellous predictor who wrote science fiction books that I read when I was 16 and that completely blew my mind; and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] put his finger on quite a number of bright thoughts. He and I have something in common: we both took out of the public library the same science fiction book when we were boys of about 15 or 16, which was Stapledon's ''Last and First Men''. We took it out of the same country library in [[Porlock]] in Somerset. Whoever put that book on the shelves had a lot to answer for!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Hart Davis]] (2004) ''talking science'' Wiley {{ISBN|0-470-09302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Patrick Moore]] has said "The science fiction novel ''Last and First Men'' by Olaf Stapledon is immensely thought-provoking and I've read it time and time again."&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4122975.ece |title=Best science books |accessdate=6 September 2009 |format= |work= The Times | location=London | date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''last universal common ancestor''' ('''LUCA'''), also called the '''last universal ancestor''' ('''LUA'''),  '''cenancestor''', or (incorrectly&lt;ref group=R&gt;There is a common misconception that definitions of LUCA and progenote are the same; however, progenote is defined as an organism “still in the process of evolving the relationship between genotype and phenotype”, and it is only hypothesed that LUCA is a progenote.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gogarten|first1=Johann Peter|last2=Deamer|first2=David|title=Is LUCA a thermophilic progenote?|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=1|date=25 November 2016|page=16229|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;) '''progenote''', is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now [[Life|living on Earth]] have a [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theobald DL |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–22 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20463738 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T}}&lt;/ref&gt; LUCA is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the [[first living organism on Earth]], but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. 

While there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by [[phylogenetic bracketing|comparing the genomes of its descendants]], all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 [[gene]]s inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many [[co-adapted]] features, including [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] mechanisms to convert information between [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725" /&gt; However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="GogartenDeamer2016" /&gt;

LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the [[Paleoarchean]] [[era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doolittle WF|date=February 2000|title=Uprooting the tree of life|journal=Scientific American|volume=282|issue=2|pages=90–95|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|pmid=10710791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Glansdorff N, Xu Y, Labedan B|year=2008|title=The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner|journal=Biology Direct|volume=3|issue=|page=29|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-29|pmc=2478661|pmid=18613974}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few hundred million years after the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence of life on Earth]], for which there are several candidates.

[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, saying, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=C. |year=1859 |title=[[The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]] |page=490 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have separated the problem of the [[origin of life]] from that of the LUCA.

==Features==
{{further information|Phylogenetic bracketing}}

By [[phylogenetic bracketing|analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups]], the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of [[DNA]] floating freely within the cell, like modern [[bacteria]]. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, [[Carl Woese]] ''et al.'', who first proposed the currently-used [[Three-domain system|three domain system]] based on an analysis of &lt;!--the 16S --&gt;[[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a "...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1990 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=2112744 |pages=4576–79 |volume=87 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 |first=C.

While the gross anatomy of LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.&lt;ref name=W1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wächtershäuser |first1=Günter |year=1998 |title=Towards a Reconstruction of Ancestral Genomes by Gene Cluster Alignment |journal=Systematic and Applied Microbiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=473–74, IN1, 475–77 |doi=10.1016/S0723-2020(98)80058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |title=What is Life? |first=Michael |last=Gregory |publisher=Clinton College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20071213110350/http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=The universal nature of biochemistry |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=805–08 |date=January 2001  |pmid=11158550 |pmc=33372 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wächtershäuser, G. |title=From pre-cells to Eukarya – a tale of two lipids |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=13–22 |date=January 2003  |pmid=12492850 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four [[nucleotide]]s: [[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]], and [[deoxyguanosine]]. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[enzyme]], [[DNA polymerase]]. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and  [[DNA repair|repair]] enzymes including [[DNA topoisomerase]] and [[DNA ligase]]. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as [[histone]]s. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide [[codons]] which redundantly coded for 20 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;
If the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide [[thymidine]] was replaced by [[uridine]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The genetic code was expressed into [[protein]]s. These were assembled from free [[amino acid]]s by [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of a [[messenger RNA]] via a mechanism of [[ribosome]]s, [[transfer RNA]]s, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big [[50S]] and a small [[30S]].  Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by [[ribosomal protein]]s. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 [[amino acids]] were used, only in [[Chirality (chemistry)|L-isomers]], to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein [[enzymes]] catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The cell contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. The cell tended to exclude [[sodium]] and concentrate [[potassium]] by means of specific [[ion transporter]]s (or ion pumps).

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, Albermarle Street. 1859. pp. 484, 490.&lt;/ref&gt; The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one..."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"/&gt;

When the LUCA was hypothesized, [[cladogram]]s based on [[genetic distance]] between living cells indicated that [[Archaea]] split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high [[salinity]], [[temperature]] or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the [[black smoker|deep ocean vents]], where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the [[Eukaryota]] than to the [[Bacteria]], although many details are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xie, Q. |author2=Wang, Y. |author3=Lin, J. |author4=Qin, Y. |author5=Wang, Y. |author6=Bu, W. |title=Potential key bases of ribosomal RNA to kingdom-specific spectra of antibiotic susceptibility and the possible archaeal origin of eukaryotes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29468 |year=2012 |pmid=22247777 |pmc=3256160 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029468|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729468X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yutin, N. |author2=Makarova K.S. |author3=Mekhedov S.L. |author4=Wolf, Y.I. |author5=Koonin, E.V. |title=The deep archaeal roots of eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1619–30 |date=August 2008  |pmid=18463089 |pmc=2464739 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, based on "the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life,"&lt;ref name="Steel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steel, M. |author2=Penny, D. |title=Origins of life: Common ancestry put to the test |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=168–69 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20463725 |doi=10.1038/465168a |bibcode=2010Natur.465..168S}}&lt;/ref&gt; a formal test of universal common ancestry was published.&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; The formal test favored the existence of a universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding segments]]. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the [[Paleoarchean|Paleoarchean Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egel|first1=Richard|title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life|journal=Life|date=March 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=170–212|doi=10.3390/life2010170|pmc=4187143|pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the [[Chargaff's rules|AT/GC]] rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.

In an earlier hypothesis, [[Carl Woese]] (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through [[horizontal gene transfer]] among an ancient community of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woese C |title=The universal ancestor |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6854–59 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9618502 |pmc=22660 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6854 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6854W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved.&lt;ref name="majortransinevolution"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Major Transitions in Evolution | last=Maynard Smith | first=John | authorlink=John Maynard Smith |first2=Eörs |last2=Szathmáry |author2link=Eörs Szathmáry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1995 | location=Oxford, England | isbn=0-19-850294-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.

Ground-breaking research by [[William F. Martin]] (2016) genetically analyzed 6.1 million protein-coding genes and 286,514 protein clusters from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, and identified 355 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA.  The results "depict LUCA as [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent with a [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway]] (the reductive [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl-coenzyme A]] pathway), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms." The [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] also reveal "dependence upon [[transition metal]]s, [[Flavin mononucleotide|ﬂavins]], [[S-adenosyl methionine]], [[coenzyme A]], [[ferredoxin]], [[molybdopterin]], [[corrin]]s and [[selenium]].

'''Megaspores''', also called '''macrospores''', are a type of [[spore]] that is present in [[heterosporous]] [[plant]]s. These plants have two spore types, megaspores and [[microspore]]s. Generally speaking, the megaspore, or large spore, germinates into a female [[gametophyte]], which produces [[egg cell]]s. These are fertilized by [[sperm]] produced by the male gametophyte developing from the microspore. Heterosporous plants include the following:

* seed plants ([[gymnosperm]]s and [[flowering plant]]s)
* water ferns ([[Salviniales]])
* spikemosses ([[Selaginellaceae]])

==Megasporogenesis==
In gymnosperms and flowering plants, the megaspore is produced inside the nucleus of the [[ovule]].  During megasporogenesis, a diploid precursor cell, the '''megasporocyte''' or megaspore mother cell, undergoes [[meiosis]] to produce initially four haploid cells ('''the megaspores''').&lt;ref name="Estrada-Lun"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Beyond Promiscuity: From Sexuality to Apomixis in Flowering Plants | journal = [[In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology – Plant]] | date = Mar–Apr 2002 | first = A.

The monosporic pattern occurs most frequently (&gt;70% of angiosperms) and is found in many economically and biologically important groups such as Brassicaceae (e.g., ''Arabidopsis'', ''Capsella'', ''Brassica''), Gramineae (e.g., maize, rice, wheat), Malvaceae (e.g., cotton), Leguminoseae (e.g., beans, soybean), and Solanaceae (e.g., pepper, tobacco, tomato, potato, petunia).&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Female Gametophyte Development | journal = The Plant Cell | date = 2004-04-09 | first = Ramin | last = Yadegaria |author2=Gary N. Drewsb | volume = 16 | issue = Suppl | pages = S133–S141, Supplement | url = http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/16/suppl_1/S133 | accessdate = 2010-11-28 | doi=10.1105/tpc.018192| pmc = 2643389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern is characterized by cell plate formation after [[meiosis]] 1 &amp; 2, which results in four one-nucleate megaspores, of which three degenerate.  The bisporic pattern is characterized by cell plate formation only after meiosis 1, and results in two two-nucleate megaspores, of which one degenerates. The tetrasporic pattern is characterized by cell plates failing to form after either meiosis 1 or 2, and results in one four-nucleate megaspore.  Therefore, each pattern gives rise to a single functional megaspore which contains one, two, or four meiotic nuclei, respectively.&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews" /&gt; The megaspore then undergoes megagametogenesis to give rise to the female [[gametophyte]].

==Megagametogenesis==
[[Image:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg|thumb|300px|Plant ovules with megasporocytes before meiosis: Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule (inside ovary) on right]]
After megasporogenesis, the megaspore develops into the female [[gametophyte]] (the embryo sac) in a process called megagametogenesis.  The process of megagametogenesis varies depending on which pattern of megasporogenesis occurred.  Some species, such as ''Tridax trilobata'', ''Ehretia laevis'', and ''Alectra thomsoni'', can undergo different patterns of megasporogenesis and therefore different patterns of megagametogenesis.    
If the monosporic pattern occurred, the single [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] undergoes [[mitosis]] three times, producing an eight-nucleate cell.  These eight nuclei are arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell; these become the polar nuclei.  Depending on the species, these nuclei fuse together before or upon fertilization of the central cell. The three nuclei at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus, with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. At the other end of the cell, a cell wall forms around the nuclei and forms the antipodals. Therefore, the resulting embryo sac is a seven-celled structure consisting of one central cell, one egg cell, two synergid cells, and three antipodal cells.&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray Franklin. | last3 = Eichhorn | first3 = Susan E. | title = Biology of Plants | year = 2005 | publisher = W.H.

The bisporic and tetrasporic patterns undergo varying processes and result in varying embryo sacs as well.  In ''Lilium'' which has a tetrasporic pattern, the central cell of the embryo sac is 4N.  Therefore, upon fertilization the endosperm will be 5N rather than the typical 3N.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent work on the results of fertilization in angiosperms | journal = Annals of Botany | year = 1900 | first = E. | last = Sargent | volume = 14 | pages = 689–712 | url = http://images.iasprr.org/lily/female.shtml | accessdate = 2010-11-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101210182228/http://images.iasprr.org/lily/female.shtml | archivedate = 2010-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], '''missional living''' is the adoption of the posture, thinking, behaviors, and practices of a [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] in order to engage others with the [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]] message. The missional church movement, a [[church renewal]] movement predicated on the necessity of missional living by Christians, gained popularity at the end of the twentieth century due to advocates like [[Timothy J. Keller|Tim Keller]] and others in the Gospel and Our Culture Network.  Advocates contrast missional living with the concept of a select group of "professional" missionaries, emphasizing that all Christians should be involved in the [[Great Commission]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Keller, "The Missional church by Tim Keller" http://download.redeemer.com/pdf/learn/resources/Missional_Church-Keller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Understanding ''Missional''==
The missional living concept is rooted in the ''[[Missio dei]]'' (Latin, "the sending of God"). In 1934, Karl Hartenstein, a German [[Missiology|missiologist]], coined the phrase in response to [[Karl Barth]] and his emphasis on ''actio Dei'' ("the action of God"). In their view, missional activities stemming from God.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, David J, Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1991), 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Triune God is the primary acting agent in the world and within the church.

According to Lesslie Newbigin and Jesus' statements in the Gospel according to John, every Christian has been sent by Jesus with the gospel together in community to those in the surrounding culture for the sake of the King and His kingdom: “The Church is sent into the world to continue that which he came to do, in the power of the same Spirit, reconciling people to God.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Lesslie Newbigin]], ''The Gospel in a Pluralist Society'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1989, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, “As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you” (John 20:21).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No one can say: ‘Since I’m not called to be a missionary, I do not have to evangelize my friends and neighbors.’ There is no difference, in spiritual terms, between a missionary witnessing in his home town and a missionary witnessing in Katmandu, Nepal. We are all called to go—even if it is only to the next room, or the next block.”"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hale, ''On Being a Missionary'', p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==A missional (missionary) perspective==
''Missional living'' is the embodiment of the mission of Jesus in the world by incarnating the gospel. "It is imperative that Christians be like Jesus, by living freely within the culture as missionaries who are as faithful to the Father and his gospel as Jesus was in his own time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]], ''The Radical Reformission'', Zondervan, 2004, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This embodiment of the gospel is often referred to as "contextualization" or "inculturation."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Both refer to more than a simple translation of the gospel into different languages and cultures in the way that one translates a history book or a science text. Rather, they point to the embodiment of the living Word in human culture and social settings in such a way that its divine nature and power are not lost. True contextualization is more than communication. It is God working in the hearts of people, making them new and forming them into a new community. It is his Word transforming their lives, their societies, their cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hiebert and Eliose Hiebert Meneses, ''Incarnational Ministry'', Baker Book House, 1995, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five biblical distinctives form the foundation of a missional perspective:&lt;ref&gt;Dave DeVries, ''Missional Transformation: Fueling Missionary Movements that Transform America'', Bakke Graduate University, 2007, 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Church is sent by Jesus Christ (John 17:18; 20:21, Luke 9:2; Matt 28: 19–20; Acts 1:8)
# The Church is sent with the Cross (1 Cor 1:18, Eph 2:16, Col 2:14, 1 Pet2:24, 2 Cor 5:17–24)
# The Church is sent in Community (Acts 2:42–47; 5:42; John 13:34–35; 1 John 3:16–17)
# The Church is sent to every Culture (John 1:14; Matt 20:28; Acts 17:22–34; Luke 5:29)
# The Church is sent for the King and His Kingdom (Matt 10:7; 25:34; Luke 4:43; Rev 11:15–17; Jer 10:7; John 18:36)

[[Image:A Missional Perspective.JPG]]

===Sent===
Jesus sent His disciples on a mission. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission—being sent ones who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific culture. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jesus was the first apostle. He was sent by his Father. He, in turn, sent the Twelve. They went to people who would then take the gospel to the rest of the world. Whoever received it would understand that they, too, had been sent. With the gospel being what it is, the church as bearer of the gospel is bound to be apostolic."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Petersen and Mike Shamy, ''The Insider'', NavPress, 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cross===
Jesus Christ said that He came to earth to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He accomplished salvation through the cross. By dying on the cross, He paid the penalty for sin and satisfied God’s wrath. According to Scripture, without the cross, there is no salvation, no forgiveness, and no hope; because of the cross, there is eternal life. The mission and message of Jesus surround the cross. “For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor 1:18).

===Community===
Jesus loves the Church and He gave His life to redeem the Church. Community exists for Mission! Christians are to bring the gospel ''together'' to the culture. "The church is called to ''do'' the work of Christ, to be the means of his ''action'' in and for the world....Mission, in its widest as well as its more focused senses, is what the church is there for. God intends to put the world to rights; he has dramatically launched this project through Jesus. Those who belong to Jesus are called, here and now, in the power of the Spirit, to be agents of that putting-to-rights purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2006, 201, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
George Peters notes, “If man is to be reached, he must be reached within his own culture.”&lt;ref&gt;George Peters, ''A Biblical Theology of Missions'', Moody Press, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  This principle is observed when God became a man in the form of Jesus to come to earth and incarnate the gospel. As missionaries sent by Jesus, every Christian must learn to exegete their surrounding culture, uncovering the language, values, and ideas of the culture. Using this information, they take steps to reach people with the gospel message in the context of the surrounding culture.

===King and Kingdom===
The kingdom was central to Jesus’ message and mission. The Book of Acts ends with Paul, under house arrest in Rome, “proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:31). Christians are sent to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom so that others may enter the kingdom.
George Hunsberger conveys the idea that the Church is pointing beyond itself to the kingdom of God. The Church is not an end in itself; God has a mission that goes beyond the Church which includes the kingdom. The kingdom and the Church must never be divorced, yet they also must never be equated. In a similar way, “the reign must never be separated from the One who reigns.”&lt;ref&gt;George R. Hunsberger, “Called and Sent to Represent the Reign of God,” in ''Missional Church'', ed. Darrel Guder, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The kingdom is always at the heart of the King.

==The missional church==
The missional church movement first arose during the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. The movement seeks to rethink and redefine the nature of the church and create a new paradigm in which churches are seen as missional in nature, instead of attractional in nature. Leaders in the movement argue that instead of churches attempting to attract people to churches through church programs, churches should instead take the gospel outside of the church and engage society with the gospel, often by being involved not only in missions and evangelism but also in social justice movements. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission — being ''sent ones'' who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific cultural context. &lt;blockquote&gt;The church exists, in other words, for what we sometimes call "mission": to announce to the world that Jesus is its Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wright (theologian)|N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', 2006, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mission is not just a program of the church. It defines the church as God’s sent people. Either we are defined by mission, or we reduce the scope of the gospel and the mandate of the church. Thus our challenge today is to move from church with mission to missional church."&lt;ref&gt;Guder, ed., ''Missional Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Christian church|Church]] has a mission because Jesus has a mission. There is one mission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic [[organizing principle]] is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people."
&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hirsch]], ''The Forgotten Ways'', Brazos, 2007, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Missional living is a term that is used in contrast with historical institutional churches. Church leaders as well as Christians in general have often regarded the Church as an institution to which outsiders must come in order to receive a certain product, namely, the gospel and all its associated benefits. Institutional churches are sometimes perceived to exist for the members and depend on pastors and staff to evangelize the lost. The "missional church", on the other hand, attempts to take Christ to "the lost" and its members are personally engaged in reaching their communities with the message of Jesus Christ.

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

A '''nanobe''' is a tiny filamental [[structure]] first found in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sediment]]s.  Some scientists [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] that nanobes are the smallest form of [[life]], 1/10 the size of the [[Mycoplasma|smallest known]] [[Bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Nanjundiah2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nanjundiah | first =  V. | year = 2000 | title = The smallest form of life yet? | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–10 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF02985175 | pmid = 10824192 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uwins, Philippa, J. R.|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanobes.pdf|title=Novel nano-organisms from Australian sandstones|work= [[American Mineralogist]]| volume=83|pages=1541–1550|year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa Uwins ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes: About Philippa Uwins and the Discovery Team]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]]. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of [[oil exploration]] wells off Australia's west coast. Depths of retrieval were between {{convert|3400|m|mi|1}} and {{convert|5100|m|mi|1}} below the sea bed. While Uwins ''et al.'' present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are [[crystal]] growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to [[DNA]] might indicate that they are living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html "Nanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to the structures found in [[ALH84001]], a [[Mars meteorite]] found in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. 
Nanobes are similar in size to [[nanobacteria]], which are also structures that have been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused. Nanobacteria are thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or [[protocell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Claims ==
{{unsourced section|date=July 2017}}

* It is a living organism (contains [[DNA]] or some analogue, and reproduces).
* Has a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] similar to [[Actinomycetes]] and [[fungi]].
* Nanobes are about 20 [[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter, which may be too small to contain the basic elements for an organism to exist (DNA, ribosomes, etc.), suggesting that if they grow and reproduce they would need to do so in an unconventional way.
* The [[Martian meteorite]] [[ALH84001]], discovered in 1984 in the [[Antarctic]], contained similar tubular structures which some [[astrobiology|astrobiologists]] suggested could be evidence of life at an earlier time on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McSween, H.

==Responses==

A review in ''Microbes and Environments''&lt;ref name=Velimirov2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velimirov, B. | year = 2001 | title = Nanobacteria, Ultramicrobacteria and Starvation Forms: A Search for the Smallest Metabolizing Bacterium | journal = Microbes and Environments | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–77 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-23 | doi = 10.1264/jsme2.2001.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the various ultra-small forms of proposed life states that the main criticism of nanobes is that they appear too small to contain the biochemical machinery needed to sustain life. The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper.&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998 /&gt; He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

In [[biology]], an '''organism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'') is any individual [[entity]] that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. It is a synonym for "[[Outline of life forms|life form]]".

Organisms are classified by [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] into specified groups such as the [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[fungi]]; or [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microorganism]]s such as a [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=RS.|title=A dictionary of biology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|page=461|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All types of organisms are capable of [[reproduction]], [[Developmental biology|growth and development]], [[homeostasis|maintenance]], and some degree of response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[Human]]s are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] during [[developmental biology|development]] into specialized [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

An organism may be either a [[prokaryote]] or a [[eukaryote]]. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate [[Three-domain system|domains]]—[[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound [[cell nucleus]] and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called [[organelle]]s (such as [[mitochondria]] in animals and plants and [[plastid]]s in plants and [[algae]], all generally considered to be derived from [[symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic]] bacteria).&lt;ref name=cavaliersmith1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cavalier-Smith T.| year = 1987| title = The origin of eukaryotic and archaebacterial cells| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 503| issue =| pages = 17–54| pmid = 3113314| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb40596.x| bibcode = 1987NYASA.503...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, animals and plants are examples of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of organisms within the eukaryotes.

==Etymology==
The term "organism" (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'', from ὄργανον, ''organon'', i.e. "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|o)/rganon|ὄργανον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=organism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=organism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings, going back at least to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I., [[Critique of Judgment]]: §64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
An organism may be defined as an assembly of [[molecule]]s functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |edition=online |date=1999 |title=organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many definitions exclude [[virus]]es and possible man-made [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic life]] forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|organism|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[superorganism]] is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or [[social unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-cellular life===
{{main|Non-cellular life}}
[[Virus]]es are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous [[reproduction]], growth or [[metabolism]]. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but are capable of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few [[enzyme]]s and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the [[cell (biology)|host cell]]. In this sense, they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not classified as organisms, they do have their own [[gene]]s, and they do [[evolution|evolve]] by mechanisms similar to the evolutionary mechanisms of organisms.

The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate.&lt;ref name="10reasons" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moreira | first1 = D. | last2 = López-García | first2 = P. N. | title = Ten reasons to exclude viruses from the tree of life | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2108 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | year = 2009 | pmid = 19270719| pmc = | volume=7 | issue = 4 | pages=306–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the [[tree of life]]. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through [[horizontal gene transfer]] from viral hosts.&lt;ref name="10reasons" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern [[Biochemistry|the chemical processes of life]]. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their [[DNA]]-based genes.

Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of [[chemical compound]]s that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.

Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. [[Autotroph]]s produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while [[heterotroph]]s take in organic compounds from the environment.

The primary [[chemical element]] in these compounds is [[carbon]]. The [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as [[carbon dioxide]]), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ([[nucleic acid]]s), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).

===Macromolecules===
Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into [[macromolecule]]s and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are [[nucleic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of [[nucleotide]]s. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]]) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into [[codon]]s, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular [[amino acid]]. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, [[protein folding|folds]] in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.

These protein functions have been recognized:
# [[Enzyme]]s, which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism
# Structural proteins, such as [[tubulin]], or [[collagen]]
# Regulatory proteins, such as [[transcription factor]]s or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle
# Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some [[hormone]]s and their receptors
# Defensive proteins, which can include everything from [[Antibody|antibodies]] of the [[immune system]], to toxins (e.g., [[dendrotoxin]]s of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like [[canavanine]]

A bilayer of [[phospholipid]]s makes up the [[phospholipid membrane|membrane]] of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.

==Structure==
All organisms consist of structural units called [[cell (biology)|cells]]; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely [[epithelium]], [[nervous tissue]], [[muscle tissue]], and [[connective tissue]]. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the [[heart]], or as a barrier to the environment as the [[skin]]). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an [[organ system]] such as the [[reproductive system]], and [[digestive system]]. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.

===Cell===
The [[cell theory]], first developed in 1839 by [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]], states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; and cells contain the [[genetics|hereditary information]] necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.

There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a [[nuclear membrane]] so [[DNA]] is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.

All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a [[cell membrane|membrane]], which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells.

All cells share several similar characteristics of:&lt;ref name="AlbertsCh1"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=%22all+cells%22+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372023%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.4#23 The Universal Features of Cells on Earth] in Chapter 1 of ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=cell+biology+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+373693%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4 Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use of enzymes and other proteins [[genetic code|coded]] by DNA genes and made via [[messenger RNA]] intermediates and [[ribosome]]s.
* Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, [[molecule]]s and releasing [[by-product]]s. The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from [[metabolic pathway]]s.

===Last universal common ancestor===
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|thumb|[[Precambrian]] [[stromatolite]]s in the Siyeh Formation, [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]. In 2002, a paper in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested that these 3.5 [[Billion years|Gya]] (billion years old) [[geological formation]]s contain fossilized [[cyanobacteria]] microbes.

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including [[geology]] and [[planetary science]]. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of [[time]].

All organisms are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.

There is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of [[nucleic acid]]s as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty [[amino acid]]s as the building blocks for [[protein]]s. All organisms use the same [[genetic code]] (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to [[translation (genetics)|translate]] nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

Research published in 2016, by [[William F. Martin]], by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results "depict LUCA as [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent with a [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway]] (the reductive [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl-coenzyme A]] pathway), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing and thermophilic.

The results depict [[methanogen]]ic [[clostridium|clostria]] as a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and suggest that the LUCA inhabited an anaerobic [[hydrothermal vent]] setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and iron.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;"[http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016116 The physiology and habitat of the last universal common ancestor]" by Madeline C.

In prokaryotes, [[Transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural bacterial transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of [[natural competence]] to perform this complex process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen I |author2=Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat.

===Horizontal gene transfer===
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}
The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sequence comparisons suggest recent [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] of many genes among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma State – [https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biologist Peter Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Gogarten |url=http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 |title=Horizontal Gene Transfer - A New Paradigm for Biology |publisher=esalenctr.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms)===
Modern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organism and species. [[Cloning]] is the process of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another, with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Cloning is the subject of [[ethics of cloning|much ethical debate]].

In 2008, the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] assembled a synthetic [[Bacterial genome size|bacterial genome]], ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. ''The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments.''&lt;ref name=Venter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibsona, Daniel G. |author2=Benders, Gwynedd A. |author3=Axelroda, Kevin C. |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=One-step assembly in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments to form a complete synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20404–20409 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20404.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811011106 |pmid=19073939 |pmc=2600582|bibcode=2008PNAS..10520404G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, such as [[Synthetic Genomics]], have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C. K.|date=August 2013|title=Antimüllerian hormone inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone-induced adenylyl cyclase activation, aromatase expression, and estradiol production in human granulosa-lutein cells|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=2|pages=585–592.e1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.04.019|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23663993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Liu|first2=Lian|last3=Adhikari|first3=Deepak|last4=Jagarlamudi|first4=Krishna|last5=Rajareddy|first5=Singareddy|last6=Shen|first6=Yan|last7=Du|first7=Chun|last8=Tang|first8=Wenli|last9=Hämäläinen|first9=Tuula|date=2008-02-01|title=Oocyte-specific deletion of Pten causes premature activation of the primordial follicle pool|journal=Science|volume=319|issue=5863|pages=611–613|doi=10.1126/science.1152257|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18239123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuang|first=Haibin|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Peng|first3=Jing|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=December 2009|title=Premature ovarian failure, menopause and ovarian cancer, three nodes on the same string: Pten and other potential genes on the go|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=73|issue=6|pages=961–962|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.023|issn=1532-2777|pmid=19733443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

[[FOXO3|Foxo3a]] - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Wendy J.|last2=Umbers|first2=Alexandra J.|last3=Woad|first3=Kathryn J.|last4=Harris|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Winship|first5=Ingrid M.|last6=Gersak|first6=Ksenija|last7=Shelling|first7=Andrew N.|date=November 2006|title=Mutational screening of FOXO3A and FOXO1A in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1518–1521|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.054|issn=1556-5653|pmid=16979636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Binbin|last2=Mu|first2=Yuan|last3=Ni|first3=Feng|last4=Zhou|first4=Sirui|last5=Wang|first5=Jing|last6=Cao|first6=Yunxia|last7=Ma|first7=Xu|date=April 2010|title=Analysis of FOXO3 mutation in 114 Chinese women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=20|issue=4|pages=499–503|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.01.008|issn=1472-6491|pmid=20219431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Paratomy''' is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in animals where the organism splits in a plane perpendicular to the [[antero-posteriorly|antero-posterior axis]] and the split is preceded by the "pregeneration" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion.The developing organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion.

[[Budding]] can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. ''[[Convolutriloba retrogemma]]'' an [[acoela|acoel]] flat worm).&lt;ref name=Akesson2001&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1046/j.1463-6395.2001.00084.x| issn = 1463-6395| volume = 82| issue = 3| pages = 231–239| last = Åkesson| first = Bertil|author2=Robert Gschwentner |author3=Jan Hendelberg |author4=Peter Ladurner |author5=Johann Müller |author6=Reinhard Rieger | title = Fission in ''Convolutriloba longifissura'': asexual reproduction in acoelous turbellarians revisited| journal = Acta Zoologica| accessdate = 2011-07-13| date = 2001-12-01| url = http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c719135/pdf/Akesson-Gschwentner-2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdrc.20135| issn = 1542-9768| volume = 84| issue = 4| pages = 257–264| last = Egger| first = Bernhard| title = Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky| journal = Birth Defects Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53895">'''Pessimism''' is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an [[optimism|optimist]] is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Bennett, Oliver. ''Cultural pessimism.'' Edinburgh university press.  2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical pessimism''' is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often [[existential nihilism|existential nihilists]] believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.

==Etymology==
The term pessimism derives from the Latin word ''pessimus'' meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by [[Jesuit]] critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel '[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of [[Leibniz]] who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the ''Revue de Trévoux'' accused him of ''pessimisme''.&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dienstag |first=Joshua Foa |title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=February 17, 2009 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical pessimism==&lt;!-- "Philosophical pessimism" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:DOI Rousseau.jpg|thumb|250px|Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' was an attack on the enlightenment idea of social progress which he saw as morally decadent.]]
Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a [[worldview]] or [[ethic]] that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the [[Idea of Progress]] and [[religious faith]]) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the [[Dialogue of Pessimism]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] (which maintains that everything is ''hevel'', literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean '[[senseless]]' and '[[absurdity|absurd]]'.)

In [[Western philosophy]], philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit'', Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as "that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense [[irony|ironic]]; that [[free will|freedom]] and [[happiness]] are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical pessimists see the [[self-consciousness]] of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this "terror" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can "progress" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, "our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense "absurd". [[Absurdism|Absurdity]] is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: "a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to [[Socrates]] and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Mainländer]], recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in [[Indian religions]] and [[Christian monasticism]]). Some followers tend to believe that "expecting the worst leads to the best." [[Rene Descartes]] even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to "negative" events were removed.  [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace [[nothingness]]. Others like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]] respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a "Dionysian pessimism", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: [[Suicide]], a [[leap of faith]] (as per [[Kierkegaard]]'s [[knight of faith]]), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers ([[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/|title= Wicks, Robert "Arthur Schopenhauer"|chapter= Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is [[aphorism|aphoristic writing]], and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Dino Buzzati]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], [[Thomas Ligotti]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]].

==Notable proponents==

===Ancient Greeks===
In ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]] (called "the Weeping Philosopher") and [[Parmenides]] represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the "enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heraclitus]] denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable "indefinite." And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: "I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before." ''The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.&lt;ref name="diogquote"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Hegesias}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: "for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference".&lt;ref name="diogquote"/&gt; According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called ''Death by Starvation'', which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BCE, [[Stoicism]] propounded as an exercise "the premeditation of evils"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Burkeman |title=The Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92fgjq7-qLwC |accessdate=2013-01-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921922671 |pages=32–33 |quote=[...] the Stoics propose a[n] elegant, sustainable and calming way to deal with the possibility of things going wrong: rather than struggling to avoid all thought of these worst-case scenarios, they counsel actively dwelling on them, staring them in the face. Which brings us to an important milestone on the negative path to happiness — a psychological tactic that William [B.] Irvine argues is 'the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' toolkit'. He calls it 'negative visualisation'. The Stoics themselves, rather more pungently, called it 'the premeditation of evils'. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltasar Gracián===
[[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel ''El Criticón'' was his favorite book{{citation needed|reason=This is a very definite claim|date=January 2015}}. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's ''The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence'' into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style ([[conceptismo]]) and often quoted him in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History dictionary of Schopenhauer's philosophy |last=Cartwright |first=David E. |publisher=Scarecrow press, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracian's novel ''El Criticón'' (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for [[happiness]] which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. ''The Critic'' paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His ''Pocket Oracle'' was a book of [[aphorisms]] on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence |last=Gracian |first=Balthasar |publisher=Penguin books |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltaire===
Voltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to his critique of [[Alexander Pope]]'s optimistic "An Essay on Man", and [[Leibniz]]' affirmation that "we live in the best of all possible worlds." Voltaire's novel [[Candide]] is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his [[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Poem on the Lisbon Disaster]] is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a [[Deist]], Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the [[problem of evil]].

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
The major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called "the patriarch of pessimism".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, humans in their "natural goodness" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the [[state of nature]] as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by ''amour propre'', a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives "always outside himself", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of "perfectibility" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus ''[[The Social Contract]]'' opens with the famous phrase "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are "greater slaves" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live "outside themselves".

===Giacomo Leopardi===
Though a lesser known figure outside Italy, [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that "Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that "it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing."

Leopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of [[Christopher Columbus]] who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogue between Columbus and Pedro Gutierrez (Operette morali) |last=Leopardi |first=Giacomo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: "He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die."

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer had an influence upon later thinkers and artists such as Freud and Wagner]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism comes from his elevating of [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] above [[reason]] as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] is the ultimate metaphysical animating [[noumenon]] and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one [[metaphor]], Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Pessimism |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60206-349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. 
He pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — ''The world as will and representation, pg 319'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging "like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', pg 312&lt;/ref&gt; This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (''nichtigkeit'') and to realize that "the purpose of our existence is not to be happy".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', vol II, pg 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt;

Schopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through "losing yourself" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of [[asceticism]] (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by "saintly persons") could free oneself from the Will altogether.

Schopenhauer never used the term ''pessimism'' to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common terms used to describe his thought were [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] and [[irrationalism]] which he also never used.

=== Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism&lt;!--'Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism' and 'Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, '''post-Schopenhauerian pessimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a rather popular "trend" in 19th century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Langer, ''Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as [[Hegelianism]], [[materialism]], [[Neo-Kantianism]] and the emerging [[positivism]]. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in [[science]], the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's [[transcendental idealism]] into what [[Frederick C. Beiser]] calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser]] reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: "Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of ''transcendental realism'', i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience." (Beiser, Frederick C., ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not [[things-in-themselves]]), the transcendental realist thesis is that "the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves."&lt;ref name=Beiser147&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the "Post-Schopenhauerian" thinkers inherited from the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt sage]]'s teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would "assuage" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing [[historicism]], as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor [[Julius Frauenstadt]] and with [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist).&lt;ref name=Beiser147/&gt; [[Julius Bahnsen]] would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Philipp Mainländer]] set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a "pessimism of the future", a "[[Dionysian]] pessimism."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'', book V&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek [[pre-socratic]]s and also saw it at the core of ancient [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as "morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and [[nihilism]]. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a "great liberation" through a "pessimism of strength" which "does not sit in judgement of this condition".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to "make oneself a new pair of wings", i.e. to [[Transvaluation of values|re-evaluate all values]] and create new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of [[amor fati]] and [[eternal recurrence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is "good for one's health" as a "remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Camus===
[[Image:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camus used the punishment of [[Sisyphus]] to represent the human condition.]]

In a 1945 article, [[Albert Camus]] wrote "the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea."&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=DV6H76TX&amp;tocp=13|title= Albert Camus, ''Pessimism and Courage''}}, ''Combat'', September 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Camus helped popularize the idea of "[[Absurdism|the absurd]]", a key term in his famous essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which "sets me in opposition to all creation".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Camus |title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-73373-7 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through "eluding" (''l'esquive''), a 'trickery' for "those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth" /&gt; He considered [[suicide]] and [[religion]] as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of [[Sisyphus]], who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

==Other forms==

=== Epistemological ===
There are several theories of [[epistemology]] which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to [[nihilism]], [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[relativism]].

[[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819), analyzed [[rationalism]], and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy in order to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} according to which all rationalism reduces to [[nihilism]], and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]].

[[Richard Rorty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|social relations of power]], or [[language-games]] that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of [[anti-foundationalism]], while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.

===Political and cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural pessimism}}
Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the [[optimism]] or even [[utopianism]] of [[Hegelian]] philosophies. [[Emil Cioran]] claimed "Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"&lt;ref name="Cioran"&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienstag|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of [[social progress]] can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, "every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 178&lt;/ref&gt; Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an "idolatry of tomorrow" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in [[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]].

There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of [[cultural criticism]] and [[social decline]] which is seen in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s '[[The Decline of the West]]'. Spengler promoted a [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]] similar to the theories of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Spengler believed modern [[western civilization]] was in the 'winter' age of decline (''untergang''). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in [[Weimar Germany]]. Similarly, traditionalist [[Julius Evola]] thought that the world was in the [[Kali Yuga]], a dark age of moral decline.

Intellectuals like [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] correlate economic progress with [[economic inequality]], the stimulation of artificial needs, and [[affluenza]]. [[Anti-consumerist]]s identify rising trends of [[conspicuous consumption]] and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like [[Jean Baudrillard]] have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt;

[[Conservative]] thinkers, especially [[social conservatives]], often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. [[William F. Buckley]] famously remarked that he was "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" and [[Whittaker Chambers]] was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to [[communism]], though he was himself violently [[anti-communist]]. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in [[Christianity]] and/or [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosophy]], leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. [[Robert Bork]]'s ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah'' and [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''The Closing of the American Mind'' are famous expressions of this point of view.

Many economic conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the [[welfare state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lowenthal |first=D |title=Orwell's Political Pessimism in '1984' |publisher=Polity |year=1969 |jstor=3234097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to [[emigrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brym |first=RJ |title=The emigration potential of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Russia: recent survey results |publisher=International Sociology |year=1992 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/soc101y/brym/is.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] in the United States, the [[neologism]] "[[pessimism porn]]" was coined to describe the alleged [[Eschatology|eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn?

===Technological and environmental===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|right|Luddites destroy machines (1812)]]
Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the [[industrial revolution]] with the [[Luddite]] movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The [[Romantic movement]] was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |title=Romanticism |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718052334/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social critics and environmentalists believe that [[globalization]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the economic practices of modern [[capitalist]] states over-stress the planet's [[Balance of nature|ecological equilibrium]]. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, [[climate change]] will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/apr/27/the-global-delusion/ The Global Delusion, John Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] believes that the [[ecology]] of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/a-great-jump-to-disaster/ A Great Jump to Disaster?, Tim Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]], [[anti-globalization]] activists, and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-luddites]] can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern "progress". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is [[anarcho-primitivism]] which faults the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote [[deindustrialization]], abandonment of modern technology and [[rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]].

An infamous anarcho-primitivist is [[Theodore Kaczynski]], also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'' he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern "industrial-technological system".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto begins thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the [[voluntary human extinction movement]] which argues for the extinction of the human race through [[antinatalism]].

[[Pope Francis]]' controversial [[Laudato si'|2015 encyclical on ecological issues]] is ripe with [[Laudato si'#Technology|pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world]].

====Entropy pessimism====
{{See also |Heat death of the universe |Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #The relevance of thermodynamics to economics |Ecological economics #Methodology}}
[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution.]]
'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principles]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#First law|first law of thermodynamics]], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] — also known as [[Entropy|the entropy law]] — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the [[heat death of the universe]], taken as a whole.

The term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field |progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts |paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|magnum opus on ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|545}}

Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369-371}} &lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253-256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168-171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150-153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106-109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546-549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142-145}}

Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [[ecological economics]] and in the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]].

===Legal===
Bibas writes that some [[criminal defense attorney]]s prefer to err on the side of pessimism: "Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bibas |first=Stephanos |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |publisher=Harvard Law Review |volume=117 |number=8 |date=Jun 2004 |pages=2463–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a psychological disposition==
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
In the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with [[Melancholia|melancholy]], and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. 
The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional [[suffering|pain]] or even biology. [[Aaron Beck]] argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world.  Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in [[Depressive realism]] or ([[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic realism]]).&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt; Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirszner |first=Laurie |date=January 2012 |title=Patterns for College Writing |location=United States |publisher=Bedford/St.Martins |page=477 |isbn=978-0-312-67684-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pessimism item on the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] has been judged useful in predicting suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=RA |last2=Steer |first3=M |last3=Kovacs |title=Hopelessness and eventual suicide: a 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=5 |pages=559–563 |year=1985 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/5/559|doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.559 |pmid=3985195 |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.6328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=A |last2=Weissman |first3=D |last3=Lester |first4=L |last4=Trexler |title=The measurement of pessimism: the hopelessness scale |publisher=Journal of Consulting and Clinical |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wender |first=PH |last2=Klein |first2=DF |title=Mind, Mood and Medicine |publisher=New American Library |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Pragmatic criticism===
Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael R. Michau. "Doing, Suffering, and Creating": William James and Depression.  http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mmichau/james-and-depression.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[William James]] rejected their pessimism after suffering [[psychological illness|psychological]], or even [[psychosomatic]] illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term "pessimism" is being abused. The link between pessimism and [[nihilism]] is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to [[optimism]], nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. ''[[Personality Plus]]'' opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. [[melancholy temperament|melancholy]] and [[phlegmatic temperament|phlegmatic]]) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. [[choleric temperament|choleric]] and [[sanguine temperament|sanguine]]) miss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5610">'''Preventable years of life lost (PrYLL)''' is an epidemiological measure. It is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if s/he had not died prematurely due to a preventable cause of death.

PrYLL is closely related to [[Years of potential life lost|potential years of life lost (PYLL)]] and like PYLL, it gives more weight than mortality rates to deaths that occur among younger people. Unlike PYLL, PrYLL excludes causes of death that aren’t deemed to be preventable.

Premature deaths are those that could be avoided through public health interventions such as getting people to take more exercise or stop smoking, or in tackling the wider social determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181103/Living_well_for_longer.pdf Living Well for Longer: A call to action to reduce avoidable premature mortality], Department of Health, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Causes of death can be classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm Introduction to ICD codes] The Centre for Communicable Diseases.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom’s [[Office of National Statistics|Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) has published lists of ICD codes that are deemed to be avoidable, amenable and preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations/archived-consultations/2011/definitions-of-avoidable-mortality/consultation-on-definitions-of-avoidable-mortality.pdf Definitions of Avoidable Mortality] Office for National Statistics. February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this publication, the ONS proposes the following definition for preventable causes of death: “A death is preventable if, in the light of current understanding of the determinants of health, all or most deaths from that cause (subject to age limits if appropriate) could be avoided by public health interventions in the broadest sense”.

==History==

PrYLL was developed in 2012 by Errol Taylor at [http://www.rospa.com/ The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents] (RoSPA) to highlight the burden to society of accidental injury.

PrYLL features prominently in RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/bigbook/index.html RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention] RoSPA. December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and RoSPA’s guidance for local government decision-makers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/about/currentcampaigns/publichealth/info/delivering-accident-prevention-context.pdf Delivering Accident Prevention at Local Level] RoSPA June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which was supported by Public Health England(PHE) and funded by the UK Department of Health.

==Calculation==

To calculate the preventable years of life lost, the analyst has to set an upper reference age. This is essentially arbitrary and can be set, for example, to 65 to capture the whole population up to retirement, or 75 which, in developed countries, corresponds roughly to the life expectancy of the population being studied.

The analyst must then select the ICD codes for causes of death that are deemed by the ONS to be preventable.  The calculation can then proceed in the same way as for [[years of potential life lost]] (PYLL).

==Significance==

In the developed world, mortality counts and rates tend to emphasise the most common causes of death in older people because the risk of death increases with age. Since PrYLL excludes causes that aren’t deemed to be preventable and it gives more weight to deaths among young individuals, it is a powerful metric for those who want to draw attention to the premature and preventable loss of human potential. Some might argue that causes of death with the highest PrYLL should attract the greatest share of research and funding for prevention campaigns.

==Comparison==

This table which contrasts the leading causes of death when measured first by PrYLL and then by the total number of deaths. The rankings are completely different, depending on which epidemiological measure is chosen. Accidental injuries rise from being the fifth cause of death in terms of mortality, to the leading cause in terms of PrYLL while cancers drop from being the leading cause of death to be being second when measured in terms of PrYLL.

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}
{{clear}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

===Traction===
Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

==In fiction and legend==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

The idea of '''self-replicating spacecraft''' has been applied – in theory – to several distinct "tasks". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of [[space exploration]] is known as a '''von Neumann [[Space probe|probe]]'''. Other variants include the [[#Berserkers|Berserker]] and an automated [[terraforming]] seeder ship.

== Theory ==
In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[gas giant]]s, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, "Lungfish" (see [[Self-replicating machines in fiction]]), [[David Brin]] touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a [[Darwinism|Darwinistic]] fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of "species" they might even form a type of [[ecology]], or – should they also have a form of [[artificial intelligence]] – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of "generations".

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm| bibcode=1980JBIS...33..251F}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting [[automatic factory|automated industrial complex]] to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm Comparison of Reproducing and Nonreproducing Starprobe Strategies for Galactic Exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic [[faster-than-light]] propulsion, and speeds limited to an "average cruising speed" of 0.1'''[[Speed of light|c]]'''.) could spread throughout a [[galaxy]] the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as half a million years.

==Implications for Fermi's paradox==
In 1981, [[Frank Tipler]]&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;"Extraterrestrial Beings Do Not Exist", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 21, number 267 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an argument that [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the [[Fermi paradox]] – that is, the question of why we have not ''already'' encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response&lt;ref name="Sagan and Newman"&gt;Sagan, Carl and Newman, William: "The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 24, number 113 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Carl Sagan]] and William Newman. Now known as ''Sagan's Response'', it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected.

Soc.| volume=36|date=November 1983| pages=496–500| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ResolvingFermi1983.htm| bibcode=1983JBIS...36..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[nuclear warfare]], [[grey goo|nanoterrorism]], [[resource depletion|resource exhaustion]], [[environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]], or [[pandemic]]s.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. [[Radio]] transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic [[parsec]]) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the [[Hayflick limit]] in cell reproduction.  One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation).  Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel.  The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate.  The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials.  Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is named after [[Hungarian American]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[John von Neumann]], who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called "Universal Assemblers" and which are often referred to as "[[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]]".  While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a [[Bracewell probe]]), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist [[Paul Davies]] of [[Arizona State University]] has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own [[Moon]], having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']].

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the "[[Astrochicken]]", proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]]. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its "home base", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own [[planetary system]], and not explore interstellar space.

Oxford-based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea that future powerful [[superintelligence]]s will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson Swarm]] around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox]. Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berserkers ===
{{noref|section|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- [[Berserker probe]] section-redirects here --&gt;

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the ''Berserker''. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing [[exoplanets]] whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' series of novels by [[Fred Saberhagen]] which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – ''do'' constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] civilization (see ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', by [[Greg Bear]], in the section [[#In fiction|In fiction]] below) or could theoretically "mutate" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for [[terraforming]] processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable [[exoplanet]], or even one that might be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from [[embryo space colonization|stored embryos]] or from stored information using [[molecular nanotechnology]] to build [[zygotes]] with varying genetic information from local raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist."  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 21 (1980): page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to [[Generation ship]]s as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
	 
* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': The [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]s in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[book]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", Clarke's original short story upon which 2001 was based, were not.  The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke's novel.
	 
* ''[[Cold as Ice (novel)|Cold As Ice]]'': In the novel by [[Charles Sheffield]], there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[helium-4]], and various metals from the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]].
	 
* ''[[Destiny's Road]]'': [[Larry Niven]] frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book ''Destiny's Road'', Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans' technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] which serves as the humans' primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.

* ''[[No Man's Sky]]'': In the video game ''No Man's Sky'' mysterious probes called Sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy, analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction. It is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxy.
	 
* ''[[The Devil's Blind Spot]]'': See also [[Alexander Kluge]], ''The Devil's Blind Spot'' (New Directions; 2004.)
	 
* ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]'': In the novel by [[Robert Charles Wilson]], Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth's and the aliens' probes.
	 
* ''[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]'': In the book by [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] (published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity's existence to whoever might encounter them.
	 
* ''[[Von Neumann's War]]'': In ''Von Neumann's War'' by [[John Ringo]] and [[Travis S. Taylor]] (published by [[Baen Books]] in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineers]] some of the probes.
	 
* ''[[Grey Goo (video game)|Grey Goo]]'': In the video game ''Grey Goo'', the "Goo" faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction's units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the [[Grey Goo]] doomsday scenario.

* ''We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'' by [[Dennis E. Taylor]]: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America's religious replacement, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.

=== Berserkers ===
	 
* In the science fiction short story collection ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]], a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same [[fictional universe]] are the origin of the term "Berserker probe".
	 
* In the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (and the subsequent [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 series]]) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
	 
* The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker's massive mechanical Spheres).
	 
* Science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] later borrowed this notion in his short story "[[Limits (novel)|A Teardrop Falls]]".
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Star Control II]]'', the [[Slylandro]] Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks [[starship]]s of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to "resource extraction" mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce "at a geometric rate", the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player's ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
	 
* In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Excession]]'', hegemonising swarms are described as a form of [[Outside Context Problem]]. An example of an "Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object" is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself.  After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the [[Zetetic Elench]] and become "Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects". Such swarms (referred to as "smatter") reappear in the later novels ''[[Surface Detail]]'' (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
	 
* The [[Inhibitors (Revelation Space)|Inhibitors]] from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures.  They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets.  They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to 'remember' the necessary counter-measures.
	 
* Also from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' books, the "Greenfly" terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
	 
* The [[Reapers (Mass Effect)|Reapers]] in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' that they assimilate any advanced species.
	 
* [[Mantrid]] Drones from the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Lexx]]'' were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Infection (Babylon 5)|Infection]]" showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a 'Pure Icaran' based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]" features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization's level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
	 
* [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' deals directly with the concept of "Berserker" von Neumann probes and their consequences.  The idea is further explored in the novel's sequel, ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
	 
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'' series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'', and then in an attack in ''[[Across the Sea of Suns]]''.  The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in ''Across the Sea of Suns''.  The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
	 
* On ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced "races" known. 
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
	 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including [[List of starships in Stargate#Destiny|Destiny]]) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don't bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
	 
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[List of Justice League episodes#ep10|Dark Heart]]", an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
	 
* In the ''[[Homeworld: Cataclysm]]'' video game, a bio-mechanical virus called ''Beast'' has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
	 
* In the SF [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[EVE Online]]'', experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player's ships accidentally created 'rogue drones' which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'', the player may randomly encounter "Von Neumann". A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player's ships.  The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material.  If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones.  If all the player's ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving.  The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points.  The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion ''A Murder of Crows'', Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
	 
* In the ''[[X (computer game series)|X Computer Game Series]]'', the [[X (game series)#Featured races|Xenon]] are a malevolent race of [[AI|artificially intelligent]] machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update.  They are continual antagonists in the [[X (computer game series)#The X Universe|X-Universe]].
	 
* In the comic ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' a character mentions "Von Neumann rectal infestations" which are apparently caused by "Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks".
	 
* In the anime ''[[Vandread]]'', harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
	 
* In ''[[Earth 2160]]'', the Morphidian Aliens rely on {{Not a typo|Mantain}} strain aliens for colonization. Most {{Not a typo|Mantain}}-derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one {{Not a typo|Mantain}} Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they "choose an evolutionary path" and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
	 
* In the European comic series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' No 20 &amp; 21 goes over this subject. A kind of bezerk von Neumann is set to collision course with the pandarve system.
	 
* In PC role-playing game ''[[Space Rangers (video game)|Space Rangers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Space Rangers 2: Dominators]]'', a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
	 
* In the ''[[Star Wolves]]'' video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
	 
* The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
	 
* The Tet in the 2013 film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet's water in order to extract hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]].
	 
* In ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'', an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
	 
* In ''[[Herr aller Dinge]]'' by [[Andreas Eschbach]], an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is purposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.
	 
=== Replicating Seeder Ships ===
	 
* ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn's moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
	 
* ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
	 
* In the ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy|Metroid Prime]]'' subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
	 
* In [[David Brin]]'s short story collection, ''[[The River of Time]]'' (1986), the short story "Lungfish" prominently features von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;The complete text of the story has been placed on the author's website at [http://www.davidbrin.com/lungfish1.html davidbrin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
	 
* In ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as [[fire and forget]] lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their "children".
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep95|Remnants]]", the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)#ep75|Scorched Earth]]", a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the human adventurers live on a ship called ''Destiny''. Its mission was to connect a network of [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]], placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
	 
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' by [[Don Lawrence]] (starting with ''Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine'') is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">The '''Sisterhood Method''' is a household survey to estimate [[maternal death]]s recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]. Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, high quality data are rare. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce the problem of maternal death. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths.

Worldwide, maternal deaths decreased from approx 500,000 in 1980 to approx 350,000 in 2008. This decline in maternal deaths was associated mainly with better maternal education, maternal income, increased availability of trained birth attendants, and decreased pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: A systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5.

==Estimating maternal deaths==
Although maternal deaths are a major problem in developing countries, seen globally, the numbers are not very large, and there is an absence of high quality data. Yet, numbers are needed for planning in order to reduce maternal deaths. Several methods have been used to estimate maternal deaths. They include analysing census records and medical/death certificates,&lt;ref&gt;Underreporting of maternal deaths on death certificates and the magnitude of the problem of maternal mortality. Horon IL. Am J Public Health. 2005;95(3):478-82.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reproductive Age Mortality Studies'' (RAMOS).&lt;ref&gt;National maternal mortality study, 2005. Carried out by: Haceteppe University Medical School, Institute of Population Studies. For the Turkish Ministry of Health, the General Directorate of Mother and Child Health and Family Planning, and the Delegation of European Commission to Turkey. Ankara, Turkey. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, household surveys are used. All of these methods are not totally precise, but they can provide some useful information to decrease maternal mortality.

In contrast, full surveillance programmes would be too costly and too unrealistic for many developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Measuring maternal mortality: An overview of opportunities and options for developing countries. Graham WJ, Ahmed S, Stanton C, Abou-Zahr C, Campbell OM. BMC Med. 2008;6:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sisterhood Method==
The Sisterhood Method is the most common household survey for estimating maternal deaths. It is time- and cost-effective, and reduces sample size requirements; in countries or areas with high levels of maternal deaths, i.e. over 500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, a sample size of 4000 households or less is acceptable for this method.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.org/reproductive-health/publications/rht_97_28/RHT_97_28_chapter2.en.html&lt;/ref&gt; But the method still provides a useful means of assessing maternal mortality.

This method includes four questions about the sisters of the woman in question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sisterhood Method for Estimating Maternal Mortality: Guidance notes for potential users|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_RHT_97.28.pdf?ua=1|website=www.who.org|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How many sisters have you ever had, born to the same mother, who ever reached the age 15 (or who were ever married), including those who are now dead?
* How many of your sisters who reached the age of 15 are alive now?
* How many of these sisters are dead?
* How many of your sisters who are dead died during a pregnancy or during childbirth, or during the six weeks after the end of a pregnancy?

==Application==
Deaths occurring over a large interval of time are documented. The overall estimate of maternal mortality is determined for 10–12 years before the survey. The Sisterhood Method is useful because usually maternal mortality changes slowly. It provides some meaningful data in countries or areas where there are no alternative means of generating estimates.

==When should the Sisterhood Method not be used==
The Sisterhood Method is not appropriate in countries or areas where the total fertility rate is less than 4 children per family, in areas of significant migration, as well as during civil war, civil unrest or other significant social disruption.

==Variant ==
The original Sisterhood Method is an indirect method. The newer Direct Sisterhood Method targets a more limited reference period for sister deaths and uses more in depth questions (e.g., deaths among all siblings, all deaths that are pregnancy related, and when these deaths occurred). This variant relies on fewer assumptions than the original Sisterhood Method. However, it requires a larger sample size, data gathering and analysis are more complex, and has large confidence intervals. Despite these limitations, the Direct Sisterhood Method can result in greater specificity of information. A retrospective maternal mortality ratio (MMR) can be calculated. This variant is used by [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS).&lt;ref&gt;Direct and indirect estimates of maternal mortality from the Sisterhood Method. Rutenberg N, Sullivan JM (Eds). Washington DC, USA. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An assessment of DHS maternal mortality indicators. Stud Fam Planning. 2000:31(2):111-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fear of being buried alive''' is the [[fear]] of being [[premature burial|placed in a grave while still alive]] as a result of being incorrectly pronounced [[Death|dead]]. The abnormal, [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] version of this fear is referred to as '''taphophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τάφος - ''taphos'', "grave, tomb"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dta%2Ffos1 τάφος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;), which is translated as "fear of graves".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich H. "Taphophobia and resurrection mania", ''Schweizer Arkiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie''. 1977;120(2):195–203 {{PMID|905788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of modern medicine, the fear was not entirely irrational. Throughout history, there have been numerous cases of people being buried alive by accident. In 1905, the English reformer [[William Tebb]] collected accounts of premature burial. He found 219 cases of near live burial, 149 actual live burials, 10 cases of live dissection and 2 cases of awakening while being embalmed.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Christine. ''The Corpse: A History''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century had seen the development of [[Artificial respiration|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] and crude [[defibrillation]] techniques to revive persons considered dead, and the [[Royal Humane Society]] had been formed as the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, an American funeral director, T. M. Montgomery, reported that "nearly 2% of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/buried.asp "Just Dying to Get Out"], from [[Snopes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; although folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated, and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Paul. ''Vampires, Burial and Death: Folklore and Reality''. Yale University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many [[urban legend]]s of people being accidentally buried alive. Legends included elements such as someone entering into the state of [[sopor (sleep)|sopor]] or [[coma]], only to wake up years later and die a horrible death. Other legends tell of coffins opened to find a corpse with a long beard or corpses with the hands raised and palms turned upward. Of note is a legend about the premature burial of Ann Hill Carter Lee, the wife of [[Henry Lee III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis81.html Robert E. Lee's Mother]&lt;/ref&gt;  On his deathbed in 1799, [[George Washington]] made his attendants promise not to bury him for two days.

Literature found fertile ground in exploring the natural fear of being buried alive. One of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s horror stories, "[[The Premature Burial]]", is about a person suffering from taphophobia. Other Poe stories about premature burial are "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]"—and to a lesser extent, "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]".

Fear of being buried alive was elaborated to the extent that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements for the construction of a [[safety coffin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 A Short History of Security Coffins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927090943/http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure this would be avoided (e.g., glass lids for observation, ropes to bells for signaling, and breathing pipes for survival until rescued).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmlegal.com/wcoffin.html Improved burial case]&lt;/ref&gt;

An urban legend states that the sayings "Saved by the bell" and "Dead ringer" are both derived from the notion of having a rope attached to a bell outside the coffin that could alert people that the recently buried person is not yet deceased; these theories have been proven a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=David|title=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=75–77|isbn=978-0-19-537557-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although greater public confidence in the medical profession and its ability to diagnose death accurately has seen a reduction in fear of premature burial after the early 20th century there have been periods of public alarm in recent decades after medical errors in diagnosing death were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bondeson |first1=Jan |title=Buried Alive: The Terrifying History of Our Most Primal Fear |date=17 March 2002 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=London |isbn=978-0393322224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taphophobia may remain common in some parts of the world.  For example, a study of Pakistani women found severe taphophobia in one third of subjects with mental illness and a mild degree of this fear in half of the controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bajwa |first1=Munaza |title=Prevalence and factors associated with phobias among women |journal=Asean Journal of Psychiatry |date=2014 |volume=15 |issue=2 |page=140–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rare in the developed world, a recent study reported three cases of taphophobia among older people in the west of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanous |first1=S. |last2=O’Keeffe |first2=S.T. |title=Not yet dead and buried!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

'''Thalidomide''', sold under the brand name '''Immunoprin''', among others, is an [[immunotherapy|immunomodulatory drug]] and the prototype of the [[Discovery and development of thalidomide and its analogs|thalidomide class of drugs]]. Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers ([[multiple myeloma]]) and of a complication of [[leprosy]].

&lt;!-- History --&gt;
Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in [[West Germany]] under the trade name '''Contergan'''. The German drug company [[Grünenthal|Chemie Grünenthal]] developed and sold the drug. Primarily prescribed as a [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]], thalidomide also claimed to cure "[[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[gastritis]], and tension".&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Marylin T. | title = Thalidomide Embryopathy: A Model for the Study of Congenital Incomitant Horizontal Strabismus | journal = Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society | year = 1991 | volume = 81 | pages = 623–674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, it was used against [[nausea]] and to alleviate [[morning sickness]] in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an [[over the counter|over-the-counter]] drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with [[phocomelia]] (malformation of the limbs). Only 40% of these children survived.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"&gt;{{cite web | first = Peter | last = Hofland | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://oncozine.com/reversal-of-fortune-how-a-vilified-drug-became-a-life-saving-agent-in-the-war-against-cancer/ | title = Reversal of Fortune: How a Vilified Drug Became a Life-saving Agent in the "War" Against Cancer | work = Onco'Zine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Oxford Companion to the Body | last = Cuthbert | first = Alan | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198524038.001.0001/acref-9780198524038 | doi = 10.1093/acref/9780198524038.001.0001 | isbn = 9780198524038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.&lt;ref name="The chemical industry"&gt;{{cite book | last = Heaton | first = C.

==Contraindications==
Thalidomide should not be used by people who are breast feeding or pregnant, trying to conceive a child, or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies. The prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used, and regular pregnancy tests must be administered.   Some people are allergic to thalidomide and should not take it.  It should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis B.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of thalidomide side effects}}
Thalidomide [[Teratogen|causes birth defects]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=toxmech2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SW | title = Chiral toxicology: it's the same thing...only different | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–30 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19414517 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfp097 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable  [[risk evaluation and mitigation strategy]] that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to men and women both, as the drug can be transmitted in sperm.&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive [[Thrombosis|blood clots]]. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[lymphopenia]], and risks that blood will not clot via [[thrombocytopenia]].  There is also a risk of [[anemia]] via lack of red blood cells.  The drug can also damage nerves, causing [[peripheral neuropathy]] that may be irreversible.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[pulmonary hypertension]], and changes in heart rhythm including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[bradycardia]] and [[atrioventricular block]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

It can cause [[liver damage]] and severe skin reactions like [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]].  It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery.   As it kills cancer cells, it can cause [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. Thalidomide can [[Amenorrhea|prevent menstruation]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Other than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Common (reported by 1-10% of people) adverse effects include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

=== Interactions ===
There are no expected [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes.  It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.&lt;ref name = TGA&gt;{{cite web|title=THALOMID® CAPSULES|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Celgene Pty Limited|date=21 June 2013|access-date=17 January 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&amp;id=CP-2010-PI-03581-3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.&lt;ref name = TGA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's [[Teratology|teratogenic]] action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000.&lt;ref name=Stephens2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ | title = Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1489–99 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10799645 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 the main theories were inhibition of the process of [[angiogenesis]], its inhibition of [[cereblon]], a [[ubiquitin ligase]], and its ability to generate [[reactive oxygen species]] which in turn kill cells.&lt;ref name=Vargesson2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargesson N | title = Thalidomide-induced teratogenesis: history and mechanisms | journal = Birth Defects Research.

Thalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two [[enantiomer]]s; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

Thalidomide is [[Racemic mixture|racemic]]; while the S-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can [[Racemization|racemize]] to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the [[chiral centre]], which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent.

==History ==
Thalidomide was [[drug discovery|discovered]] by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal (now [[Grünenthal GmbH]]) around 1953.   The company had been set up as a soap maker just after WWII ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program. In the course of preparing [[reagents]] for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product, that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of [[glutethimide]], a [[sedative]], and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug; the result was thalidomide.  The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter|title=Drug discovery : a history|date=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|page=367|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective [[antiemetic]] that had an inhibitory effect on [[morning sickness]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks ME, Macpherson GR, Figg WD | title = Thalidomide | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9423 | pages = 1802–11 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15172781 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16308-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began marketing it under the trade name Contergan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grunenthal.com/about-us/history Grünenthal: Where we come from].

During this time period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt; Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the [[placental barrier]] and harm the developing fetus,&lt;ref name="The chemical industry"/&gt; even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Rouquette (1957) cited by {{cite journal | vauthors = Landesman-Dwyer S | title = Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome | journal = Applied Research in Mental Retardation | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–63 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7149705 | doi = 10.1016/0270-3092(82)90018-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that [[peripheral neuritis]] developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelsey FO | title = Events after thalidomide | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 1201–5 | year = 1967 | pmid = 5235007 | doi = 10.1177/00220345670460061201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, while initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for [[Teratology|teratogenic]] deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public.&lt;ref name="50year"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thalidomide: The Fifty Year Fight (no longer available)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLbhOyLLMY|access-date=13 September 2015|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in [[West Germany]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The regulatory authorities in [[East Germany]] did not approve thalidomide.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt; One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for [[teratogenic]] effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref name="VFA"&gt;[http://www.vfa.de/de/arzneimittel-forschung/artikel-arzneimittel-forschung/teratogenitaet.html VFA: teratogenic effects] 6.

In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd (now part of [[Diageo plc]]), marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for [[morning sickness]] throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that "Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country."&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt; Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid-1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under at least 37 different trade names.

In the U.S., representatives from ''Chemie Grünenthal'' approached ''[[Smith, Kline &amp; French]]'' (SKF), now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) shows that, as part of its in-licensing approach, ''Smith, Kline and French'' conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the United States involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by ''Chemie Grünenthal'' to be "sleep inducing", the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, ''Chemie Grünenthal'', in 1958, reached an agreement with ''William S Merrell Company'' in Cincinnati, Ohio, ([[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|later Richardson-Merrell]], now part of [[Sanofi]]), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt;

The U.S. FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer [[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|Richardson-Merrell]] had applied for its approval in September 1960.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The official in charge of the FDA review, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | title = Report | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512235601/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | archive-date = 12 May 2009 | date = May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JF | title = Canadian Thalidomide Experience | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 89 | issue =  | pages = 987–92 | date = November 1963 | pmid = 14076167 | pmc = 1921912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt; It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, Israeli physician [[Jacob Sheskin]] administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited [[Erythema nodosum|erythema nodosum leprosum&amp;nbsp;(ENL)]], a painful skin condition, one of the complications of [[leprosy]]. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening.

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castilla EE, Ashton-Prolla P, Barreda-Mejia E, Brunoni D, Cavalcanti DP, Correa-Neto J, Delgadillo JL, Dutra MG, Felix T, Giraldo A, Juarez N, Lopez-Camelo JS, Nazer J, Orioli IM, Paz JE, Pessoto MA, Pina-Neto JM, Quadrelli R, Rittler M, Rueda S, Saltos M, Sánchez O, Schüler L | title = Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America | journal = Teratology | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–7 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9098920 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199702)55:2&lt;156::AID-TERA6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests.

In 1998 the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.&lt;ref name="nyt-fda"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html | title = Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen | newspaper = New York Times | first = Sheryl Gay | last = Stolberg | name-list-format = vanc | access-date=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that [[Celgene Corporation]], which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name ''Thalomid'', establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.&lt;ref name="nyt-fda"/&gt;

In 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of [[clofazimine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy|last=Anon|work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |access-date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer treatment===
Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Kyle&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 2962–72 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18332230 | pmc = 2265446 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-10-078022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Kyle/&gt;

[[Judah Folkman]] pioneered studies into the role of [[angiogenesis]] (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that [[solid tumors]] could not expand without it.&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;{{cite web | first = Patricia K | last = Donahoe | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/folkman-judah.pdf | title = Judah Folkman: 1933–2008.

After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed [[multiple myeloma]] patients.&lt;ref name=Beilenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-thalidomide|publisher=National Cancer Institute|access-date=8 January 2012|title=FDA Approval for Thalidomide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Birth defects crisis===
[[Image:NCP14053.jpg|thumb|Baby born to a mother who had taken thalidomide while pregnant]]
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with [[deformities]] such as [[phocomelia]] as a consequence of thalidomide use.&lt;ref name="Bren"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bren L | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer|publisher =U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =2001-02-28 | access-date =2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days gestation.&lt;ref name="50year"/&gt;

It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000&lt;ref name="nyt-answers"&gt;{{cite news|author = Zimmer C | title = Answers Begin to Emerge on How Thalidomide Caused Defects | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16limb.html?ref=science&amp;pagewanted=all | quote = As they report in the current issue of Science, a protein known as cereblon latched on tightly to the thalidomide | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = March 15, 2010|access-date = 2010-03-21 | authorlink = Carl Zimmer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to 100,000.&lt;ref name="50year"/&gt; Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267 |title=Turning Points of History–Prescription for Disaster |publisher=History Television |access-date=24 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929135332/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8458855.stm|title=Apology for thalidomide survivors|date=14 January 2010  |publisher=BBC News|access-date=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s, perhaps even into the 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015, there were 250–300 living victims of thalidomide in Spain.&lt;ref name ="SundayTimesMag Spain"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Scott | first1 = Caroline | last2 = Haupt | first2 = Oliver | name-list-format = vanc | date = 3 May 2015 | title = The forgotten victims | url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1551306.ece | newspaper = [[The Sunday Times Magazine]] | pages = 12–19 | access-date = 8 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Australian obstetrician [[William McBride (doctor)|William McBride]] took credit for raising the alarm about thalidomide it was a [[midwife]] who first suspected the drug was causing birth defects in the babies of patients under his care at [[Crown Street Women's Hospital]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-06-29/thalidomide-william-mcbride-flawed-character-norman-swan/9920608&lt;/ref&gt; German [[paediatrician]] [[Widukind Lenz]], who also suspected the link, is credited with conducting the scientific research that proved thalidomide was causing birth defects in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1002.html|title=Widukind Lenz|last=Anon|work=who name it?|publisher= Ole Daniel Enersen|access-date=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="40 years on"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2031459.stm|title=Thalidomide:40 years on|last=Anon|work=BBC news|publisher=BBC|access-date=2009-05-01 | date=2002-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |title=Report of Thalidomide at University of New South Wales |publisher=Embryology.med.unsw.edu.au |access-date=2012-12-30 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028204857/http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |archive-date=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was eventually struck off the Australian medical register in 1993 for scientific fraud.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/thalidomide-doctor-guilty-of-medical-fraud-william-mcbride-who-exposed-the-danger-of-one-anti-nausea-1474190.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further animal tests were conducted by Dr George Somers, Chief Pharmacologist of [[Distillers Company]] in Britain, which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somers GF | date = 1963 | title = The foetal toxicity of thalidomide | journal = Proc.

In [[East Germany]], the head of the central pharmacy control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of [[glutamic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/120351.html |title=DDR-Bürger schliefen ohne Contergan |trans-title=East German citizens slept without thalidomide |language=German |work=[[Neues Deutschland]] |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in [[West Germany]], it took some time before the increase in [[dysmelia]] at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958, Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in [[Bayreuth]], wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; Based on this, [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] [[Whip (politics)|whip]] [[Erich Mende]] requested an official statement from the federal government.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide.&lt;ref name=daeb&gt;{{cite journal |archive-url=http://www.contergan-ag50.de/Seiten/presse/20111125-27_artikel/2007_Die_Contergan-Katastrophe_Die_truegerische_Sicherheit_der_harten_Daten-Deutsches_Aerzteblatt.pdf |archive-date=December 6, 2011|dead-url=no|url=http://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/57224/ |access-date=June 6, 2013 |first=Klaus-Dieter |last=Thomann | name-list-format = vanc |title=Die Contergan-Katastrophe: Die trügerische Sicherheit der "harten" Daten |trans-title=The thalidomide disaster: The false security of 'hard' data|language=German|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=41 |pages=A–2778 / B–2454 / C–2382}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazi regime with its [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various [[Action T4|crimes]], western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor [[congenital disorder]]s in a similarly strict way.&lt;ref Name ="th"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Zichner L, Rauschmann MA, Thomann KD | title = Die Contergankatastrophe eine Bilanz nach 40 Jahren | trans-title = The thalidomide catastrophe takes stock after 40 years | language = German | date = 2005 | publisher = Steinkopff | location = Darmstadt | isbn = 978-3-7985-1479-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful.

Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the [[Austria]]n pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of [[prescription medication]] and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|title=10.000 Fälle von Missbildungen|trans-title=10,000 cases of malformations|language=German|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|access-date=June 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814144428/http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|archive-date=2009-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] [[M.D.]] withstood pressure from the [[Marion Merrell Dow|Richardson-Merrell]] company and refused [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed.&lt;ref name="Bren" /&gt; This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, over 2.5 million tablets had been distributed to over 1,000 physicians during a clinical testing program. It is estimated that nearly 20,000 patients, several hundred of whom were pregnant women, were given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative, and at least 17 children were consequently born in America with thalidomide-associated deformities.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/thalidomide-the-connectio_b_8881702.html|title=Thalidomide: The Connection Between a Statue in Trafalgar Square, a 1960s Children's Show Host and the Abortion Debate|last=Braun|first=Whitny | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-12-29 | website = Huffington Post | access-date = 2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php |title=Bendectin Part 1: How a Commonly Used Drug Caused Birth Defects |last=Mekdeci |first=Betty| name-list-format = vanc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218004638/http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php |archive-date=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman named [[Sherri Finkbine]] publicized the serious problems of thalidomide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/body-health/reproduction/|title=Click - Debating Reproductive Rights - Reproductive Rights and Feminism, History of Abortion Battle, History of Abortion Debate, Roe v.

She had later learned that thalidomide was causing fetal deformities. She wanted to abort her pregnancy, but the laws of Arizona allowed abortion only if the mother's life was in danger. Finkbine traveled to [[Sweden]] to have the abortion, which was expensive for her. Thalidomide was found to have deformed the fetus.&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

===Aftermath of scandal===
The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs.&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt; Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. "The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities."&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;

====Germany====
In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. 
After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grünenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.

On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Grünenthal [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until 28 May 2013, apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech on the occasion of the inauguration of Thalidomide-Memorial|url=http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|website=Grünenthal GmbH Website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901184544/http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|archive-date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50&amp;nbsp;years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticized the company for not compensating victims.

====Australia====
Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, led an Australian [[class action]] lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Grünenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] dismissed Grünenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-19/australian-thalidomide-victims-win-hearing-bid/3738116|title=Australian thalidomide victims win right for hearing|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2012, Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petrie |first=Andrea | name-list-format = vanc |date=19 July 2012 |title=Landmark thalidomide payout offers hope for thousands |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/landmark-thalidomide-payout-offers-hope-for-thousands-20120718-22apa.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=14 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the Supreme Court of Victoria endorsed the settlement of $89 million AUD to 107 victims of the drug in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farnsworth|first=Sarah| name-list-format = vanc |title=Supreme Court formally approves $89m compensation payout for Thalidomide victims|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-07/supreme-court-formally-approves-2489m-class-action-for-thalido/5245034|access-date=14 February 2017|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Australian Associated Press]]|title=Thalidomide survivors' compensation approved|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/9698482/Thalidomide-survivors-compensation-approved|access-date=14 February 2017|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
The drug thalidomide's birth defects in children affected many people's lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called [[The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]], a group of 120 Canadian survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren R | title = Living in a world with thalidomide: a dose of reality | journal = FDA Consumer | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 40 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11444250 | url = http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2001/201_word.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090624192258/http://www.thalidomide.ca/tvac-mission/ The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt;

The effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology.&lt;ref name=pmid12909394&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Racz WJ, Ecobichon DJ, Baril M | title = On-line sources of toxicological information in Canada | journal = Toxicology | volume = 190 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–14 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12909394 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00192-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances.&lt;ref name=pmid12909394/&gt; Thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.

According to [[W5 (TV series)|Canadian news magazine program ''W5'']], most, but not all, victims  of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the [[Government of Canada]]. Excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The plight of the thalidomide 'sample babies' who don't qualify for gov't compensation |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/the-plight-of-the-thalidomide-sample-babies-who-don-t-qualify-for-gov-t-compensation-1.3176590 |work=W5 |access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[Image:Frances Oldham Kelsey and John F. Kennedy.jpg|thumb|upright|1962: FDA pharmacologist [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] receives the [[President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] for blocking sale of thalidomide in the United States.]]
For denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award, given annually to an FDA staff member. This came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Gardiner | last = Harris | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/health/14kelsey.html?_r=1&amp;8dpc|title=The Public's Quiet Savior From Harmful Medicines|date=13 September 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiologist [[Helen B. Taussig]] learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and in 1967, testified before Congress on this matter after a trip to Germany where she worked with infants with [[phocomelia]] (severe limb deformities). As a result of her efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States and Europe.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Change in drug regulations===
The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Years: The Kefauver-Harris Amendments|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm320924.htm|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]]|access-date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (U.S.), [[Directive 65/65/EEC1]] (E.U.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thalidomide |url=http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |publisher=[[National Health Service (England)]] |access-date=6 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020225/http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |archive-date=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medicines Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conroy S, McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Unlicensed and off label drug use in neonates | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = F142–4; discussion F144–5 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10325794 | doi = 10.1136/fn.80.2.F142 | pmc=1720896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society | title = The  evolution of pharmacy, Theme E, Level 3 Thalidomide and its aftermath | url = https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014114005/https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 14 October 2011 | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing.&lt;ref name=Bren /&gt; The FDA subsequently initiated the [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation]] to reclassify drugs already on the market.

==Research==
Research efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide.

===Thalidomide analogs===
{{Main|Development of analogs of thalidomide}}
The exploration of the [[antiangiogenic]] and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10447943"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah JH, Swartz GM, Papathanassiu AE, Treston AM, Fogler WE, Madsen JW, Green SJ | title = Synthesis and enantiomeric separation of 2-phthalimidino-glutaric acid analogues: potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 16 | pages = 3014–7 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10447943 | doi = 10.1021/jm990083y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11740816&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Amato RJ, Lentzsch S, Anderson KC, Rogers MS | title = Mechanism of action of thalidomide and 3-aminothalidomide in multiple myeloma | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 597–601 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11740816 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-7754(01)90031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as [[lenalidomide]], that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects&amp;nbsp;— except for greater [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao KV | title = Lenalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 1799–807 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17724360 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp070029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for [[lenalidomide]] (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, [[pomalidomide]], is now FDA approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=pomalidomide&amp;submit=Search |title=Search of: pomalidomide|publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[apremilast]] was approved by the FDA in March 2014.

Interest turned to [[pomalidomide]], a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of thalidomide marketed by [[Celgene Corporation|Celgene]]. It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent &lt;ref name=pmid11740816/&gt;  and also acts as an [[immunomodulator]].

'''''Turritopsis dohrnii''''', the '''immortal jellyfish''', is a [[species]] of small, [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]] [[jellyfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavestrello|first=Giorgio |author2=Christian Sommer |author3=Michele Sarà|year=1992|title=Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|journal=Scientia Marina|volume=56|issue=2–3|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="piraino-96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piraino|first=Stefano|author2=F.

It is one of the few known cases of [[animal]]s capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual.

Like most other [[hydrozoan]]s, ''T. dohrnii'' begin their life as free-swimming tiny [[larva]]e known as [[planula]]. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of [[polyp]]s that are attached to the sea-floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones. The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If a ''T. dohrnii'' jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; It does this through the cell development process of [[transdifferentiation]], which alters the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated state of the cells]] and transforms them into new types of cells.

Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|year=2006|accessdate=2009-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2010-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice individuals can still die. In nature, most ''Turritopsis'' are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage, without reverting to the polyp form.&lt;ref name="National Geographic News"&gt;{{cite web

The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes ''T. dohrnii'' an important target of basic biological, [[Ageing|aging]] and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencepub.net/stem/stem0504/007_A00288stem050414_49_53.pdf|doi=10.7537/marsscj050414.07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "immortal jellyfish" was formerly classified as ''[[Turritopsis nutricula|T. nutricula]]''.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt;

== Description ==

The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is bell-shaped, with a maximum diameter of about {{convert|4.5|mm|in}} and is about as tall as it is wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P. L.|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=1961|volume=40|pages=1–469|doi=10.1017/s0025315400007347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline26012009" /&gt; The jelly in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin, except for some thickening at the apex. The relatively large stomach is bright red and has a cruciform shape in cross section. Young specimens 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter have only eight tentacles evenly spaced out along the edge,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martell|first=L.|last2=Piraino|first2=S.|last3=Gravili|first3=C.|last4=Boero|first4=F.|date=2016-07-02|title=Life cycle, morphology and medusa ontogenesis of Turritopsis dohrnii (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa)|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|volume=83|issue=3|pages=390–399|doi=10.1080/11250003.2016.1203034|issn=1125-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas adult specimens have 80–90 tentacles. The medusa (jellyfish) is free-living in the plankton. Dense [[nerve net]] cells are also present in the [[epidermis]] in the cap. They form a large ring-like structure above the radial cannal which is commonly presented in cnidarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koizumi|first=Osamu|last2=Hamada|first2=Shun|last3=Minobe|first3=Sumiko|last4=Hamaguchi-Hamada|first4=Kayoko|last5=Kurumata-Shigeto|first5=Mami|last6=Nakamura|first6=Masaru|last7=Namikawa|first7=Hiroshi|title=The nerve ring in cnidarians: its presence and structure in hydrozoan medusae|journal=Zoology|volume=118|issue=2|pages=79–88|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2014.10.001|pmid=25498132|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Turritopsis dohrnii'' also has a bottom-living polyp form, or hydroid, which consists of [[stolon]]s that run along the substrate, and upright branches with feeding polyps that can produce medusa buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=C. McLean|title=Hydroids of the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1937|pages=201 plus 44 plates}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polyps develop over a few days into tiny 1&amp;nbsp;mm medusae, which are liberated and swim free from the parent hydroid colony.

Images of both the medusa and polyp of the closely related species ''[[Turritopsis rubra]]'' from [[New Zealand]] can be found online.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |title=Turritopsis rubra |last=Schuchert |first=Peter |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912180002/http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a recent genetic study, it was thought that ''Turritopsis rubra'' and ''Turritopsis nutricula'' were the same.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt; It is not known whether or not ''T. rubra'' medusae can also transform back into polyps.

== Distribution and invasion ==

''Turritopsis'' is believed to have originated in the [[Pacific]] but has spread all over the world through trans-Arctic migrations, and has speciated into several populations that are easy to distinguish morphologically, but whose species distinctions have recently been verified by a study and comparison of mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences.&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miglietta|first=M.

== Life cycle ==

The eggs develop in gonads of female medusae, which are located in the walls of the manubrium (stomach). Mature eggs are presumably spawned and fertilized in the sea by sperm produced and released by male medusae, as is the case for most hydromedusae, although the related species ''Turritopsis rubra'' seems to retain fertilized eggs until the planula stage.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"/&gt; Fertilized eggs develop into [[planula]] larvae, which settle onto the sea-floor (or even the rich marine communities that live on floating docks), and develop into polyp colonies ([[hydroids]]). The hydroids bud new jellyfishes, which are released at about one millimetre in size and then grow and feed in the plankton, becoming sexually mature after a few weeks (the exact duration depends on the ocean temperature; at {{convert|20|C|F}} it is 25 to 30 days and at {{convert|22|C|F}} it is 18 to 22 days).&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt; Medusae of ''T. dohrnii'' are able to survive between 14&amp;nbsp;°C  and 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biological immortality ===

Most jellyfish species have a relatively fixed life-span, which varies by species from hours to many months (long-lived mature jellyfish spawn every day or night; the time is also fairly fixed and species-specific).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=C. E.|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is the only form known to have developed the ability to return to a polyp state, by a specific transformation process that requires the presence of certain cell types (tissue from both the jellyfish bell surface and the circulatory canal system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/meet-the-worlds-only-immortal-animal/|title = Meet the world's only immortal animal|date = December 5, 2008|accessdate = January 10, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful laboratory experiments have revealed that all stages of the medusae, from newly released to fully mature individuals, can transform back into polyps under the conditions of starvation, sudden temperature change, reduction of salinity and artificial damage of the bell with forceps or scissor.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; The transforming [[medusae|medusa]] is characterized first by deterioration of the bell, mesoglea and tentacles. All immature medusa (with 12 tentacles at most) then turned into a [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]-like stage and then transformed into [[stolon]]s and polyps. However, about 20%-40% of mature medusa went into stolons and polyps stage without passing cyst-like stage. Polyps were formed after 2 days since stolons had developed and fed on food. Polyps further multiply by growing additional stolons, branches and then polyps, to form colonial [[hydroids]]. In the experiment, they would eventually transform into stolons and polyps and begin their lives once again even without suffering from environment changes or injury.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Diagram of the transformation procedure can be found at the further reading.

This ability to reverse the biotic cycle (in response to adverse conditions) is unique in the [[animals|animal kingdom]], and allows the jellyfish to bypass death, rendering ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' potentially [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. The process has not been observed in their natural habitat, in part because the process is quite rapid, and because field observations at the right moment are unlikely.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Regardless, most individual medusae are likely to fall victim to the general hazards of life as [[plankton]], including being eaten by predators or succumbing to disease.

The species' cell development method of transdifferentiation has inspired scientists to find a way to make stem cells using this process for renewing damaged or dead tissue in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimberu|first=Peniel M.|title=Immortal Jellyfish Provides Clues for Regenerative Medicine|url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/04/25/immortal-jellyfish-provides-clues-for-regenerative-medicine/|publisher=Singularity Hub|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic analysis ==
Genomic analyses such as [[sequence analysis]] on [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] DNA have been employed to investigate its lifecycle. mRNA analysis of each life stage showed that a stage-specific gene in the medusae stage is expressed tenfold more than in other stages. This gene is relative to a [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signal]] that can induce a regeneration process upon injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Catriona Y.|last2=Nusse|first2=Roel|date=2004-10-08|title=The wnt signaling pathway in development and disease|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=781–810|doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.113126|pmid=15473860|issn=1081-0706|citeseerx=10.1.1.322.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=Yoshinori|last2=Watanabe|first2=Takashi|last3=Takazawa|first3=Masaki|last4=Ohara|first4=Osamu|last5=Kubota|first5=Shin|date=2016-08-01|title=De Novo Assembly of the Transcriptome of Turritopsis, a Jellyfish that Repeatedly Rejuvenates|journal=Zoological Science|volume=33|issue=4|pages=366–371|doi=10.2108/zs150186|pmid=27498796|issn=0289-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] homologs and protein homologs identified ''[[Nemopsis bachei]]'' as the species' closest relative. None of the closely related species show biological immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devarapalli|first=Pratap|last2=Science|first2=Department of Genomic|last3=Kerala|first3=Central University of|last4=Campus|first4=Riverside Transit|last5=Science|first5=Opp: Nehru College of Arts and|last6=17|first6=NH|last7=Padanakkad|last8=Nileshwer|last9=Kasaragod|title=The conserved mitochondrial gene distribution in relatives of Turritopsis nutricula, an immortal jellyfish|url=http://www.bioinformation.net/010/97320630010586.htm|journal=Bioinformation|volume=10|issue=9|pages=586–591|doi=10.6026/97320630010586|pmid=25352727|pmc=4209368|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culturing==

Keeping ''T. dohrnii'' in captivity is quite difficult. Currently only one scientist, Shin Kubota from [[Kyoto University]], has managed to sustain a group of these jellyfish for a prolonged period of time. The plankton must be inspected daily to ensure that they have properly digested the [[Brine shrimp|Artemia cysts]] they are being fed.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; 
Kubota reported that during a two-year period, his colony rebirthed itself 11 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S Kubota|title=Repeating rejuvenation in Turritopsis, an immortal hydrozoan (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa)|journal=Biogeography|issn=1345-0662|year=2011|volume=13|number=|pages=101–103|pmid=|url=http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029093746/http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubota regularly appears on Japanese television to talk about his immortal jellyfish and has recorded several songs about them.&lt;ref name=nytm&gt;{{cite news |last=Rich|first=Nathaniel|title=Can a jellyfish unlock the secret of immortality? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/can-a-jellyfish-unlock-the-secret-of-immortality.html?src=me&amp;ref=general|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=November 28, 2012|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
