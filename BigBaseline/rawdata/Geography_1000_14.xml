A '''cave survey''' is a [[map]] of all or part of a [[cave]] system, which may be produced to meet differing standards of accuracy depending on the cave conditions and equipment available underground. Cave surveying and [[cartography]], i.e. the creation of an accurate, detailed map, is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave and is a fundamental part of [[speleology]]. Surveys can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on [[speleogenesis]], provide a spatial reference for other areas of scientific study and assist visitors with route-finding.

Traditionally, cave surveys are produced in two-dimensional form due to the confines of print, but given the three-dimensional environment inside a cave, modern techniques using [[computer aided design]] are increasingly used to allow a more realistic representation of a cave system.

==History==
[[File:Marble Arch Survey (Brodrick, H., 1908).png|thumb|right|1908 survey of [[Marble Arch Caves]] by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club|alt=Hand-drawn map of a cave, showing meandering underground river passage as well as surface topography including large shakeholes.]]
The first known plan of a cave dates from 1546, and was of a man-made cavern in tufa called the Stufe di Nerone (Nero's Oven) in [[Pozzuoli]] near [[Naples]] in Italy. The first natural cave to be mapped was the [[Baumann's Cave|Baumannshöhle]] in [[Germany]], of which a sketch from 1656 survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science |last= Gunn |first=J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn= 978-1-57958-399-6|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early survey dates from before 1680, and was made by [[John Aubrey]] of Long Hole in the [[Cheddar Gorge]]. It consists of an elevational section of the cave. Numerous other surveys of caves were made in the following years, though most are sketches and are limited in accuracy. The first cave that is likely to have been accurately surveyed with instruments is the [[Grotte de Miremont]] in [[France]]. This was surveyed by a civil engineer in 1765 and includes numerous cross-sections. [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] was the first person to describe surveying techniques. His surveys were made by having an assistant walk down the passage until they were almost out of sight. Martel would then take a compass bearing to the assistant's light, and measure the distance by pacing up to the assistant. This would equate to a modern-day BCRA Grade 2 survey.

The first cave to have its centreline calculated by a computer is the Fergus River Cave in [[Ireland]], which was plotted by members of the [[UBSS]] in 1964. The software was programmed onto a large university mainframe computer and a paper plot was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nicholson |first1= F.H.|last2=Patmore |first2=D.J. |year= 1965 |title= The Fergus RIver Cave, Co. Clare, Ireland |journal= UBSS Proceedings |volume= 10|issue= 3|page= 285|publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
There are many variations to [[surveying]] methodology, but most are based on a similar set of steps which haven't changed fundamentally in 250 years, although the instruments (compass and tape) have got smaller and more accurate. Since the late 1990s digital instruments such as [[distometers]] have started to change the process, leading to the advent of fully paperless surveying around 2007. The main variation on the normal methodology detailed below have been devices such as LIDAR and SONAR surveyors that produce a point cloud rather than a series of linked stations. Video-based surveying also exists in prototype form.

=== Surveying ===
A survey team begins at a fixed point (such as the cave entrance) and measures a series of consecutive [[sightline|line-of-sight]] measurements between stations. The stations are temporary fixed locations chosen chiefly for their ease of access and clear sight along the cave passage. In some cases, survey stations may be permanently marked to create a fixed reference point to which to return at a later date.

The measurements taken between the stations include:
* direction ([[azimuth]] or [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]) taken with a [[compass]]
* inclination from horizontal (dip) taken with a [[clinometer]]
* distance measured with a low-stretch tape or [[laser rangefinder]]
* optionally, distance to surrounding walls&amp;nbsp;– left, right, up, down (''LRUD'')

Coincident with recording straight-line data, details of passage dimensions, shape, gradual or sudden changes in elevation, the presence or absence of still or flowing water, the location of notable features and the material on the floor are recorded, often by means of a sketch map.

=== Drawing a line-plot ===
Later, the [[cartographer]] analyses the recorded data, converting them into two-dimensional measurements by way of [[geometry|geometrical]] calculations. From them he/she creates a ''line-plot''; a scaled geometrical representation of the path through the cave.

=== Finalising ===
The cartographer then draws details around the line-plot, using the additional data of passage dimensions, water flow and floor/wall [[topography]] recorded at the time, to produce a completed cave survey. Cave surveys drawn on paper are often presented in two-dimensional ''plan'' and/or ''profile'' views, while computer surveys may simulate three dimensions. Although primarily designed to be functional, some [[caver]]s consider cave surveys as an art form.{{Who|date=December 2011}}

== Hydrolevelling ==
Hydrolevelling is an alternative to measuring depth with clinometer and tape that has a long history of use in Russia.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Degtjarev |first1=Alexander  |last2=Snetkov |first2=Eugene |last3=Gurjanov |first3=Alexey |title=Obtaining accurate cave depths by hydrolevelling |journal=Compass Points |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association|BCRA]] Cave Survey Group |issue=38 |date=July 2007 |pages=8–12 |url=http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP38/CP38.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1361-8962 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is regularly used in building construction for finding two points with the same height, as in levelling a floor. In the simplest case, a tube with both ends open is used, attached to a strip of wood, and the tube is filled with water and the depth at each end marked. In Russia, measuring the depth of caves by hydrolevelling began in the 1970s, and was considered to be the most accurate means of measuring depth despite the difficulties in using the cumbersome equipment of the time. Interest in the method has been revived following the discovery of [[Voronya Cave|Voronja]] on the [[Arabica Massif]] in the [[Caucasus]]&amp;nbsp;– currently the world's deepest cave.

The hydrolevel device used in recent Voronja expeditions comprises a {{convert|50|m|ft|sing=on}} transparent tube filled with water, which is coiled or placed on a reel. A rubber glove which acts as a reservoir is placed on one end of the tube, and a metal box with a transparent window is placed on the other. A diver's digital wristwatch with a depth gauge function is submerged in the box. If the rubber glove is placed on one station and the box with the depth gauge is placed on a lower one, then the hydrostatic pressure between the two points depends only on the difference in heights and the density of the water, i.e. the route of the tube does not affect the pressure in the box. Reading the depth gauge gives the apparent depth change between the higher and lower station. Depth changes are 'apparent' because depth gauges are calibrated for sea water, and the hydrolevel is filled with fresh water. Therefore, a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes. Adding the readings for consecutive pairs of stations gives the total depth of the cave.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro /&gt;

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy, or ''grade'', of a cave survey is dependent on the methodology of measurement. A common survey grading system is that created by the [[British Cave Research Association]] in the 1960s, which uses a scale of six grades.&lt;ref name=BCRA-grades&gt;{{cite web |title=BCRA Surveying Grades |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association]] |url=http://www.bcra.org.uk/surveying/ |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BCRA grading system ===

==== BCRA gradings for a cave line survey ====
; Grade 1
: Sketch of low accuracy where no measurements have been made
; Grade 2 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
: May be used, if necessary, to describe a sketch that is intermediate in accuracy between Grade 1 &amp; 3
; Grade 3
:A rough magnetic survey. Horizontal &amp; vertical angles measured to ±2.5&amp;nbsp;°; distances measured to ±50&amp;nbsp;cm; station position error less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 4 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
:May be used, if necessary, to describe a survey that fails to attain all the requirements of Grade 5 but is more accurate than a Grade 3 survey.
;Grade 5
:A Magnetic survey. Horizontal and vertical angles measured to ±1&amp;nbsp;°; distances should be observed and recorded to the nearest centimetre and station positions identified to less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 6
:A magnetic survey that is more accurate than grade 5, (see note 5).
;Grade X
:A survey that is based primarily on the use of a theodolite or total station instead of a compass, (see notes 6 and 10 below).

===== Notes =====
# The above table is a summary, omitting some technical details and definitions; the definitions of the survey grades given above must be read in conjunction with these notes.
# In all cases it is necessary to follow the spirit of the definition and not just the letter.
# To attain Grade 3 it is necessary to use a clinometer in passages having appreciable slope.
# To attain Grade 5 it is essential for instruments to be properly calibrated, and all measurements must be taken from a point within a 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter sphere centred on the survey station.
# A Grade 6 survey requires the compass to be used at the limit of possible accuracy, i.e. accurate to ±0.5&amp;nbsp;°; clinometer readings must be to the same accuracy. Station position error must be less than ±2.5&amp;nbsp;cm, which will require the use of tripods at all stations or other fixed station markers ('roofhooks').
# A Grade X survey must include on the drawing notes descriptions of the instruments and techniques used, together with an estimate of the probable accuracy of the survey compared with Grade 3, 5 or 6 surveys.
# Grades 2 and 4 are for use only when, at some stage of the survey, physical conditions have prevented the survey from attaining all the requirements for the next higher grade and it is not practical to re-survey.
# Caving organisations, etc., are encouraged to reproduce Table 1 and Table 2 in their own publications; permission is not required from BCRA to do so, but the tables must not be reprinted without these notes.
# Grade X is only potentially more accurate than Grade 6. It should never be forgotten that the theodolite/Total Station is a complex precision instrument that requires considerable training and regular practice if serious errors are not to be made through its use!
# In drawing up, the survey co-ordinates must be calculated and not hand-drawn with scale rule and protractor to obtain Grade 5.

==== BCRA gradings for recording cave passage detail ====
;Class A
:All passage details based on memory.
;Class B
:Passage details estimated and recorded in the cave.
;Class C
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations only.
;Class D
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations and wherever else needed to show significant changes in passage dimensions.

===== Notes =====
# The accuracy of the detail should be similar to the accuracy of the line.
# Normally only one of the following combinations of survey grades should be used: 
#* 1A
#* 3B or 3C
#* 5C or 5D
#* 6D 
#* XA, XB, XC or XD

=== Survey error detection ===
The equipment used to undertake a cave survey continues to improve. The use of computers, inertia systems, and electronic distance finders has been proposed, but few practical underground applications have evolved at present.

Despite these advances, faulty instruments, imprecise measurements, recording errors or other factors may still result in an inaccurate survey, and these errors are often difficult to detect. Some cave surveyors measure each station twice, recording a ''back-sight'' to the previous station in the opposite direction. A back-sight compass reading that is different by 180&amp;nbsp;degrees and a clinometer reading that is the same value but with the reverse direction (positive rather than negative, for example) indicates that the original measurement was accurate.

When a loop within a cave is surveyed back to its starting point, the resulting line-plot should also form a closed loop. Any gap between the first and last stations is called a ''loop-closure error''. If no single error is apparent, one may assume the loop-closure error is due to cumulative inaccuracies, and cave survey software can 'close the loop' by averaging possible errors throughout the loop stations. Loops to test survey accuracy may also be made by surveying across the surface between multiple entrances to the same cave.

The use of a low-frequency cave radio can also verify survey accuracy. A receiving unit on the surface can pinpoint the depth and location of a transmitter in a cave passage by measurement of the geometry of its radio waves. A survey over the surface from the receiver back to the cave entrance forms an artificial loop with the underground survey, whose loop-closure error can then be determined.

In the past, cavers were reluctant to redraw complex cave maps after detecting survey errors. Today, computer cartography can automatically redraw cave maps after data has been corrected.

== Surveying software ==
There are a large number of surveying packages available on various computer platforms, most of which have been developed by cavers with a basis in computer programming. Many of the packages perform particularly well for specific tasks, and as such many cave surveyors will not solely choose one product over another for all cartographic tasks.

A popular program for producing a centerline survey is [[Survex]], which was originally developed by members of the Cambridge University Caving Club for processing survey data from club expeditions to Austria. It was released to the public in 1992. The centerline data can then be exported in various formats and the cave detail drawn in with various other programmes such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Inkscape]]. Other programmes such as 'Tunnel' and [[Therion (software)|Therion]] have full centerline and map editing capabilities. Therion notably, when it closes survey loops, warps the passages to fit over their length, meaning that entire passages  do not have to be redrawn.

Terrestrial LiDAR units are increasing significantly in accuracy and decreasing in price.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Several Caves have been "scanned" using both "time of flight" and "phase shift" LiDAR units.  The differences are in the relative accuracies available to each.  The Oregon Caves National Park, was LiDAR scanned in August 2011, as were the Paisley Caves Archaeological dig sigte in SE Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Both were scanned with a FARO Focus Phase shift scanner with +/-2mm accuracy.  The Oregon Caves were scanned from the main public entrance to the 110 exit and were loop surveyed to the point of beginning.  The data is not yet available for public use, but copies are retained by both the US Park Service and i-TEN Associates in Portland, Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Automated methods==
In recent years an underground geographic positioning technology called [[HORTA (mining)|HORTA]] has been utilized in the [[mining]] industry.  The technology utilizes a [[gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]] to aid in [[three-dimensional|3D]]-position determination.&lt;ref name=cmj2000&gt;
[http://www.canadianminingjournal.com/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000110318&amp;type=Print%20Archives Inco's Innovations], ''Canadian Mining Journal'', April 2000, accessed 2010-12-02. ''"HORTA unit for determining the geographic position underground. HORTA-Honeywell Ore Retrieval and Tunneling Aid-is a box containing a gyro and an accelerometer, originally developed for the U.S. military, that solves the problem of positioning and location underground."&lt;/ref&gt;

Such automated methods have provided a more than fifty-fold increase in underground surveying productivity with more accurate and finer detail maps as well.&lt;ref name=cmj2000/&gt;

[[File:Marine sextant.svg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram of a nautical [[sextant]], a tool used in celestial navigation]]

'''Celestial navigation''', also known as '''astronavigation''', is the ancient and modern practice of [[position fixing]] that enables a navigator to transition through a space without having to rely on estimated calculations, or [[dead reckoning]], to know their position. Celestial [[navigation]] uses "sights", or angular measurements taken between a [[celestial body]] (e.g. the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], a [[planet]], or a [[star]]) and the visible [[horizon]]. The Sun is most commonly used, but navigators can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] whose coordinates are tabulated in the [[nautical almanac]] and air [[almanac]]s.

Celestial navigation is the use of angular measurements (sights) between celestial bodies and the visible horizon to locate one's position in the [[Earth|world]], on land as well as at sea. At a given time, any celestial body is located directly over one point on the Earth's surface. The [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of that point is known as the celestial body's [[apparent place|geographic position]] (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the nautical or air almanac for that year.

The measured angle between the celestial body and the visible horizon is directly related to the distance between the celestial body's GP and the observer's position. After some computations, referred to as [[sight reduction]], this measurement is used to plot a [[position line|line of position]] (LOP) on a [[nautical chart|navigational chart]] or plotting work sheet, the observer's position being somewhere on that line. (The LOP is actually a short [[radius|segment]] of a very large circle on Earth that surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on Earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer's position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at [[Celestial navigation#Example|example]] below).  Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimizes the chance of error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, referred to as the 'altitude-intercept method'.

There are several other methods of celestial navigation that will also provide position-finding using [[sextant]] observations, such as the noon sight, and the more archaic [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]]. [[Joshua Slocum]] used the lunar distance method during the first recorded single-handed circumnavigation of the world. Unlike the altitude-intercept method, the noon sight and lunar distance methods do not require accurate knowledge of time. The altitude-intercept method of celestial navigation requires that the observer know exact Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at the moment of his observation of the celestial body, to the second—since for every four seconds that the time source (commonly a chronometer or, in aircraft, an accurate "[[hack watch]]") is in error, the position will be off by approximately one nautical mile.

==Example==
[[Image:Sun Moon (annotated).gif|right|thumb|300px]]
An example illustrating the concept behind the [[intercept method]] for determining one’s position is shown to the right. (Two other common methods for determining one’s position using celestial navigation are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and [[ex-meridian]] methods.) In the adjacent image, the two circles on the map represent lines of position for the Sun and Moon at 1200 [[GMT]] on October 29, 2005. At this time, a navigator on a ship at sea measured the Moon to be 56 degrees above the horizon using a [[sextant]]. Ten minutes later, the Sun was observed to be 40 degrees above the horizon. Lines of position were then calculated and plotted for each of these observations. Since both the Sun and Moon were observed at their respective angles from the same location, the navigator would have to be located at one of the two locations where the circles cross.

In this case the navigator is either located on the Atlantic Ocean, about {{convert|350|nmi|km}} west of Madeira, or in South America, about {{convert|90|nmi|km}} southwest of Asunción, Paraguay. In most cases, determining which of the two intersections is the correct one is obvious to the observer because they are often thousands of miles apart. As it is unlikely that the ship is sailing across South America, the position in the Atlantic is the correct one. Note that the lines of position in the figure are distorted because of the map’s projection; they would be circular if plotted on a globe.

An observer in the [[Gran Chaco]] point would see the Moon at the left of the Sun, and an observer in the Madeira point would see the  Moon at the right of the Sun.

==Angular measurement==
[[Image:Using sextant swing.gif|thumb|right|300px|Using a marine sextant to measure the altitude of the sun above the horizon]]
Accurate angle measurement evolved over the years. One simple method is to hold the hand above the horizon with one's arm stretched out. The width of the little finger is an angle just over 1.5 degrees elevation at extended arm's length and can be used to estimate the elevation of the sun from the horizon plane and therefore estimate the time until sunset. The need for more accurate measurements led to the development of a number of increasingly accurate instruments, including the [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], [[Mariner's astrolabe|astrolabe]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]]. The sextant and octant are most accurate because they measure angles from the horizon, eliminating errors caused by the placement of an instrument's pointers, and because their dual mirror system cancels relative motions of the instrument, showing a steady view of the object and horizon.

Navigators measure distance on the globe in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[arcminute]]s and [[arcsecond]]s. A [[nautical mile]] is defined as 1852 meters, but is also (not accidentally) one minute of angle along a meridian on the Earth. Sextants can be read accurately to within 0.2 arcminutes, so the observer's position can be determined within (theoretically) 0.2 miles, about 400 yards (370 m). Most ocean navigators, shooting from a moving platform, can achieve a practical accuracy of 1.5 miles (2.8&amp;nbsp;km), enough to navigate safely when out of sight of land.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Practical navigation==

Practical celestial navigation usually requires a [[marine chronometer]] to measure time, a [[sextant]] to measure the angles, an [[Nautical almanac|almanac]] giving schedules of the coordinates of celestial objects, a set of sight reduction tables to help perform the height and [[azimuth]] computations, and a chart of the region. [[File:Two ship's officers 'shoot' in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Two nautical ship officers "shoot" in one morning with the sextant, the sun altitude]]&lt;/small&gt; With sight reduction tables, the only calculations required are addition and subtraction. Small handheld computers, laptops and even scientific calculators enable modern navigators to "reduce" sextant sights in minutes, by automating all the calculation and/or data lookup steps. Most people can master simpler celestial navigation procedures after a day or two of instruction and practice, even using manual calculation methods.

Modern practical navigators usually use celestial navigation in combination with [[satellite navigation]] to correct a [[dead reckoning]] track, that is, a course estimated from a vessel's position, course and speed. Using multiple methods helps the navigator detect errors, and simplifies procedures. When used this way, a navigator will from time to time measure the sun's altitude with a sextant, then compare that with a precalculated altitude based on the exact time and estimated position of the observation. On the chart, one will use the straight edge of a plotter to mark each position line. If the position line indicates a location more than a few miles from the estimated position, more observations can be taken to restart the dead-reckoning track.

In the event of equipment or electrical failure, taking sun lines a few times a day and advancing them by dead reckoning allows a vessel to get a crude running fix sufficient to return to port. One can also use the Moon, a planet, [[Polaris]], or one of 57 other [[navigational stars]] to track celestial positioning.

===Latitude===
[[Latitude]] was measured in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of [[Polaris]], the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which it is not in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the [[celestial north pole]]. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the [[zenith]], is not normally possible. When haze obscures the horizon, navigators use artificial horizons, which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.

===Longitude===
[[Longitude]] can be measured in the same way. If the angle to Polaris can be accurately measured, a similar measurement to a star near the eastern or western horizons will provide the longitude. The problem is that the Earth turns 15 degrees per hour, making such measurements dependent on time. A measure a few minutes before or after the same measure the day before creates serious navigation errors. Before good [[marine chronometer|chronometers]] were available, longitude measurements were based on the transit of the moon, or the positions of the moons of Jupiter. For the most part, these were too difficult to be used by anyone except professional astronomers. The invention of the modern chronometer by [[John Harrison]] in 1761 vastly simplified longitudinal calculation.

The longitude problem took centuries to solve and was dependent on the construction of a non-pendulum clock (as pendulum clocks cannot function accurately on a tilting ship, or indeed a moving vehicle of any kind). Two useful methods evolved during the 18th century and are still practised today: [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]], which does not involve the use of a chronometer, and use of an accurate timepiece or chronometer.

Presently, lay-person calculations of longitude can be made by noting the exact local time (leaving out any reference for Daylight Saving Time) when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.  The calculation of noon can be made more easily and accurately with a small, exactly vertical rod driven into level ground—take the time reading when the shadow is pointing due north (in the northern hemisphere).  Then take your local time reading and subtract it from GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]) or the time in London, England.  For example, a noon reading (1200 hours) near central Canada or the US would occur at approximately 6 pm (1800 hours) in London.  The six-hour differential is one quarter of a 24-hour day, or 90 degrees of a 360-degree circle (the Earth).  The calculation can also be made by taking the number of hours (use decimals for fractions of an hour) multiplied by 15, the number of degrees in one hour.  Either way, it can be demonstrated that much of central North America is at or near 90 degrees west longitude.  Eastern longitudes can be determined by adding the local time to GMT, with similar calculations.

====Lunar distance====
{{Main|lunar distance (navigation)|l1=Lunar distance}}
The older method, called "'''lunar distances'''", was refined in the 18th century and employed with decreasing regularity at sea through the middle of the 19th century. It is only used today by sextant hobbyists and historians, but the method is theoretically sound, and can be used when a timepiece is not available or its accuracy is suspect during a long sea voyage. The navigator precisely measures the angle between the moon and the sun, or between the moon and one of several stars near the [[ecliptic]]. The observed angle must be corrected for the effects of refraction and parallax, like any celestial sight. To make this correction the navigator would measure the altitudes of the moon and sun (or star) at about the same time as the lunar distance angle. Only rough values for the altitudes were required. Then a calculation with logarithms or graphical tables requiring ten to fifteen minutes' work would convert the observed angle to a geocentric lunar distance. The navigator would compare the corrected angle against those listed in the almanac for every three hours of Greenwich time, and interpolate between those values to get the actual Greenwich time aboard ship. Knowing Greenwich time and comparing against local time from a common altitude sight, the navigator can work out his longitude.

====Use of time====
{{Main|Marine chronometer#Today|l1= Marine chronometer Today}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The considerably more popular method was (and still is) to use an accurate timepiece to directly measure the time of a sextant sight. The need for accurate navigation led to the development of progressively more accurate chronometers in the 18th century (see [[John Harrison]]). Today, time is measured with a chronometer, a [[quartz clock|quartz watch]], a [[Time signal#Radio time signals|shortwave radio time signal]] broadcast from an [[atomic clock]], or the time displayed on a [[GPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|title=How accurate is the TIME DISPLAY on my GPS?|first=Joe|last=Mehaffey|date=|website=gpsinformation.net|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804120341/http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpstime.htm|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Watch#Electronic movements|quartz wristwatch]] normally keeps time within a half-second per day. If it is worn constantly, keeping it near body heat, its rate of drift can be measured with the radio and, by compensating for this drift, a navigator can keep time to better than a second per month. Traditionally, a navigator checked his chronometer from his sextant, at a geographic marker surveyed by a professional astronomer. This is now a rare skill, and most [[harbourmaster]]s cannot locate their harbour's marker.

Traditionally, three chronometers were kept in [[gimbals]] in a dry room near the centre of the ship. They were used to set a [[hack watch]] for the actual sight, so that no chronometers were ever exposed to the wind and salt water on deck. Winding and comparing the chronometers was a crucial duty of the navigator. Even today, it is still logged daily in the ship's deck log and reported to the Captain before [[Ship's bell|eight bells]] on the forenoon watch (shipboard noon). Navigators also set the ship's clocks and calendar.

==Modern celestial navigation==
The celestial line of position concept was discovered in 1837 by [[Thomas Hubbard Sumner]] when, after one observation, he computed and plotted his longitude at more than one trial latitude in his vicinity – and noticed that the positions lay along a line. Using this method with two bodies, navigators were finally able to cross two position lines and obtain their position – in effect determining both latitude and longitude. Later in the 19th century came the development of the modern (Marcq St. Hilaire) [[intercept method]]; with this method the body height and azimuth are calculated for a convenient trial position, and compared with the observed height. The difference in arcminutes is the nautical mile "intercept" distance that the position line needs to be shifted toward or away from the direction of the body's subpoint. (The intercept method uses the concept illustrated in the example in the “How it works” section above.) Two other methods of reducing sights are the [[longitude by chronometer]] and the [[ex-meridian]] method.

While celestial navigation is becoming increasingly redundant with the advent of inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers ([[GPS]]), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s, and [[marine navigation]] until quite recently. However; since a prudent mariner never relies on any sole means of fixing his position, many national maritime authorities still require deck officers to show knowledge of celestial navigation in examinations, primarily as a backup for electronic/satellite navigation. One of the most common current usages of celestial navigation aboard large merchant vessels is for compass calibration and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.

The [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[U.S. Navy]] continued instructing military aviators on celestial navigation use until 1997, because:
* celestial navigation can be used independently of ground aids
* celestial navigation has global coverage
* celestial navigation can not be jammed (although it can be obscured by clouds)
* celestial navigation does not give off any signals that could be detected by an enemy &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Air Force]] Pamphlet (AFPAM) 11-216, Chapters 8–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Naval Academy]] announced that it was discontinuing its course on celestial navigation (considered to be one of its most demanding non-engineering courses) from the formal curriculum in the spring of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EED61038F93AA15756C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fU%2fUnited%20States%20Naval%20Academy Navy Cadets Won't Discard Their Sextants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213125009/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EED61038F93AA15756C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FU%2FUnited%20States%20Naval%20Academy |date=2009-02-13 }}, [[The New York Times]] By DAVID W.

At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam to enter the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]]. It is also taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], most recently as Astronomy 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation – ''Astronomy 2 Celestial Navigation'' by Philip Sadler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121834/http://scholar.harvard.edu/psadler/classes/astronomy-2-celestial-navigation |date=2015-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial navigation continues to be used by private yachtsmen, and particularly by long-distance cruising yachts around the world. For small cruising boat crews, celestial navigation is generally considered an essential skill when venturing beyond visual range of land. Although GPS (Global Positioning System) technology is reliable, offshore yachtsmen use celestial navigation as either a primary navigational tool or as a backup.

Celestial navigation was used in commercial aviation up until the early part of the jet age; early [[Boeing 747]]s had a "sextant port" in the roof of the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=The future of flying|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=19 April 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614034443/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dbd7f5d4-e3ad-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html#slide0|archivedate=14 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only phased out in the 1960s with the advent of [[inertial navigation]] and doppler navigation systems, and today's satellite-based systems which can locate the aircraft's position accurate to a 3-meter sphere with several updates per second.

A variation on terrestrial celestial navigation was used to help orient the [[Apollo spacecraft]] en route to and from the Moon. To this day, space missions such as the [[Mars Exploration Rover#Cruise stage navigation components|Mars Exploration Rover]] use [[star tracker]]s to determine the [[Attitude control (spacecraft)|attitude]] of the spacecraft.

As early as the mid-1960s, advanced electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than {{convert|300|ft|m}}. The [[SR-71]] high-speed [[reconnaissance aircraft]] was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of [[Astro-inertial navigation system|automated celestial and inertial navigation]]. These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.

[[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s use celestial navigation to check and correct their course (initially set using internal gyroscopes) while flying outside the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. The immunity to jamming signals is the main driver behind this seemingly archaic technique.

[[X-ray pulsar-based navigation|X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing]] (XNAV) is an experimental navigation technique whereby the periodic [[X-ray]] signals emitted from [[X-ray pulsar|pulsars]] are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. Similar to GPS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to triangulate its position accurately (±5&amp;nbsp;km). The advantage of using X-ray signals over [[radio waves]] is that [[X-ray telescopes]] can be made smaller and lighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |title=Pulsars map the way for space missions |date=4 June 2014 |first=Tushna |last=Commissariat |publisher=[[Physics World]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018145025/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/jun/04/pulsars-map-the-way-for-space-missions |archivedate=18 October 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/515321/an-interplanetary-gps-using-pulsar-signals |title=An Interplanetary GPS Using Pulsar Signals|date=23 May 2013 |publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Werner |last2=Bernhardt |first2=Mike G. |last3=Jessner |first3=Axel |arxiv=1305.4842 |title=Autonomous Spacecraft Navigation With Pulsars |date=2013-05-21 |doi=10.2420/AF07.2013.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 2016 the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] launched an experimental pulsar navigation satellite called [[XPNAV 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |title=XPNAV 1 |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=2016-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101165228/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xpnav-1.htm |archivedate=2016-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|title=Chinese Long March 11 launches first Pulsar Navigation Satellite into Orbit|date=10 November 2016|publisher=Spaceflight101.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824052232/http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEXTANT (Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology) is a [[NASA]]-funded project developed at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] that is testing XNAV on-orbit on board the [[International Space Station]] in connection with the [[Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer|NICER]] project, launched on 3 June 2017 on the [[SpaceX CRS-11]] ISS resupply mission.&lt;ref name="nasa-nicer-manifest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |title=NICER Manifested on SpaceX-11 ISS Resupply Flight |series=NICER News |publisher=NASA |date=December 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2017 |quote=Previously scheduled for a December 2016 launch on SpaceX-12, NICER will now fly to the International Space Station with two other payloads on SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-11, in the Dragon vehicle's unpressurized Trunk. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324025933/https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial navigation trainer==
Celestial navigation trainers for aircraft crews combine a simple [[flight simulator]] with a [[planetarium]].

An early example is the [[Link Trainer|Link Celestial Navigation Trainer]], used in the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II|work=A Brief History of Aircraft Flight Simulation|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209093839/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bleep/SimHist4.html|archivedate=December 9, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporal Tomisita "Tommye" Flemming-Kelly-U.S.M.C.-Celestial Navigation Trainer −1943/45|work=World War II Memories|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|accessdate=January 27, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119104703/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/9601/kelly.html|archivedate=2005-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in a {{convert|45|ft|m}} high building, it featured a [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] accommodating a whole [[bomber]] crew (pilot, navigator and bombardier). The cockpit offered a full array of [[measuring instrument|instruments]] which the [[aviator|pilot]] used to fly the simulated aeroplane. Fixed to a [[Astrodome (aviation)|dome]] above the cockpit was an arrangement of lights, some [[collimated]], simulating [[constellation]]s from which the navigator determined the plane's position. The dome's movement simulated the changing positions of the stars with the passage of time and the movement of the plane around the earth. The navigator also received simulated radio signals from various positions on the ground. Below the cockpit moved "terrain plates" – large, movable aerial photographs of the land below – which gave the crew the impression of flight and enabled the bomber to practise lining up bombing targets. A team of operators sat at a control booth on the ground below the machine, from which they could simulate [[weather]] conditions such as wind or cloud. This team also tracked the aeroplane's position by moving a "crab" (a marker) on a paper map.

The Link Celestial Navigation Trainer was developed in response to a request made by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1939. The RAF ordered 60 of these machines, and the first one was built in 1941. The RAF used only a few of these, leasing the rest back to the US, where eventually hundreds were in use.

A '''compass rose''', sometimes called a '''windrose''' or '''Rose of the Winds''', is a figure on a [[compass]], [[map]], [[nautical chart]], or monument used to display the orientation of the [[cardinal direction]]s ([[north]], [[east]], [[south]], and [[west]]) and their intermediate points. It is also the term for the graduated markings found on the traditional [[magnetic compass]]. Today, the idea of a compass rose is found on, or featured in, almost all [[navigation]] systems, including [[nautical chart]]s, [[non-directional beacon]]s (NDB), [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) systems, global-positioning systems ([[GPS]]), and similar equipment.

[[File:Windrose.svg|thumb|right|Compass rose with the eight [[principal winds]]]]
The modern compass rose has eight [[principal winds]]. Listed clockwise, these are:

|}

Although modern compasses use the names of the eight principal directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc.), older compasses use the traditional Italianate wind names of Medieval origin (Tramontana, Greco, Levante, etc.)

4-point compass roses use only the four "basic winds" or "[[cardinal directions]]" (North, East, South, West), with angles of difference at 90°.

8-point compass roses use the eight [[principal winds]]—that is, the four cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) plus the four "intercardinal" or "[[ordinal directions]]" (NE, SE, SW, NW), at angles of difference of 45°.

16-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting the angles of the principal winds to come up with intermediate compass points, known as [[half-wind]]s, at angles of difference of 22{{frac|1|2}}°. The names of the half-winds are simply combinations of the principal winds to either side, principal then ordinal.  E.g. North-northeast (NNE), East-northeast (ENE), etc.

32-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting these angles, and coming up with [[quarter-wind]]s at 11{{frac|1|4}}° angles of difference. Quarter-wind names are constructed with the names "X by Y", which can be read as "one quarter wind from X toward Y", where X is one of the eight principal winds and Y is one of the two adjacent cardinal directions. For example, North-by-east (NbE) is one quarter wind from North towards East, Northeast-by-north (NEbN) is one quarter wind from Northeast toward North. Naming all 32 points on the rose is called "[[boxing the compass]]".

The 32-point rose has the uncomfortable number of 11{{frac|1|4}}° between points, but is easily found by halving divisions and may have been easier for those not using a 360° circle.

== History ==

Linguistic anthropological studies have shown that most human communities have four points of [[cardinal direction]]. The names given to these directions are usually derived from either locally-specific geographic features (e.g. "towards the hills", "towards the sea") or from celestial bodies (especially the sun) or from atmospheric features (winds, temperature).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C.H. (1983) "Where do Cardinal Direction Terms Come From?", Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 25 (2), p. 121-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Most mobile populations tend to adopt sunrise and sunset for East and West and the direction from where different winds blow to denote North and South.

=== Classical compass rose ===

{{main|Classical compass winds}}

The [[ancient Greek]]s originally maintained distinct and separate systems of points and winds. The four Greek [[cardinal direction|cardinal points]] (arctos, anatole, mesembria and dusis) were based on celestial bodies and used for orientation. The four Greek [[anemoi|winds]] (Boreas, Notos, Eurus, Zephyrus) were confined to [[meteorology]]. Nonetheless, both systems were gradually conflated, and wind names came to eventually denote cardinal directions as well.&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac, M.A.P. (1874) ''Aperçus historiques sur la rose des vents: lettre à Monsieur Henri Narducci.'' Rome: Civelli&lt;/ref&gt;

In his meteorological studies, [[Aristotle]] identified ten distinct winds: two north-south winds (Aparctias, Notos) and four sets of east-west winds blowing from different latitudes—the [[Arctic circle]] (Meses, Thrascias), the [[summer solstice]] horizon (Caecias, Argestes), the [[equinox]] (Apeliotes, Zephyrus) and the [[winter solstice]] (Eurus, Lips). However, Aristotle's system was asymmetric. To restore balance, [[Timosthenes]] of Rhodes added two more winds to produce the classical 12-wind rose, and began using the winds to denote geographical direction in navigation. [[Eratosthenes]] deducted two winds from Aristotle's system, to produce the classical 8-wind rose.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (e.g. [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) adopted the Greek 12-wind system, and replaced its names with [[Latin language|Latin]] equivalents, e.g. Septentrio, Subsolanus, Auster, Favonius, etc. Uniquely, [[Vitruvius]] came up with a 24-wind rose.

According to the chronicler [[Einhard]] (c. 830), the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] himself came up with his own names for the classical 12 winds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Einhard]], ''Vita Karoli Imp.'', [Lat: (Eng.([https://books.google.com/books?id=R2IJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.22])([https://books.google.com/books?id=2mMNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.68])&lt;/ref&gt; He named the four cardinal winds on the roots ''Nord'' (etymology uncertain, could be "wet", meaning from the rainy lands), ''Ost'' (shining place, sunrise), ''Sund'' (sunny lands) and ''Vuest'' (dwelling place, meaning evening). Intermediate winds were constructed as simple compound names of these four (e.g. "Nordostdroni", the "northeasterly" wind). These Carolingian names are the source of the modern compass point names found in nearly all modern west European languages. (e.g. North, East, South and West in English; Nord, Est, Sud, Ouest in [[French language|French]], etc.)

The following table gives a rough equivalence of the classical 12-wind rose with the modern compass directions (Note: the directions are imprecise since it is not clear at what angles the classical winds are supposed to be with each other; some have argued that they should be equally spaced at 30 degrees each; for more details, see the article on [[Classical compass winds]]).

=== Sidereal compass rose ===

The "sidereal" compass rose demarcates the compass points by the position of [[star]]s in the night sky, rather than winds. [[Arab]] navigators in the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]], who depended on [[celestial navigation]], were using a 32-point sidereal compass rose before the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Saussure, L. de (1923) "L'origine de la rose des vents et l'invention de la boussole", ''Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles'', vol. 5, no.2 &amp; 3, pp.149-81 and 259-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E.G.R.

Lagan (2005) ''The Barefoot Navigator: Navigating with the skills of the ancients''. Dobbs Ferry, New York: Sheridan House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern hemisphere, the steady Pole Star ([[Polaris]]) was used for the N-S axis; the less-steady [[Southern Cross]] had to do for the southern hemisphere, as the southern pole star, [[Sigma Octantis]], is too dim to be easily seen from Earth with the naked eye. The other thirty points on the sidereal rose were determined by the rising and setting positions of fifteen bright stars. Reading from North to South, in their rising and setting positions, these are:&lt;ref&gt;List comes from Tolmacheva (1980:p.183), based "with some reservations" on Tibbets (1971: p.296, n.133).

The western half of the rose would be the same stars in their setting position. The true position of these stars is only approximate to their theoretical equidistant rhumbs on the sidereal compass. Stars with the same [[declination]] formed a "linear constellation" or ''kavenga'' to provide direction as the night progressed.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Halpern (1985) [http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Halpern-MA1985.pdf The Origins of the Carolinian Sidereal Compass], Master's thesis, [[Texas A &amp; M University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar sidereal compass was used by [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian and Micronesian navigators]] in the Pacific Ocean, although different stars were used in a number of cases, clustering around the East-West axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=W.

=== Mariner's compass rose ===

In Europe, the Classical 12-wind system continued to be taught in academic settings during the Medieval era, but seafarers in the Mediterranean came up with their own distinct 8-wind system. The mariners used names derived from the [[Mediterranean lingua franca]]—the [[Italian language|Italian]]-tinged patois among Medieval sailors, composed principally of [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]], mixed with [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] terms from around the Mediterranean basin. [[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|400px|32-wind compass with traditional names (and traditional color code)]]
* (N) Tramontana
* (NE) Greco (or Bora)
* (E) Levante
* (SE) Scirocco (or Exaloc)
* (S) Ostro (or Mezzogiorno)
* (SW) Libeccio (or Garbino)
* (W) Ponente
* (NW) Maestro (or Mistral)

The exact origin of the mariner's eight-wind rose is obscure. Only two of its point names (''Ostro'', ''Libeccio'') have Classical etymologies, the rest of the names seem to be autonomously derived. Two [[Arabic]] words stand out: ''Scirocco'' (SE) from ''al-Sharq'' (الشرق – east in Arabic) and the variant ''Garbino'' (SW), from ''al-Gharb'' (الغرب – west in Arabic). This suggests the mariner's rose was probably acquired by southern Italian seafarers not from their classical Roman ancestors, but rather from [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] in the 11th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E.G. R. (1937) "The 'De Ventis' of Matthew Paris", ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; The coasts of the [[Maghreb]] and [[Mashriq]] are SW and SE of Sicily respectively; the ''Greco'' (a NE wind), reflects the position of Byzantine-held Calabria-Apulia to the northeast of Arab Sicily, while the ''Maestro'' (a NW wind) is a reference to the [[Mistral wind]] that blows from the southern French coast towards northwest Sicily.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The 32-point compass used for navigation in the Mediterranean by the 14th century, had increments of 11{{frac|1|4}}° between points. Only the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) were given special names. The eight [[half-wind]]s just combined the names of the two principal winds, e.g. Greco-Tramontana for NNE, Greco-Levante for ENE, and so on. [[Quarter-wind]]s were more cumbersomely phrased, with the closest principal wind named first and the next-closest principal wind second, e.g. "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco" (literally, "one quarter wind from North towards Northeast", i.e. North by East), and "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana" ("one quarter wind from NE towards N", i.e. Northeast by North). [[Boxing the compass]] (naming all 32 winds) was expected of all Medieval mariners.

=== Depiction on Nautical Charts ===

In the earliest Medieval [[portolan chart]]s of the 14th century, compass roses were depicted as mere collections of color-coded compass [[rhumb lines]]: black for the eight main winds, green for the eight half-winds and red for the sixteen quarter-winds.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, H.M. and J.H. Robinson, editors (1987) ''Cartographical Innovations: An international handbook of mapping terms to 1900''. London: Map Collector Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The average portolan chart had sixteen such roses (or confluence of lines), spaced out equally around the circumference of a large implicit circle.

The cartographer [[Cresques Abraham]] of [[Majorca]], in his [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375, was the first to draw an ornate compass rose on a map. By the end of the 15th century, Portuguese cartographers began drawing multiple ornate compass roses throughout the chart, one upon each of the sixteen circumference roses (unless the illustration conflicted with coastal details).&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Nordenskiöld (1896) "Résumé of an Essay on the Early History of Charts and Sailing Directions", ''Report of the Sixth International Geographical Congress: held in London, 1895''. London: J. Murray. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=glw5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA693#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.693])&lt;/ref&gt;

The points on a compass rose were frequently labeled by the initial letters of the mariner's principal winds (T, G, L, S, O, L, P, M). However, from the outset, the custom also began to distinguish the north from the other points by a specific visual marker. Medieval Italian cartographers typically used a simple arrowhead or circumflex-hatted T (an allusion to the compass needle) to designate the north, while the [[Majorcan cartographic school]] typically used a stylized [[Pole Star]] for its north mark.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Heinrich (1947) "On the Real and the Pseudo-Pilestrina Maps and Other Early Portuguese Maps in Munich", ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 4, p. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the [[fleur-de-lis]] as north mark was introduced by [[Pedro Reinel]], and quickly became customary in compass roses (and is still often used today). Old compass roses also often used a [[Christian cross]] at Levante (E), indicating the direction of [[Jerusalem]] from the point of view of the Mediterranean sea.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;Dan Reboussin (2005). [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/cm/africana/windrose.htm Wind Rose.] [[University of Florida]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelve Classical winds (or a subset of them) were also sometimes depicted on portolan charts, albeit not on a compass rose, but rather separately on small disks or coins on the edges of the map.

The compass rose was also depicted on [[traverse board]]s used on board ships to record headings sailed at set time intervals.

The contemporary compass rose appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes '''true''' [[cardinal direction]]s while the smaller inside ring denotes '''magnetic''' cardinal directions. '''[[True north]]''' refers to the geographical location of the [[north pole]] while '''[[magnetic north]]''' refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a [[compass]]) will point. The angular difference between '''true''' and '''magnetic''' north is called [[magnetic variation|variation]], which varies depending on location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRqzoX04v5AC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=compass+variation+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RQOP6i4YkC&amp;sig=7wi8b-sx9EAESaeQC55aNInCA6c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_88VTtLIDqHb0QHvsrkv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=compass%20variation%20book&amp;f=false|title=The Annapolis book of seamanship|author=John Rousmaniere, Mark Smith|page=233|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-684-85420-5|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is called [[magnetic deviation|deviation]] which varies by vessel and its heading.

The '''cottage garden''' is a distinct style that uses informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. English in origin, it depends on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure. Homely and functional [[garden]]s connected to working-class cottages go back centuries, but their stylized reinvention occurred  in 1870s England, as a reaction to the more structured, rigorously maintained estate gardens with their formal designs and mass plantings of greenhouse annuals.

The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than today's, with emphasis on vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as [[Primula vulgaris|primroses]] and [[violet (plant)|violet]]s, along with flowers with household use such as [[calendula]] and various [[herb]]s. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned [[rose]]s that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like [[Bellis perennis|daisies]]. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.

Modern cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or [[native plant]]s not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, continue to be a cottage-garden mainstay—along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.

===Origins===

Cottage gardens, which emerged in Elizabethan times, appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins &amp; Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=1-84340-216-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.&lt;ref name="Scott-James80"/&gt; According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. [[Helen Leach]] analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental [[potager]] and the [[herb garden]]. She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of [[John Claudius Loudon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Helen|title=Cultivating Myths: Fiction, Fact and Fashion in Garden History|publisher=Auckland: [[Godwit (publisher)|Godwit]]|year=2000|isbn=1-86962-049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loudon helped to design the estate at [[Great Tew]], [[Oxfordshire]], where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a smallholding or large garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.&lt;ref&gt;''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008

Authentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty.&lt;ref name="Scott-James80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&amp;pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[sweet william]] and [[hollyhock]]s were grown entirely for their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6–9|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The "naturalness" of informal design began to be noticed and developed by the British leisured class. [[Alexander Pope]] was an early proponent of less formal gardens, calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the "amiable simplicity of unadorned nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Myra|title=The Treatment of Nature in English Poetry Between Pope and Wordsworth|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1896|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAE7uOjMdDYC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal, and more natural, gardens included [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Lord Shaftesbury]]. The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of ''The Cottage Gardener'' (1848–61), edited by [[George William Johnson (writer)|George William Johnson]], where the emphasis is squarely on the "florist's flowers", [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnation]]s and [[Primula auricula|auricula]]s in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue-collar hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Jim|date=Spring 1988|title=The Lichfield Florists|journal=Garden History|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17–23|doi=10.2307/1586902|jstor=1586902|publisher=Garden History, Vol. 16, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jekyll Manor House Border.jpg|thumb|Restored [[Gertrude Jekyll]] border at Manor House, Upton Grey, Hampshire]]
[[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] helped to popularise less formal gardens in their many books and magazine articles. Robinson's ''The Wild Garden'', published in 1870, contained in the first edition an essay on "The Garden of British Wild Flowers", which was eliminated from later editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Massingham|first=Betty|title=William Robinson: A Portrait|journal=Garden History|publisher=The Garden History Society|volume= 6 | issue = 1|pages=61–85|doi=10.2307/1586557|jstor=1586557|year=1978}} p. 63f.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''The English Flower Garden'', illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset, Kent and Surrey, he remarked, "One lesson of these little gardens, that are so pretty, is that one can get good effects from simple materials."&lt;ref&gt;Massingham, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses. Her ''Colour in the Flower Garden'' (1908) is still in print today.

Robinson and Jekyll were part of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], a broader movement in art, architecture, and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendle|first=Tony|author2=Stephen Forbes|title=Urban Nature Conservation: Landscape Management in the Urban Countryside|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=1997|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KskkCkr6t2MC&amp;pg=PA79|isbn=978-0-419-19300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horwood|first=Catherine|title=Potted History: The Story of Plants in the Home|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=2008|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6ceoBeBo2AC&amp;pg=PA151|isbn=978-0-7112-2800-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kammen|first=Carol|author2=Norma Prendergast|title=Encyclopedia of Local History|publisher=Rowman Altamira|year=2000|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nf_M9vqUMLYC&amp;pg=PA205|isbn=978-0-7425-0399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were influenced by [[William Morris]], one of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement—Robinson quoted Morris's views condemning [[carpet bedding]]; Jekyll shared Morris's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Jill |author2=Penny Hart |author3=John Simmons |title=The Gardens of William Morris|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=1998|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlpJYel38hkC&amp;pg=PA87|isbn=978-0-7112-1370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Morris built his Red House in Kent, it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardening—the "old-fashioned" garden suddenly became a fashion accessory among the British artistic middle class, and the cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Virginia Tuttle|title=The Once and Future Gardener: Garden Writing from the Golden Age of Magazines, 1900–1940|publisher=David R.

[[File:The Clothes Basket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helen Allingham]] [[watercolor]] showing elite [[peony|peonies]] and modern [[delphinium]]s in an idealised cottage garden, 1909]]
In the early 20th century the term "cottage garden" might be applied even to as large and sophisticated a garden as [[Hidcote Manor]], which [[Vita Sackville-West]] described as "a cottage garden on the most glorified scale"&lt;ref name="Vita"&gt;Vita Sackville-West, "Hidcote Manor", ''Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society'' '''74''' (1949:476-81), as noted by Brent Elliott in "Historical Revivalism in the Twentieth Century: A Brief Introduction" ''Garden History'' '''28'''.1, Reviewing the Twentieth-Century Landscape (Summer 2000:17–31)&lt;/ref&gt; but where the colour harmonies were carefully contrived and controlled, as in the famous "Red Borders". Sackville-West had taken similar models for her own "cottage garden", one of many "garden rooms" at [[Sissinghurst Castle Garden|Sissinghurst Castle]]—her idea of a cottage garden was a place where "the plants grow in a jumble, flowering shrubs mingled with Roses,&lt;!--Roses in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "old roses" Vita Sackville-West was rediscovering were introduced from French growers in the 1830s and 1840s. See [[Graham Stuart Thomas]], ''The Old Shrub Roses''.&lt;/ref&gt; herbaceous plants with bulbous subjects, climbers scrambling over hedges, seedlings coming up wherever they have chosen to sow themselves".&lt;ref name="Vita"/&gt; The cottage garden ideal was also spread by artists such as water-colourist [[Helen Allingham]] (1848–1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=John Dixon|author2=Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn|title=The Vernacular Garden: Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium on the History of Landscape Architecture XIV|publisher=[[Dumbarton Oaks]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-88402-201-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVLU-_6KcSoC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence was [[Margery Fish]] (1892–1969), whose garden survives at [[East Lambrook Manor]].&lt;ref name="ODNB_entry"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48830 ODNB entry for Margery Fish by Catherine Horwood] Retrieved 1 December 2012.

The cottage garden in France is a development of the early 20th century. [[Monet]]'s garden at [[Giverny]] is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lee Anne|title=Exploring Garden Style: Creative Ideas from America's Best Gardeners|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA95|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
While the classic cottage garden is built around a [[cottage]], many cottage-style gardens are created around houses and even estates such as [[Hidcote Manor]], with its more intimate "garden rooms".&lt;ref&gt;

In spite of their appearances, cottage gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm. Due to space limitations, they are often in small rectangular plots, with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences. The plants, layout, and materials are chosen to give the impression of casualness and a country feel.&lt;ref name="RHS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robin|title=The Garden Designer|editor=Royal Horticultural Society|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=1995|page=190|isbn=978-0-7112-0812-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkNrAeE5p7sC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cottage gardens frequently use local flowers and materials, rather than those of the traditional cottage garden.

The cottage garden is designed to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves, or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can go right up to the house, lawns are replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The overall appearance can be of "a vegetable garden that has been taken over by flowers."&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt; The method of planting closely packed plants was supposed to reduce the amount of weeding and watering required, but planted stone pathways or turf paths, and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, are cottage garden features requiring well-timed maintenance.

===Materials===
Paths, arbors, and fences use traditional or antique looking materials. Wooden fences and gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=1999|page=6|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen to give the impression of an old-fashioned country garden.&lt;ref name="RHS"/&gt;

==Plants==
===Overview===
Until the late 19th century, cottage gardens mainly grew vegetables for household consumption. Typically half the garden would be used for cultivating [[potato]]es and half for a mix of other vegetables. [[John Claudius Loudon]] wrote extensively on cottage gardens in his book ''An Encyclopædia of Gardening'' (1822) and in ''Gardener's Magazine'' from 1826. In 1838 he wrote "I seldom observe any thing in a cottage garden but potatoes, cabbages, beans, and French beans; in a few instances onions and [[parsneps]], and very seldom a few peas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Directive Hints for the effective Cultivation of Cottage Gardens|journal=Gardener's Magazine|page=648|year=1832|issue=December|publisher=J.C. LOUDON}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1865 issue of ''The Farmer's Magazine'' noted that in "[[Ireland]] and much of the [[Highlands of Scotland]], potatoes are the only thing grown in the cottage-garden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cottage Cookery|journal=The Farmer's Magazine|year=1865|volume=27|page=145|publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cottage garden plants are typically flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use [[heirloom gardening|heirloom]] or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these may not have been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants.&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"/&gt; In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by [[David C.H. Austin|David Austin]] have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee Anne White|first=Lee Anne White|title=Exploring Garden Style|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=106|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lee Anne|title=Exploring Garden Style: Creative Ideas from America's Best Gardeners|publisher=Taunton Press|year=2001|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSBJIpzex5kC&amp;pg=PA92|isbn=978-1-56158-474-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roses===
[[File:Rosa 'Climbing Souvenir de la Malmaison'.JPG|thumb|left|A climbing sport of the elite [[Rosa 'Souvenir de la Malmaison'|'Souvenir de la Malmaison']], introduced before 1893, typical of a modern cottage garden.]]

Cottage gardens are always associated with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, in contrast to the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of ''[[Rosa gallica]]'', which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4&amp;nbsp;ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (''R. gallica'' 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the [[Damask rose]], which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA131|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provence rose]] or ''Rosa centifolia'' is the full and fat "cabbage rose" made famous by Dutch masters in their 17th-century paintings. These very fragrant shrub roses grow 5&amp;nbsp;ft tall and wide, with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar. The centifolia roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites, including varieties of moss rose (roses with attractive 'mossy' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds). Unlike most modern hybrids, the older roses bloom on the previous year's wood, so they aren't pruned back severely each year. Also as they don't bloom continuously, they can share their branches with later-flowering climbers such as [[Clematis]] vines, which use the rose branches for support. A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses, with bare earth or mulch underneath', but is casually blended with other flowers, vines, and groundcover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=132–133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA132|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of China roses (derived from ''[[Rosa chinensis]]'') late in the 18th century, many hybrids were introduced that had the [[Remontancy|remontant]] (repeat-blooming) nature of the China roses, but maintained the informal old rose shape and flower. These included the [[Rose#Bourbon|Bourbon rose]] and the [[Rose#Noisette|Noisette rose]], which were added to the rose repertoire of the cottage garden, and, more recently, hybrid "English" roses introduced by [[David C.H. Austin|David Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulman|first=Andrew|author2=Jacqueline Koch|title=The Northwest Cottage Garden|publisher=Sasquatch Books|year=2004|pages=134–138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFdx1bzf_YC&amp;pg=PA134|isbn=978-1-57061-363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing plants===
[[File:Clematis vitalba.JPG|thumb|''[[Clematis vitalba]]'']]
Many of the old roses had cultivars that grew very long canes, which could be tied to trellises or against walls. These older varieties are called "ramblers", rather than "climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beutler|first=Linda|title=Gardening with Clematis|publisher=Timber Press|year=2004|page=88|isbn=978-0-88192-644-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZutMXEKLhoC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included [[European honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera periclymenum'') and [[Clematis vitalba|Traveller's Joy]] (''Clematis vitalba''). The modern cottage garden includes many [[Clematis]] hybrids that have the old appeal, with sparse foliage that allows them to grow through roses and trees, and along fences and arbors.&lt;ref name="Philips18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Sue|title=Cottage Garden Flowers|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2003|page=18|isbn=978-1-84403-065-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjmCVlPyJQC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many Clematis species used in the modern cottage garden, including ''Clematis armandii'', ''Clematis chrysocoma'', and ''[[Clematis flammula]]''. Popular honeysuckles for cottage gardens include [[Japanese honeysuckle]] and ''Lonicera tragophylla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=David|author2=Alan Bridgewater|others=Gill Bridgewater|title=The Climbing Plants Specialist|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2006|page=55|isbn=978-1-84537-105-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK4zaP32tlgC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hedging plants===
In the traditional cottage garden, hedges served as fences on the perimeter to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. [[Crataegus monogyna|Hawthorn]] leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing [[Elderberry]], in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. [[Holly]] was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. [[Privet]] was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including [[Laurel family|laurel]], [[lilac]], [[snowberry]], [[Chaenomeles|japonica]], and others.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Valerie|title=Yesterday's Countryside|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=2006|pages=47–48|isbn=978-0-7153-2196-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IF-VCcxGY0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flowers and herbs===
[[File:Single lavendar flower02.jpg|thumb|left|Lavender]]
Popular flowers in the traditional cottage garden included florist's flowers which were grown by enthusiasts—such as violets, pinks, and primroses&lt;ref name="Philips18"/&gt;—and those grown with a more practical purpose. For example, the [[Calendula officinalis|calendula]], grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers, was primarily valued for eating, for adding color to butter and cheese, for adding smoothness to soups and stews, and for all kinds of healing salves and preparations. Like many old cottage garden [[Annual plant|annual]]s and herbs, it freely self-sowed, making it easier to grow and share.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Jo Ann|author2=Holly S. Dougherty|title=Herbs in Bloom|publisher=Timber Press|page=109|year=2005|isbn=978-0-88192-698-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idS5JjtHCKAC&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular cottage garden annuals included [[Viola (plant)|violets]], [[pansy|pansies]], [[Matthiola|stocks]], and [[Mignonette (Reseda)|mignonette]].&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"&gt;Scott-James, ''The Pleasure Garden'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Perennial plant|Perennial]]s were the largest group of traditional cottage garden flowers&lt;ref name="Philips18"/&gt;—those with a long cottage garden history include [[hollyhocks]], [[carnations]], [[sweet william]]s, [[Leucanthemum vulgare|marguerites]], [[Calendula|marigolds]], [[Lilium|lilies]], [[peony|peonies]], [[tulip]]s, [[crocus]], [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], [[foxglove]], [[monkshood]], [[lavender]], [[campanulas]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Oenothera|evening primrose]], [[lily-of-the-valley]], [[Primulaceae|primrose]], [[Primula veris|cowslips]], and many varieties of [[rose]]s.&lt;ref name="Scott-James37"/&gt; 

Today herbs are typically thought of as culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they were considered to be any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Sue|title=Cottage Garden Flowers|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2003|page=17|isbn=978-1-84403-065-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjmCVlPyJQC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional cottage garden herbs included [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[thyme]], [[southernwood]], [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[catmint]], [[feverfew]], [[lungwort]], [[soapwort]], [[hyssop]], [[sweet woodruff]], and lavender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Sarah|title=The Herb Garden|publisher=Frances Lincoln Publishers|year=2003|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ky-WVGIqkWAC&amp;pg=PA52|isbn=978-0-7112-2057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Jo Ann|author2=Holly S.

===Fruits===
Fruit in the traditional cottage garden would have included an [[apple]] and a [[pear]], for [[cider]] and [[perry]],&lt;ref&gt;The raw fruits, considered indigestible, were not much eaten before the twentieth century.&lt;/ref&gt; gooseberries and raspberries.

'''Depth sounding''' refers to the act of measuring depth. It is often referred to simply as '''sounding'''. Data taken from soundings are used in [[bathymetry]] to make maps of the floor of a body of water, and were traditionally shown on [[nautical chart]]s in [[fathoms]] and feet.  The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the agency responsible for bathymetric data in the United States, still uses fathoms and feet on nautical charts. In other countries, the [[International System of Units]] (metres) has become the standard for measuring depth.&lt;ref&gt;

==Terminology==
"Sounding" derives from the [[Old English]] ''sund'', meaning swimming, water, sea; it is not related to the word [[sound]] in the sense of noise or tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=1969 |edition=Second |chapter=Sound, v{{small|{{sup|2}}}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to [[Sound (geography)|sound]], a geographical term.

Traditional terms for soundings are a source for common expressions in the English language, notably "deep six" (a sounding of 6 fathoms): see John Ehrlichman.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1850s, the leadsmen also used old-fashioned words for some of the numbers; for example instead of "two" they would say "twain".  Thus when the depth was two fathoms, they would call "by the mark twain!".  The American writer [[Mark Twain]], a former river [[pilot (harbour)|pilot]], likely took his [[pen name]] from this cry. The term lives on in today's world in [[echo sounding]], the technique of using [[sonar]] to measure depth.&lt;ref name="Hohlfelder" /&gt;

==History==
==={{Anchor|Sounding Line}}Lead and line===

[[File:Mesure du fond avec la sonde sur une frégate-Morel Fatio-img 3163.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Lead and line sounding]]

A ''sounding line'' or ''lead line'' is a length of thin [[rope]] with a [[Plumb-bob|plummet]], generally of [[lead]], at its end.  Regardless of the actual composition of the plummet, it is still called a "lead". Leads were swung, or cast, by a leadsman, usually standing in the [[Chains (nautical)|chains]] of a ship, up against the [[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]].&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Kemp |editor-first=P. |title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1976 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the depth of water by lead and line dates back to ancient civilization. It continues in widespread use today in recreational boating and as a backup to electronic [[echo sounding]] devices which are prone to failure and inaccuracy. [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] navigators are known to have used sounding leads, some of which have been uncovered by archaeologists. Sounding by lead and line continued throughout the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods and is still commonly used today. The [[Bible]] describes lead and line sounding in Acts, whilst the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] documents the use of a sounding lead during [[William the Conqueror]]'s 1066 landing in [[Normandy]]. Lead and line sounding operates alongside sounding poles, and/or [[echo sounding]] devices particularly when navigating in shallower waters and on rivers.&lt;ref name="Hohlfelder"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Hohlfelder |editor-first=R. |title=The Maritime World of Ancient Rome | chapter=Testing the Waters: The Role of Sounding-Weights in Ancient Mediterranean Navigation | location=Ann Arbor |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |year=2008 |pages=119–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sounding leads.jpg|thumb|left|Sounding leads]]
At sea, in order to avoid repeatedly hauling in and measuring the wet line by stretching it out with one's arms, it is common practice to tie marks at intervals along the line.  These marks are made of [[leather]], [[Calico (fabric)|calico]], [[serge (fabric)|serge]] and other materials, and so shaped and attached that it is possible to "read" them by eye during the day or by feel at night.  Traditionally the marks were at every second or third fathom: at 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 20 fathoms.  The "leadsman" called out the depth as he read it off the line. If the depth was at a mark he would call "by the mark" followed by the number, while if it was between two marks, he would call "by the deep" followed by the estimated number; thus "by the mark five," since there is a five-fathom mark, but "by the deep six," since there is no six-fathom mark.&lt;ref name="Hohlfelder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Charles |title=A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary: Containing an Explanation of the Terms, and an Account of the Several Subjects Comprized under the Heads Mathematics, Astronomy, and Philosophy both Natural and Experimental (Volume 2) |year=1795 |pages=474-475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fractions would be called out by preceding the number with the phrases "and a half," "and a quarter," or "a quarter less"; thus 4 3/4 fathoms would be called as "a quarter less five," 3 1/2 as "and a half three," and so on.&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt;

Soundings may also be taken to establish the ship's position as an aid in [[navigation]], not merely for safety.  Soundings of this type were usually taken using leads that had a wad of [[tallow]] in a concavity at the bottom of the plummet.  The tallow would bring up part of the bottom sediment (sand, pebbles, clay, shells) and allow the ship's officers to better estimate their position by providing information useful for [[pilotage]] and [[anchor]]ing. If the plummet came up clean, it meant the bottom was rock.  Nautical charts provide information about the seabed materials at particular locations.&lt;ref name="Hohlfelder" /&gt;  Nautical charts also include depth contour lines.  It is thus sometimes possible to navigate in poor visibility by noting which contour line one is closest to.

===Mechanisation===
[[File:PSM V03 D273 Massey sounding machine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Edward Massey's sounding machine]]

During the nineteenth century, a number of attempts were made to mechanise depth sounding. Designs ranged from complex brass machines to relatively simple pulley systems. Navies around the world, particularly the [[Royal Navy]] in Britain, were concerned about the reliability of lead and line sounding. The introduction of new machines was understood as a way to introduce standardised practices for sounding in a period in which naval discipline was of great concern.&lt;ref name="Poskett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poskett |first=J | date=2015 |title=Sounding in silence: men, machines and the changing environment of naval discipline, 1796-1815 (free PDF available online)| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007087414000934 |journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=213–232 |doi=10.1017/S0007087414000934 |access-date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most widely adopted sounding machines was developed in 1802 by Edward Massey, a clockmaker from [[Staffordshire]]. The machine was designed to be fixed to a sounding lead and line. It featured a rotor which turned a dial as the lead sank to the sea floor. On striking the sea floor, the rotor would lock. Massey’s sounding machine could then be hauled in and the depth could be read off the dials in fathoms. By 1811, the Royal Navy had purchased 1,750 of these devices: one for every ship in commission during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="McConnell"&gt;{{cite book |last=McConnell |first=A |date=1982 |title=No Sea Too Deep: The History of Oceanographic Instruments |location=Bristol |publisher=Hilger |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Board of Longitude]] was instrumental in convincing the Royal Navy to adopt Massey's machine.&lt;ref name="Poskett" /&gt;

Massey’s was not the only sounding machine adopted during the nineteenth century. The Royal Navy also purchased a number of Peter Burt’s buoy and nipper device. This machine was quite different from Massey’s. It consisted of an inflatable canvas bag (the [[buoy]]) and a spring-loaded wooden pulley block (the nipper). Again, the device was designed to operate alongside a lead and line. In this case, the buoy would be pulled behind the ship and the line threaded through the pulley. The lead could then be released. The buoy ensured that the lead fell perpendicular to the sea floor even when the ship was moving. The spring-loaded pulley would then catch the rope when the lead hit the sea bed, ensuring an accurate reading of the depth.&lt;ref name="Poskett" /&gt;

Both Massey and Burt’s machines were designed to operate in relatively shallow waters (up to 150 fathoms). With the growth of seabed telegraphy in the later nineteenth century, new machines were introduced to measure much greater depths of water. The most widely adopted deep-sea sounding machine in the nineteenth century was Kelvin’s sounding machine, designed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) and patented in 1876. This operated on the same principle as lead and line sounding. In this case, the line consisted of a drum of piano wire whilst the lead was of a much greater weight. Later versions of Kelvin’s machine also featured a motorised drum in order to facilitate the winding and unwinding of the line. These devices also featured a dial which recorded the length of line let out.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dunn | first1=R | editor1-last=Dunn |editor1-first=R |editor2-last=Leggett |editor2-first=D | title=Re-inventing the Ship: Science, Technology and the Maritime World, 1800-1918 | chapter=‘Their brains over-taxed’: Ships, Instruments and Users | location=Farnham |publisher=[[Ashgate]] | year=2012 |pages=131–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Echo sounding===
Both lead-and-line technology and sounding machines were used during the twentieth century, but by the twenty-first, [[echo sounding]] has increasingly displaced both of those methods.  A sounding line can still be found on many vessels as a backup to electronic depth sounding in the event of malfunction.  [[GPS]] has largely replaced the sextant and chronometer to establish one's position at sea, but many mariners still carry a sextant and chronometer as a backup.  So too with sounding lines.  While the echo sounder is used so long as it works, the sounding line is there when it doesn't work.  Many small craft still rely solely on a sounding line. 

The first practical [[fathometer]] (literally "fathom measurer"), which  determined water depth by measuring the time required for an echo to return from a high-pitched sound sent through the water and reflected from the sea floor, was invented by [[Herbert Grove Dorsey]] and patented in 1928.&lt;ref name=NOAAhistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/poletobeam2.html |title=Echo Sounding /  Early Sound Methods |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2006|website=National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  |publisher= NOAA Central Library|access-date= |quote=In answer to the need for a more accurate depth registering device, Dr. Herbert Grove Dorsey, who later joined the [[Coast and Geodetic Survey|C&amp;GS]], devised a visual indicating device for measuring relatively short time intervals and by which shoal and deep depths could be registered. In 1925, the C&amp;GS obtained the very first Fathometer, designed and built by the Submarine Signal Company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known  [[world map]]s date to [[classical antiquity]], the oldest examples of the 6th to 5th centuries BCE still based on the [[flat Earth]] paradigm.
World maps assuming a [[spherical Earth]] first appear in the [[Hellenistic period]].
The developments of [[Greek geography]] during this time, notably by [[Eratosthenes]] and [[Posidonius]] culminated in the Roman era, with [[Ptolemy world map|Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century CE), which would remain authoritative throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Since Ptolemy, knowledge of the approximate size of the globe allowed cartographers to estimate the extent of their geographical knowledge, and to indicate parts of the globe known to exist but not yet explored as ''[[terra incognita]]''.
With the [[Age of Discovery]], during the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate; exploration of [[Antarctica]] and the [[exploration of Africa|interior of Africa]] by western mapmakers was left to the 19th and early 20th century.

===Anaximander (c. 610&amp;nbsp;– 546 BCE)===
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|150px|Reconstruction of Anaximander's map]]
[[Anaximander]] (died c. 546 BCE) is credited with having created one of the first maps of the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/AncientWebPages/104.html Timechart of historical cartography: Antiquity]&lt;/ref&gt; which was circular in form and showed the known lands of the world grouped around the [[Aegean Sea]] at the center. This was all surrounded by the ocean.

===Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550–476 BCE)===
[[File:Hecataeus world map-en.svg|thumb|left|150px|Reconstruction of Hecataeus' map]]
[[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (died {{circa|lk=no|476}} BCE) is credited with a work entitled ''Ges Periodos'' ("Travels round the Earth" or "World Survey'), in two books each organized in the manner of a ''[[periplus]]'', a point-to-point coastal survey. One on [[Europe]], is essentially a periplus of the Mediterranean, describing each region in turn, reaching as far north as [[Scythia]]. The other book, on [[Asia]], is arranged similarly to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' of which a version of the 1st century CE survives. Hecataeus described the countries and inhabitants of the known world, the account of [[Egypt]] being particularly comprehensive; the descriptive matter was accompanied by a [[map]], based upon [[Anaximander]]'s map of the earth, which he corrected and enlarged. The work only survives in some 374 fragments, by far the majority being quoted in the geographical lexicon ''Ethnika'' compiled by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].

===Eratosthenes (276–194 BCE)===
[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|150px|1883 reconstruction of [[Eratosthenes]]' map&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancient%20Web%20Pages/112.html Source]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BCE) drew an improved world map, incorporating information from the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. [[Asia]] became wider, reflecting the new understanding of the actual size of the continent. Eratosthenes was also the first geographer to incorporate parallels and meridians within his cartographic depictions, attesting to his understanding of the spherical nature of the earth.

===Posidonius (c. 150–130 BCE)===
[[File:Worldmaphedo.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1628 reconstruction of [[Posidonius]] ideas about the positions of continents (many details couldn't have been known by Posidonius)]]
{{Main|Posidonius}}
[[Posidonius]] (or Poseidonius) of [[Apamea (Syria)|Apameia]] (c. 135–51 BCE), was a Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061021/Poseidonius "Greek philosopher, considered the most learned man of his time and, possibly, of the entire Stoic school."]&lt;/ref&gt; who traveled throughout the Roman world and beyond and was a celebrated [[polymath]] throughout the Greco-Roman world, like [[Aristotle]] and [[Eratosthenes]]. His work "about the ocean and the adjacent areas" was a general geographical discussion, showing how all the forces had an effect on each other and applied also to human life. He measured the [[Earth]]'s circumference by reference to the position of the star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]]. His measure of 240,000 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] translates to {{Convert|24,000|mi|}}, close to the actual circumference of {{Convert|24,901|mi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Poseidonius, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#202.K fragment 202]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was informed in his approach by Eratosthenes, who a century earlier used the elevation of the Sun at different latitudes. Both men's figures for the Earth's circumference were uncannily accurate, aided in each case by mutually compensating errors in measurement. However, the version of Posidonius' calculation popularised by [[Strabo]] was revised by correcting the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria to 3,750 stadia, resulting in a circumference of 180,000 stadia, or {{Convert|18,000|mi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lloyd Arnold [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh7nDfGm7BkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Story of Maps] Dover Publications (1979) pp29-31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] discussed and favored this revised figure of Posidonius over Eratosthenes in his ''Geographia'', and during the [[Middle Ages]] scholars divided into two camps regarding the circumference of the Earth, one side identifying with Eratosthenes' calculation and the other with Posidonius' 180,000 stadion measure.

===Strabo (c. 64 BCE – 24 CE)===
{{Main|Strabo|Geographica}}
Strabo is mostly famous for his 17-volume work ''Geographica'', which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.&lt;ref name="SG17"&gt;''Strabonis Geographica'', Book 17, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Geographica'' first appeared in Western Europe in Rome as a Latin translation issued around 1469. Although Strabo referenced the antique Greek astronomers Eratosthenes and [[Hipparchus]] and acknowledged their astronomical and mathematical efforts towards geography, he claimed that a descriptive approach was more practical. ''Geographica'' provides a valuable source of information on the ancient world, especially when this information is corroborated by other sources. Within the books of ''Geographica'' is a map of Europe. Whole world maps according to Strabo are reconstructions from his written text.

===Pomponius Mela (c. 43 CE)===
[[File:Karte Pomponius Mela rotated.jpg|thumb|150px|An 1898 reconstruction of [[Pomponius Mela]]s view of the World.]]
{{Main|Pomponius Mela}}
Pomponius is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence of [[antichthones]], people inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions due to the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from [[Alexander the Great]] (except [[Ptolemy]]) he regards the [[Caspian Sea]] as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian ([[Persian Gulf]]) and Arabian ([[Red Sea]]) gulfs on the south.

===Marinus of Tyre (c. 120 CE)===
{{Main|Marinus of Tyre}}
Marinus of Tyre's world maps were the first in the [[Roman Empire]] to show [[China]]. Around 120 CE, Marinus wrote that the habitable world was bounded on the west by the [[Fortunate Islands]]. The text of his geographical treatise however is lost. He also invented the [[equirectangular projection]], which is still used in map creation today. A few of Marinus' opinions are reported by Ptolemy. Marinus was of the opinion that the ''[[Oceanus|Okeanos]]'' was separated into an eastern and a western part by the continents ([[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]). He thought that the inhabited world stretched in latitude from [[Thule]] ([[Shetland]]) to [[Agisymba]] ([[Tropic of Capricorn]]) and in longitude from the [[Isles of the Blessed]] to [[China|Shera (China)]]. Marinus also coined the term [[Antarctic]], referring to the opposite of the [[Arctic Circle]]. His chief legacy is that he first assigned to each place a proper [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]; he used a "Meridian of the [[Isles of the Blessed]] ([[Canary Islands]] or [[Cape Verde Islands]])" as the [[zero meridian]].

Surviving texts of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]'', first composed {{circa|lk=no|150}}, note that he continued the use of Marinus's equirectangular projection for its regional maps while finding it inappropriate for maps of the [[Ecumene|entire known world]]. Instead, in Book VII of his work, he outlines three separate projections of increasing difficulty and fidelity. Ptolemy followed Marinus in underestimating the circumference of the world; combined with accurate absolute distances, this led him to also overestimate the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in terms of [[degree of arc|degrees]]. His [[prime meridian]] at the [[Fortunate Isles]] was therefore around 10 actual degrees further west of [[Alexandria]] than intended, a mistake that was corrected by [[Book of the Description of the Earth|Al-Khwārizmī]] following the translation of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] editions of Ptolemy into [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] in the 9th century. The oldest surviving manuscripts of the work date to [[Maximus Planudes]]'s restoration of the text a little before 1300 at [[Chora Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]); surviving manuscripts from this era seem to preserve separate recensions of the text which diverged as early as the 2nd or 4th century. A passage in some of the recensions credits an [[Agathodaemon (cartographer)|Agathodaemon]] with drafting a world map, but no maps seem to have survived to be used by Planude's monks. Instead, he commissioned new world maps calculated from Ptolemy's thousands of coordinates and drafted according to the text's 1st&lt;ref&gt;Vat. Urbinas Graecus 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2nd projections,&lt;ref&gt;Codex Seragliensis GI 57&lt;/ref&gt; along with the equirectangular regional maps. A copy was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Jacobus Angelus]] at [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] around 1406 and soon supplemented with maps on the 1st projection. Maps using the 2nd projection were not made in Western Europe until [[Nicolaus Germanus]]'s 1466 edition.{{refn|name=snyd|{{Citation |last=Snyder |first=John P. |title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections |p=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UzjTJ4w9yEC&amp;pg=PA14 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |date=1993}}}} Ptolemy's 3rd (and hardest) projection does not seem to have been used at all before [[Age of Discovery|new discoveries]] expanded the known world beyond the point where it provided a useful format.&lt;ref name=snyd/&gt;

[[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'' described the Earth as a globe of insignificant size in comparison to the remainder of the cosmos. Many medieval manuscripts of [[Macrobius]]' ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio'' include maps of the Earth, including the [[antipodes]], zonal maps showing the [[Clime#Ptolemy|Ptolemaic climate]]s derived from the concept of a spherical Earth and a diagram showing the Earth (labeled as ''globus terrae'', the sphere of the Earth) at the center of the hierarchically ordered planetary spheres.&lt;ref&gt;B.

===Tabula Peutingeriana (4th century)===
The [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (''Peutinger table'') is an [[itinerarium]] showing the ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the road network in the [[Roman Empire]]. It is a 13th-century copy of an original map dating from the 4th century, covering [[Europe]], parts of [[Asia]] ([[India]]) and North-[[Africa]]. The map is named after [[Konrad Peutinger]], a German 15th-16th-century humanist and antiquarian. The map was discovered in a library in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] by [[Conrad Celtes]], who was unable to publish his find before his death, and bequeathed the map in 1508 to Peutinger. It is conserved at the [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], [[Hofburg]], Vienna.

===Cosmas Indicopleustes' map (6th century)===
Around 550 [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] wrote the copiously illustrated ''[[Christian Topography]]'', a work partly based on his personal experiences as a merchant on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean in the early 6th century. Though his [[cosmogony]] is refuted by modern science, he has given a historic description of India and [[Sri Lanka]] during the 6th century, which is invaluable to historians. Cosmas seems to have personally visited the Kingdom of [[Axum]] in modern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], as well as [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. In 522 CE, he visited the [[Malabar Coast]] (South India). A major feature of his ''Topography'' is Cosmas' worldview that the [[world]] is [[flat earth|flat]], and that the [[sky|heavens]] form the shape of a box with a curved lid, a view he took from unconventional interpretations of [[Christian]] [[scripture]]. Cosmas aimed to prove that pre-Christian geographers had been wrong in asserting that the earth was spherical and that it was in fact modelled on the tabernacle, the house of worship described to Moses by God during the Jewish Exodus from Egypt.

The medieval [[T and O map]]s originate with the description of the world in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' of [[Isidore of Sevilla]] (died 636). This qualitative and conceptual type of medieval [[cartography]] represents only the top-half of a spherical Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Livingston, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020610/medieval_maps.shtml Modern Medieval Map Myths: The Flat World, Ancient Sea-Kings, and Dragons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209042605/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020610/medieval_maps.shtml |date=2006-02-09 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presumably tacitly considered a convenient [[map projection|projection]] of the inhabited portion of the world known in Roman and Medieval times (that is, the [[clime|northern temperate]] half of the globe). The ''T'' is the [[Mediterranean]], dividing the three [[continent]]s, [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], and the ''O'' is the surrounding [[Ocean]]. [[Jerusalem]] was generally represented in the center of the map. Asia was typically the size of the other two continents combined. Because the sun rose in the east, Paradise (the Garden of Eden) was generally depicted as being in Asia, and Asia was situated at the top portion of the map.

[[File:Cotton world map.jpg|thumb|150px|The Anglo-Saxon 'Cotton' world map (c. 1040).]]

===Anglo-Saxon ''Cotton'' world map (c. 1040)===
This map appears in a copy of a classical work on geography, the Latin version by [[Priscian]] of the ''Periegesis'', that was among the manuscripts in the [[Cotton library]] ([[MS. Tiberius]] B.V., fol. 56v), now in the [[British Library]]. It is not intended purely as an illustration to that work, for it contains much material gathered from other sources, including some which would have been the most up-to-date available, although it is based on a distant Roman original (similar to the source of [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Isidore-Seville-mappamundi.jpg another 11th-century world map], illustrating an edition of Isidore of Seville)—on which the network of lines appears to indicate the boundaries of [[Roman Empire|imperial]] provinces. The  date of drawing was formerly estimated at about CE 992–994, based on suggested links to the journey of [[Sigeric the Serious|Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury]] from Rome&lt;ref&gt;Siebold, Jim [http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/EMwebpages/210mono.html Slide 210 monograph: Cottoniana or Anglo-Saxon Map], via henry-davis.com - accessed 2008-02-04&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent analysis indicates that, although the information was revised about that time, the map was probably drawn between 1025 and 1050.&lt;ref&gt;British Library [http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=001COTTIBB00005U00056V00&amp;largeimage=1#largeimage Collect Britain], accessed 2008-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the later map by al-Idrisi (see below) this map is clearly outside the largely symbolic early medieval mapping tradition, but equally it is not based on the famous Ptolemaic co-ordinate system. East is at the top, but Jerusalem is not in the centre, and the Garden of Eden is nowhere to be seen. Unusually, all the waterways of Africa, not just the Red Sea, are depicted in red (mountains are green). The depiction of the far East is ambitious, including India and Taprobane (Sri Lanka)—the latter depicted according to the exaggerated classical conception of its size. Unsurprisingly, Britain itself is depicted in some detail. Great Britain, unusually by medieval standards, is shown as one island, albeit with an exaggerated Cornish promontory, and Mona, Ireland and the many Scottish islands are all indicated. The cartographer is slightly confused by Iceland, depicting it both by a version of its classical name 'Thule', north-west of Britain, and as 'Island', logically linked with Scandinavia.

It contains one of the oldest Christian world maps as an illustration of the ''Commentary''.  Although the original manuscript and map has not survived, copies of the map survive in several of the extant manuscripts.

The map is signed by one "Richard of [[Holdingham|Haldingham]] or [[Sleaford|Lafford]]". Drawn on a single sheet of [[vellum]], it measures {{convert|158|by|133|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the [[Red Sea]] coloured red).

{{Main|Catalan Atlas}}
The Catalan World Atlas was produced by the [[Majorcan cartographic school]] and is attributed to [[Cresques Abraham]]. It has been in the royal library of France (now the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) since the time of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. The Catalan Atlas originally consisted of 6 vellum leaves folded down the middle painted in various colors including gold and silver. The first two leaves contain texts in [[Catalan language]] covering [[cosmography]], [[astronomy]], and [[astrology]]. These texts are accompanied by illustrations. The texts and illustration emphasize the Earth's spherical shape and the state of the known world. They also provide information to sailors on tides and how to tell time at night.

Unlike many other nautical charts, the Catalan Atlas is read with the north at the bottom. As a result of this the maps are oriented from left to right, from the Far East to the Atlantic. The first two leaves, forming the oriental portion of the Catalan Atlas, illustrate numerous religious references as well as a synthesis of medieval mappae mundi (Jerusalem located close to the centre) and the travel literature of the time, notably [[Marco Polo]]'s Book of Marvels and the Travels and Voyage of [[Sir John Mandeville]]. Many Indian and Chinese cities can be identified.

The ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' ({{lang-zh|s=大明混一图|l=Amalgamated Map of the Great Ming Empire}}) world map, likely made in the late 14th or the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;
The place names on the map reflect the political situation in 1389, or the 22nd year of the reign of the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. Thus some Chinese scholars concluded that it was indeed created in 1389 or little later (Wang et al., ''Juanben caihui Daming Hunyi Tu yanjiu'' 绢本彩绘大明混一图研究 (As Regards the Da Ming Hun Yi Tu  Drawn in Colours on Stiff Silk), in: ''Zhongguo gudai dituji: Ming dai'' 中國古代地图集 明代 (An Atlas of Ancient Maps in China: The Ming dynasty (1368-1644)),  Beijing, 1994, pp. 51–55).
Others maintain that this reflects an earlier source and that the  ''Da Ming Hun Yi Tu'' itself was created much later (Miya Noriko, "Kon'itsu Kyōri Rekidai Kokuto no Zu" he no michi 「混一疆理歴代国都之図」への道, ''Mongoru jidai no shuppan bunka'' モンゴル時代の出版文化,  2006, 487–651 (pp. 511-512).&lt;/ref&gt;

The original world map was made by Fra Mauro and his assistant Andrea Bianco, a sailor-cartographer, under a commission by king [[Afonso V of Portugal]]. The map was completed on April 24, 1459, and sent to [[Portugal]], but did not survive to the present day. Fra Mauro died the next year while he was making a copy of the map for the Seignory of Venice, and the copy was completed by Andrea Bianco.

The map is preserved in the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]].

===Martellus world map (1490)===
The world map of [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]] (Heinrich Hammer), c. 1490, was remarkably similar to the terrestrial globe later produced by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492, the ''[[Erdapfel]]''. Both show heavy influences from [[Ptolemy]], and both possibly derive from maps created around 1485 in Lisbon by [[Bartolomeo Columbus]]. Although Martellus is believed to have been born in Nuremberg, Behaim's home town, he lived and worked in Florence from 1480 to 1496.

{{Main|Erdapfel}}
The ''Erdapfel'' ({{lang-de|earth apple}}) produced by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492 is considered to be the oldest surviving terrestrial [[globe]]. It is constructed of a laminated linen ball reinforced with wood and overlaid with a [[map]] painted by [[Georg Glockendon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuernberg.bayern-online.de/die-stadt/wissenswertes/der-behaim-globus/ Behaim Globe at Bayern-online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas are not included yet, as [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] returned to Spain no sooner than March 1493. It shows a rather enlarged Eurasian continent and an empty ocean between Europe and Asia. The [[Caribbean]] islands may already be represented as well, even before Colombus's return, under the name of the mythical [[Saint Brendan's Island]]. Japan and Asian islands are disproportionately large.  The idea to call the globe "apple" may be related to the [[Reichsapfel]] ("Imperial Apple", [[Globus cruciger]]) which was also kept in Nuremberg along with the [[Imperial Regalia]] ([[Reichskleinodien]]). In 1907, it was transferred to the [[Germanic Museum]] in [[Nuremberg]].

The [[Juan de la Cosa]], a Spanish cartographer, [[explorer]] and [[conquistador]], born in [[Santoña]] in the northern autonomous region of [[Cantabria]], made several maps of which the only survivor is the ''Mappa Mundi'' of 1500. It is the first known European cartographic representation of the [[Americas]]. It is now in the Museo Naval in [[Madrid]].

{{Main|Cantino planisphere}}
The ''[[Cantino planisphere]]'' or Cantino world map is the earliest surviving map showing [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discoveries in the east and west. It is named after Alberto Cantino, an agent for the  [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke of Ferrara]], who successfully smuggled it from Portugal to [[Italy]] in 1502. It shows the islands of the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Florida]] coastline, as well as Africa, Europe and Asia. The map is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the [[Brazil]]ian coast, discovered in 1500 by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] who conjectured whether it was merely an island &lt;ref&gt;Letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha, ''beijo as maãos de vosa alteza. deste porto seguro da vosa jlha da vera cruz'' (see original letter in archaic Portuguese, [http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Carta_a_El_Rei_D._Manuel_(ortografia_original) in the Portuguese Wikisource project): ''I kiss Your Majesty's Hands, from this safe haven of your island of Vera Cruz]&lt;/ref&gt; or part of the continent that several [[Spain|Spanish]] expeditions had just encountered farther north (cf. [[Amerigo Vespucci]]).

[[File:Caverio Map circa 1506.jpg|thumb|150px|Caverio Map (c.1505), Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris]]
{{Main|Caverio map}}
The [[Caverio Map]], also known as the Caveri Map or Canerio Map, is a map drawn by [[Nicolay de Caveri]], circa 1505. It is hand drawn on parchment and coloured, being composed of ten sections or panels, measuring {{convert|2.25|by|1.15|m|ft}}. Historians believe that this undated map signed with "Nicolay de Caveri Januensis" was completed in 1504–05. It was probably either made in [[Lisbon]] by the Genoese Canveri, or copied by him in [[Genoa]] from the very similar [[Cantino map]]. It shows the east coast of [[North America]] with surprising detail and was one of the primary sources used to make the [[Waldseemüller map]] in 1507. The Caverio map is currently at [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] in Paris.

===Ruysch World Map (1507)===
[[File:Ruysch map.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Johannes Ruysch|Ruysch]]'s 1507 map of the world]]
[[Johannes Ruysch]] an explorer, cartographer, astronomer and painter from the [[Low Countries]] produced the second oldest known printed representation of the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ruysch World Map: Census and Commentary |first=Donald L., Jr. |last=McGuirk |journal=Imago Mundi |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=133–141 |jstor= |doi=10.1080/03085698908592674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruysch map was published and widely distributed in 1507. It uses [[Ptolemy]]'s coniform projection, as does the [[Contarini-Rosselli]] 1506 map. Both document [[Christopher Columbus]]' discoveries as well as that of [[John Cabot]], including information from Portuguese sources and [[Marco Polo]]'s account.  There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Cuba]] are shown connected to Asia, as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[John Cabot|Cabot]] believed. “Sipganus” (Marco Polo’s Japan) is identical with “Spagnola” ([[Hispaniola]]) on the Ruysch map. The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and shows the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast and shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position.
Greenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch's map, and not Europe as earlier maps had showed. Around the north pole, Ruysch drew islands, based on reports in the book ''[[Inventio Fortunata]]'' of the English friar [[Nicholas of Lynne]]. The island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to [[Svalbard]], which was not discovered until 1597 (by [[Willem Barents]]).  Ruysch calls it 'European Hyberborea' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of 'Sancti Odulfi', St Olaf's church in [[Vardø]] on the [[Finnmark]] coast.

===Waldseemüller and Ringmann map (1507)===

The cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]] from southern Germany, supported by the mapping friend [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]], collected map data over several years, including information on the most recent discoveries, to build up a new collective work of geography and cartography. Along with a book they further incorporated, for the first time in history, the name ''America'' on a map, holding the strong opinion that it was a new continent that [[Amerigo Vespucci]] had discovered on his voyage and not only a few smaller islands as [[Christopher Columbus]] did in the ''[[List of islands in the Caribbean|West Indies]]''.

{{Main|Piri Reis map}}
The '''Piri Reis map''' is a famous world map created by 16th-century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] admiral and cartographer [[Piri Reis]]. The surviving third of the map shows part of the western coasts of Europe and North Africa with reasonable accuracy, and the coast of [[Brazil]] is also easily recognizable. Various Atlantic islands including the [[Azores]] and [[Canary Islands]] are depicted, as is the mythical island of [[Antillia]]. The map is noteworthy for its apparent south-eastward extension of the American continent to depict a southern landmass that some controversially claim is evidence for early awareness of the existence of [[Antarctica]]. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this is actually a record of the coast as far as [[Cape Horn]], explored secretly by Portuguese navigators before 1507 (when it appeared on the [[Waldseemüller map]]) and bent south-eastward simply to fit on the parchment.

===Diogo Ribeiro map (1527)===
[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|150px|World Map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]], "Propaganda map" (1529), Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]]
[[Diogo Ribeiro]], a Portuguese cartographer working for Spain, made what is considered the first scientific world map: the 1527 [[Padrón real]],  the first world map based on empiric latitude observations. There are 6 copies attributed to Ribeiro, including at the [[Weimar]] Grand Ducal Library (1527 ''Mundus Novus'') and at the [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]], in [[Vatican City]] (1529 ''[[Propaganda]] Map'' or ''Carta Universal'').&lt;ref&gt;"Carta Universal" (slide description, Ribeiro bio), Henry-Davis.com, webpage: [http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ren/Ren1/346mono HDav346].&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the map (''Mapamundi'') is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] trip around the world. Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. However, neither [[Australia]] nor [[Antarctica]] appear, and the [[Indian subcontinent]] is too small. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It also shows, for the first time, the [[North America]]n coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by the [[Estêvão Gomes]] exploration in 1525). It also shows the demarcation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

[[Flemish people|Flemish]] geographer and cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] world map of 1569 introduced a [[Map projection#Cylindrical|cylindrical map projection]] that became the standard map projection known as the [[Mercator projection]]. It was a large planisphere measuring {{Convert|202 by 124|cm||abbr=on}}, printed in eighteen separate sheets. While the linear scale is constant in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (which makes the projection [[conformal projection|conformal]]), the Mercator projection distorts the size and shape of large objects, as the scale increases from the Equator to the poles, where it becomes infinite. The title (''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigatium Emendate'': "new and augmented description of Earth corrected for the use of navigation") and the [[Mercator 1569 world map#Summary of the legends|map legends]]   show that the map was expressly conceived for the use of marine navigation. The principal feature of the projection is that [[Rhumb line]]s, sailing courses at a constant bearing, are mapped to straight lines on the map. The development of the Mercator projection represented a major breakthrough in the nautical cartography of the 16th century although it was only slowly adopted by seafaring nations.

{{Main|Theatrum Orbis Terrarum}}
The ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'' (or  "Theatre of the World") is considered to be the first true modern [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]. Written by [[Abraham Ortelius]] and originally printed on May 20, 1570, in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], it consisted of a collection of uniform [[map]] sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. The Ortelius atlas is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century [[cartography]]. Many of his atlas' maps were based upon sources that no longer exist or are extremely rare. Ortelius appended a unique source list (the "Catalogus Auctorum") identifying the names of contemporary cartographers, some of whom would otherwise have remained obscure. Three [[Latin]] editions of this (besides a [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a [[French language|French]] and a [[German language|German]] edition) appeared before the end of 1572; twenty-five editions came out before Ortelius' death in 1598; and several others were published subsequently, for the atlas continued to be in demand until approximately 1612.

The '''Bünting Clover Leaf Map''', also known as '''The World in a Cloverleaf''', ([[German language|German]] title: "''Die ganze Welt in einem Kleberblat/Welches ist der Stadt Hannover meines lieben Vaterlandes Wapen''") is an historic [[mappa mundi]] drawn by the [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant]] [[pastor]], [[theologist]], and [[cartographer]] [[Heinrich Bünting]]. The map was published in his book ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel through Holy Scripture) in 1581. 

Today the map is found within the Eran Laor maps collection in the [[National Library of Israel]] in [[Jerusalem]]. A mosaic model of the map is installed on the fence of [[Safra Square]] at the site of Jerusalem's city hall.

The map is a figurative illustration, in the manner of the medieval mappa mundi format, depicting the world via a [[clover]] shape.&lt;ref name="Carlton2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Genevieve Carlton|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MCkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-25545-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape is a symbolisation of the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]] and a component at the symbolisation of the German city [[Hanover]], where Bünting was born. The city of Jerusalem is represented as the centre, surrounded by three central continents, with some more areas of the world being accordingly illustrated separately from the clover.

The map is in [[Classical Chinese]], with detailed annotations and descriptions of various regions of the world, a brief account of the discovery of the Americas, [[Polar projection|polar projections]], scientific explanation of parallels and meridians, and proof that the sun is bigger than the moon. Following Chinese cartographical convention, Ricci placed China ("the Middle Kingdom") at the centre of the world. This map is a significant mark of the expansion Chinese knowledge of the world, and an important example of [[cultural syncretism]] directly between Europe and China. It was also exported to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] as well. &lt;ref name="Rothstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/arts/design/20map.html?pagewanted=1|title=Map That Shrank the World|last=Rothstein|first=Edward |date=2010-01-19|work=New York Times, Arts, EXHIBITION REVIEW |publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=20 January 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Geographica ac Hydrographica Tabula'' is a map of the world created by [[Henricus Hondius II|Hendrik Hondius]] in 1630, and published the following year at [[Amsterdam]], in the atlas ''Atlantis Maioris'' Appendix. Illustrations of the four elements of fire, air, water, and land are included. In the four corners, there are portraits of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Claudius Ptolemy]], and the atlas's first two publishers, [[Gerard Mercator]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]], the father of Hendrik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nova totius terrarum orbis geographica ac hydrographica tabula|url=http://maps.bpl.org/id/m8709|publisher=[[Norman B.

The Australian coastline shown is part of the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, discovered by [[Jan Carstensz]] in 1623. Curiously, the map does not show the west coast features shown in Gerritsz' Caert.

'''Exploration''' is the act of [[wikt:search|searching]] for the purpose of discovery of [[information]] or resources. Exploration occurs in all [[Sessility (zoology)|non-sessile]] animal species, including humans. In human [[history]], its most dramatic rise was during the [[Age of Discovery]] when [[European peoples|European]] explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, [[major explorations after the Age of Discovery]] have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.

In [[scientific research]], exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research (the other two being description and [[explanation]]). The term is often used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring the Internet, sexuality, etc.&lt;!-- How are these metaphors? They fit the definition - searching for the discovery of information. --&gt;

==Notable periods of human exploration==

===Phoenician galley sailings===
The [[Phoenicia]]ns (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Asia Minor]] though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. According to Virgil's [[Aeneid]] and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] was a Phoenician from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] who sailed to [[North Africa]] and founded the city of Carthage.

===Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa===
[[Hanno the Navigator]] (500 BC), a [[Carthage|Carthaginean]] navigator explored the Western Coast of [[Africa]].

===Greek &amp; Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule===
* The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] explorer from [[Marseille]], [[Pytheas]] (380 – ''c.'' 310 BC) was the first to circumnavigate [[Great Britain]], explore [[Germany]], and reach ''[[Thule]]'' (most commonly thought to be the [[Shetland Islands]] or [[Iceland]]).
* Romans -under [[Augustus]] emperor- reached and explored all the [[Baltic Sea]]

===Roman explorations ===
;Africa Exploration
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the [[Sahara]] desert with five different routes:

*through the western Sahara, toward the [[Niger]] river and actual [[Timbuktu]]. 
*through the Tibesti mountains, toward Lake Chad and actual [[Nigeria]] 
*through the [[Nile]] river, toward actual [[Uganda]]. 
*though the western coast of Africa, toward the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands. 
*through the [[Red Sea]], toward actual [[Somalia]] and perhaps [[Tanzania]].

All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor [[Nero]] seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of [[Ethiopia]] or [[Nubia]]: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.

One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Jonathan 2002. ''The Roman Army in Tripolitana and Gold Trade with Sub-Saharan Africa''. APA Annual Convention. New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the [[Indian Ocean]]).
Romans organized several explorations also in Northern Europe, and as far as Asia up to China .

;30 BC-640 AD: With the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, [[Roman trade with India|The Romans begin trading with India]]. The Empire now has a direct connection to the [[Spice trade]] Egypt had established beginning in 118 BC.

;100 AD-166 AD: [[Romano-Chinese relations]] begin. [[Ptolemy]] [[Geography (Ptolemy)|writes]] of the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]) and the trade port of [[Kattigara]], now identified as [[Óc Eo]] in northern [[Vietnam]], then part of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]], a province of the Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]]. The [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese historical texts]] describe Roman embassies, from a land they called ''[[Daqin]]''.

;2nd century: Roman traders reach [[Siam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Java]].

;161: An embassy from Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or his successor [[Marcus Aurelius]] reaches Chinese [[Emperor Huan of Han]] at [[Luoyang]].

;226: A Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits [[Nanjing]], China and the court of [[Sun Quan]], ruler of [[Eastern Wu]]

===Chinese exploration of Central Asia===
During the 2nd century BC, the [[Han dynasty]] explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]] (the Yuezhi had been evicted from [[Gansu]] by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the [[Hellenistic civilization|remnants of the conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336–323 BC).{{sfnm|di Cosmo|2002|1pp=247–249|Yü|1986|2p=407|Torday|1997|3p=104|4a1=Morton|4a2=Lewis|4y=2005|4pp=54–55}} When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi).{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=105–106}} Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the [[Indus River]] valley of [[Northwestern India]]) and Anxi ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories) further west.{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=108–112}}

===Viking Age===
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking settlements and voyages]]
From about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the [[Vikings]] explored Europe and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Viking]] explorer, [[Erik the Red]] (950–1003), sailed to and settled in [[Greenland]] after being expelled from [[Iceland]], while his son, the [[Iceland]]ic explorer [[Leif Ericson]] (980–1020), reached [[Newfoundland]] and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first [[Europe]]an to land in [[North America]].

===Polynesian Age===
[[File:Migraciones austronesias.png|thumb|[[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion map]]
[[Polynesians]] were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and [[Oceania|south Pacific]] for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered [[New Zealand]]. The key invention to their exploration was the [[outrigger canoe]], which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at [[Wairau Bar]] in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the [[Society Islands]]. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly [[trade winds]] to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between [[Cook Islanders]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Maori]]. Early Maori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Maori settlement in New Zealand.

Mathematical modelling based on DNA [[Identity by descent|genome studies]], using [[state-of-the-art]] techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100–200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280.  [[Otago University]] studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the [[Society Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Otago University. Wairau Bar Studies 2011.Dr L. Matisoo-Smith.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean===
The Chinese explorer, [[Wang Dayuan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1311–1350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328–1333, he sailed along the [[South China Sea]] and visited many places in [[Southeast Asia]] and reached as far as [[South Asia]], landing in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. Then in 1334–1339, he visited [[North Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. Later, the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433) made [[Treasure voyages|seven voyages]] to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].

===European Age of Discovery===
[[File:Viajes_de_colon_en.svg|thumb|300px|The Transatlantic [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] of [[Christopher Columbus]]]]
The [[Age of Discovery]], also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. [[Portuguese empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish empire|Spain]] dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as [[British empire|England]], [[Dutch empire|Netherlands]], and [[French colonial empire|France]].

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|300px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India run]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]
The most important explorers of this period include: [[Diogo Cão]] (c.1452 –c.1486) who discovered and ascended the [[Congo River]] and reached the coasts of the present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (c. 1450–1500), who was the first European to reach the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and other parts of the [[South Africa]]n coast; [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506), who led a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ([[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]) expedition across the Atlantic, [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovering America]]; [[Vasco da Gama]] (1460–1524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the [[East]]; [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]] (c. 1467/68–c.1520) who, following the path of Gama, claimed [[Brazil]] and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; [[Diogo Dias]], who discovered the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]] and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]] and [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (1470–1555), among others, who discovered and mapped the [[Mascarene Islands]] and other archipelagos; [[António de Abreu]] (c.1480–c.1514) and [[Francisco Serrão]] (14?–1521), who led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges), through the [[Sunda Islands]], reaching the [[Moluccas]]; [[Juan Ponce de León]] (1474–1521), who discovered and mapped the coast of [[Florida]]; [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] (c. 1475–1519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]]) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (1480–1521), who was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the [[Strait of Magellan]], the [[Tuamotus]] and [[Mariana Islands]], achieving a nearly complete [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time; [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] (1476–1526), who completed the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|global circumnavigation]]; [[Aleixo Garcia]] (14?–1527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], crossing the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reaching the [[Andes]] (near [[Sucre]]); [[Jorge de Menezes]] (c. 1498–?), who discovered [[Papua New Guinea]]; [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] (1490–1526), who discovered the [[Marshall Islands]]; [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] (1490–1558), who discovered the [[Mississippi River]] and was the first European to sail the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and cross [[Texas]]; [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557), who drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; [[Andres de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] (1510–1554), who discovered the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Colorado River]]; [[Francisco de Orellana]] (1511–1546), who was the first European to navigate the length of the [[Amazon River]].

[[File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png|thumb|300px|The routes of Captain [[James Cook]]'s voyages. The first voyage is shown in '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''', second voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;''', and third voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;'''.]]
Continuing in the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century with explorers such as [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] (1542–1595), who discovered the [[Tuvalu]] archipelago, the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Wake Island]]; [[Willem Janszoon]] (1570–1630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] (1565–1614), who discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] and the [[Vanuatu]] archipelago; [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez]], who discovered and reached eastern and northern [[New Guinea]]; [[Luis Váez de Torres]] (1565–1613), who discovered the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]; [[Henry Hudson]] (156?–1611), who explored the [[Hudson Bay]] in Canada; [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1574–1635), who explored  [[St. Lawrence River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (in Canada and northern United States); [[Abel Tasman]] (1603–1659), who explored North Australia, discovered [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]]; and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643–1687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.

Long after the golden age of discovery, other explorers ''completed'' the world map, such as various [[Russian Empire|Russians]] explorers, reaching the [[Siberia]]n Pacific coast and the [[Bering Strait]], at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); [[Vitus Bering]] (1681–1741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], the North American coast of [[Alaska]], and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and [[James Cook]], who explored the east coast of Australia, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and circumnavigated the Antarctic continent.

===Space exploration===
Humanity is continuing to follow the impulse to explore, moving beyond [[Earth]].  [[Space exploration]] started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric [[rocket]]s.  This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the [[moon]], and to send robotic explorers to other [[planet]]s and far beyond.

Both of the [[Voyager probes]] have left the [[Solar System]], bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.

==Behavioral trait==
{{splitsection|Mobilities|date=May 2018}}
{{see|Individual mobility}}
A 2015 study, performed on mobile phone data  and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in [[Italy]], demonstrated that  individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits, dubbed "returners" and "explorers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150908/ncomms9166/full/ncomms9166.html|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|display-authors=etal|volume=6|pages=8166|pmc=4569739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

* Alkaline: broadly conceived as natural [[habitats]] above pH 9 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Acidic: broadly conceived as natural habitats below pH 5 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Extremely cold: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently below -17&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes montane sites, polar sites, and deep ocean habitats.
* Extremely hot: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes sites with [[geological thermal]] influences such as Yellowstone and comparable locations worldwide or deep-sea vents.
* Hypersaline: (high salt) environments with salt concentrations greater than that of seawater, that is, &gt;3.5%. Includes salt lakes.
* Under pressure: broadly conceived as habitats under extreme hydrostatic pressure — i.e. aquatic habitats deeper than 2000 meters and enclosed habitats under pressure. Includes habitats in oceans and deep lakes.
* Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high [[radiation]] or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
* Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats.
* Without oxygen: broadly conceived as habitats without free oxygen - whether persistently, or with regular frequency, or for protracted periods of time. Includes habitats in deeper sediments.
* Altered by humans, i.e. anthropogenically impacted habitats. Includes mine tailings, oil impacted habitats, and pollution by [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or [[organic compound]]s.

The seven official geographical regions are the [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara Region]] (dark green), the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]] (light green), the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]] (blue), the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean Region]] (purple), the [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia Region]] (brown), the [[Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern Anatolia Region]] (orange), and the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Southeastern Anatolia Region]] (yellow)]]
The '''First Geography Congress''' ''([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Birinci Türk Coğrafya Kongresi)'', which was held in [[Ankara]] in 1941, separated [[Turkey]] into [[Regions of Turkey|seven geographical regions]], which are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2167/irgee216.0 A Comparative Analysis Regarding Pictures Included in Secondary School Geography Textbooks Taught in Turkey]{{dead link|date=September 2016|reason= effectively dead: offers only abstract, &amp; temp access starting at $41}}, Okan Yasar and Mehmet Seremet, ''International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The congress took numerous factors into consideration when defining these regions, including the fact that Turkey is surrounded by sea on three sides and the presence of mountain ranges lying parallel to the length of the coastline that isolate the central section from the influence of the sea.  Based on these factors and the resulting differences in the climate, natural plant cover and the distribution of types of agriculture, as well as the influences of these on the transportation systems and types of housing, the congress divided Turkey into four coastal and three central regions.

The coastal regions were named after the seas to which they are adjacent (the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea]], the [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]], the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]] and the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] Regions). The central regions were named according to their location in the whole of Anatolia ([[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central]], [[Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Southeastern]] Anatolia Regions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anatolia.com/regions_of_turkey/ Geographical Regions of Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geo-replication''' systems are designed to improve the distribution of data across geographically distributed [[Computer networking|data networks]]. This is intended to improve the response time for applications such as [[web portal]]s. Geo-replication can be achieved using software, hardware or a combination of the two. 

== Software ==
Geo-replication software is a [[network performance]]-enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or [[intranet]] content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations. It is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers, and then keeping the content on those servers up-to-date using heavily compressed data updates.

=== Portal acceleration ===
Geo-replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals, intranets, web applications, content and data between servers, across wide area networks [[Wide area network|WAN]] to allow users at remote sites to access central content at [[Local area network|LAN]] speeds. 

Geo-replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and periodic disconnection. [[Terabyte]]s of data can be replicated over a [[wide area network]], giving remote sites faster access to web applications.

Geo-replication software uses a combination of [[data compression]] and content [[web cache|caching]] technologies. [[Delta encoding|differencing]] technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal content accurate across all servers. This update compression can reduce the load that portal traffic place on networks, and improve the response time of a portal.

=== Portal replication ===
Remote users of web portals and collaboration environments will frequently experience network bandwidth and latency problems which will slow down their experience of opening and closing files, and otherwise interacting with the portal. Geo-replication technology is deployed to accelerate the remote end user portal performance to be equivalent to that experienced by users locally accessing the portal in the central office.

=== Differencing engine technologies ===
To deliver this reduction in the size of the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use differencing engine technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.

=== Offline portal replication on laptops === 
Geo-replication systems are often extended to deliver local replication beyond the server and down to the laptop used by a single user. Server to laptop replication enables mobile users to have access to a local replica of their business portal on a standard laptop. This technology may be employed to provide in the field access to portal content by, for example, sales forces and combat forces.

The '''geo URI scheme''' is a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) scheme defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s RFC 5870 (published 8 June 2010)&lt;ref name="RFC5870"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870|title=RFC 5870 - A Uniform Resource Identifier for Geographic Locations (geo URI)|date=2010-06-08|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for geographic locations using the 'geo' [[URI scheme|scheme name]].  A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional [[Spatial referencing system|coordinate reference system]] in a compact, simple, human-readable, and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]-independent way.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The current revision of the [[vCard]] specification&lt;ref name="RFC6350"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350|title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification|date=2011-08-11|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports geo URIs in a vCard's "GEO" property, and the [[GeoSMS]] standard uses geo URIs for [[geotagging]] SMS messages. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] based devices support geo URIs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.html|title=Android Intents List|publisher=google.com|date=|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.

A geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geourl.org/ |title=Geourl.org |publisher=Geourl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227152230/http://geourl.org/ |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which implements [[ICBM address]]).

==Example ==

A simple geo URI might look like:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677&lt;/code&gt;

where the two numerical values represent [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] respectively,&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and are separated by a [[comma]].&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; They are coordinates of an [[Horizontal position representation|horizontal grid]] (2D). If a third comma-separated value is present, it represents [[altitude]];&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, coordinates of a 3D  grid.  Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as altitudes below the coordinate reference system (depths) are signed negative with a leading dash.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; 

The geo URI also allows for an optional "uncertainty" value, separated by a [[semicolon]], representing the uncertainty of the location in meters, and is described using the "u" URI parameter.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; A geo URI with an uncertainty parameter looks as follows:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

A geo URI may, for example, be included on a web page, as [[HTML]]:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35"&gt;Wikimedia Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

so that a geo URI-aware [[user agent]] such as a [[web browser]] could launch the user's chosen mapping service; or it could be used in an [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feed or other [[XML]] file.

== Coordinate reference systems ==

The values of the coordinates only make sense when a [[coordinate reference system]] (CRS) is specified. The default CRS is the [[World Geodetic System|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS-84),&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and it is not recommended to use any other:

{{quote| The optional 'crs' URI parameter described below may be used by future specifications to define the use of CRSes other than WGS-84. This is primarily intended to cope with the case of another CRS  replacing WGS-84 as the predominantly used one, rather than allowing the arbitrary use of thousands of CRSes for the URI (which would clearly affect interoperability).&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;
}}

The only justified use of other CRS today is, perhaps, to preserve projection in [[Scale_(map)#Large-scale_maps_with_curvature_neglected|large-scale maps]], as local [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system|UTM]], or for non-terrestrial coordinates such as those on [[Moon|the Moon]] or [[Mars]].  The syntax and semantic of the CRS parameter, separated by a semicolon, is described at section 8.3 of RFC&amp;nbsp;5870. Examples:

* The [[Washington Monument]]'s location  expressed with [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#UTM_zone|UTM-zone 18S]] and its [http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18s/ standard ID]:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;crs=EPSG:32718;u=20&lt;/code&gt;
* A geo URI for a hypothetical lunar CRS created in 2011 might be:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;crs=Moon-2011;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

The order in which the semicolon-separated parameters occur is partially significant.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; Whilst the labeltext parameter and future parameters may be given in any order, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; parameters must come first. If both are used, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; must precede the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; All parameters are [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]],&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, imagining a future new parameter &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;, it can be ignored by simpler applications, and the above example is exactly equivalent to:
: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;CRS=epsg:32718;U=20;mapcolors=for_daltonic&lt;/code&gt;
Being in doubt, remember that use of the lowercase representation of parameter names (&lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;) is preferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4993">'''Geographic Data Files''' ('''GDF''') is an [[data exchange|interchange]] [[file format]] for [[geographic data]].
In contrast with generic [[Geographic information system|GIS]] formats, GDF provides detailed rules for data capture and representation, and an extensive catalog of standard features, attributes and relationships. The most recent extension expanded applicability further towards pedestrian [[navigation]], 3-D map rendering, and [[advanced driver-assistance systems]] (ADAS).

GDF is commonly used for data interchange in many industries such as [[automotive navigation system]]s, [[fleet management]], [[dispatch management]], [[road traffic analysis]], [[:Category:Road traffic management|traffic management]], and [[automatic vehicle location]].

Originated as a flat [[plain-text]] file, GDF is not intended to be used directly for any large scale geographic application and normally requires conversion into a more efficient format. Consumability has been increased with most-recent developments for XML and SQL renditions.

The maps in GDF format are provided by many map vendors such as [[Here (company)|HERE]], [[TomTom]], [[Mapscape BV]], [[GeoSmart]], [[Automotive Navigation Data]], [[AutoNavi]] and  [[NavInfo]].

==Standardisation==

GDF is an international standard that is used to model, describe and transfer [[road network]]s and other geographic data.

The standard was initially drawn up by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] in co-operation with digital map providers, automotive and electronic equipment manufacturers. The outcome of these standardisation efforts (CEN GDF 3.0, or ENV14825:1996) has formed the major input to a global standard created by ISO/TC204 Sub [[Working group]] 3:
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] GDF 4.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2004, now replaced by
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] GDF 5.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2011.

However, despite the existence of an ISO GDF standard, the nature of model abstractions as well as semantic interpretations and proprietary content extensions lead to [[interoperability]] issues between flavors of GDF map products from different vendors.  In practice the GDF files are not fully interchangeable due to vendor specific extensions. To this end, GDF5.0 provides major improvements in terms of extended meta data and flags for signalling implementation choices.

===The new GDF5.0===

The specifications of GDF5.0 were developed and compiled between 2001 and 2008, involving experts from Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. Extensive activities towards harmonization with ISO/TC211 standards were undertaken. GDF 5.0 was published in July 2011.

Major GDF5.0 enhancements include UML model migration &amp; refinements; harmonization with [[linear referencing]] and geo-spatial web standards; support for 3-D content and time coordinates; comprehensive character set and [[phonetic representation]]s; and new XML and SQL based delivery formats.

===Background and rationale of GDF standardization===

By the late 1980s, producers and users of digital road map data became increasingly aware of the need for a common data interchange standard. Lack of such a standard was seen as an impediment to the commercial growth and success of industries using such data. Before the advent of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) industry, development of spatial data interchange standards was done mostly on a regional basis and not designed for the specialised requirements of road transport-related applications.

In the 1990s, the GDF standard was instrumental in enabling the European [[business-to-business]] (B2B) market for in-vehicle navigation in that it provided interoperability for exchanging digital map data between map manufacturers and navigation system integrators. The GDF specifications provided a base for both the capturing of geographic content and the exchanging of it. Its original design foresaw a powerful, application-independent model, while its initial rendition as a standard specifically addressed the requirements for the richness of navigable map databases. Since then, GDF has evolved in terms of data modelling capabilities, broadened international applicability, expanded geographic domains, and diversified exchange formats. As a result, GDF covers a wide range of application domains and has been adapted to many geo-spatial technologies.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:
* the "art of government"&lt;ref name="burchell1"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmentality', trans. Rosi Braidotti and revised by Colin Gordon, in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;87–104.|author=Foucault, M.|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "how" of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"&gt;[Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) 'Governmentality, Governance and China' in China's Governmentalities,  (ed.) Elaine Jeffreys, {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "governmental rationality"&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmental rationality: an introduction', in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–48.|author=Gordon, C|year=1991|publisher=Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a 'guideline' for the analysis that Michel Foucault offers by way of historical reconstructions embracing a period starting from Ancient Greece right through to modernity and neo-liberalism"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, '''The Government of Self and Others: Lectures at the Collège de France 1982-1983''' (2010) http://rauli.cbs.dk/index.php/foucault-studies/article/view/3127/3298.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Courage of Truth : Lectures at the Collège de France 1983-1984''' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Birth of Biopolitics Lectures At The College de France 1978-1979''' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "the techniques and strategies by which a society is rendered governable"&lt;ref&gt;'''Foucault, Governmentality, and Critique'''(2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102830/http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 'reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing'&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., (2008), ''The birth of biopolitics. Lectures at the College de France, 1978‐79. Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in [[Velm]], Belgium, during a sunny day]]
A '''grassed waterway''' consists in a {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native [[grassland]] strip of [[green belt]]. It is generally installed in the [[thalweg]], the deepest continuous line along a [[valley]] or [[watercourse]], of a cultivated dry valley in order to control [[erosion]]. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in [[Bavaria]] showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Confusion between "grassed waterway" and "vegetative filter strips" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, [[buffer strip]] can be a [[synonym]], with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a [[riparian zone]].

== Runoff and erosion mitigation ==
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]
[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the [[thalweg]] where it can lead to rill or [[gully]] erosion.   

Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a [[muddy flood]]. 

In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology  100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hansen's problem''' is a problem in planar [[surveying]], named after the astronomer [[Peter Andreas Hansen]] (1795&amp;ndash;1874), who worked on the geodetic survey of Denmark. There are two known points ''A'' and ''B'', and two unknown points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; an observer measures the angles made by the lines of sight to each of the other three points.  The problem is to find the positions of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. See figure; the angles measured are&amp;nbsp;(''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Since it involves observations of angles made at unknown points, the problem is an example of [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] (as opposed to intersection).

== Solution method overview==

Define the following angles: 
''&amp;gamma;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''AP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''AB'', ''&amp;psi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BA''.
As a first step we will solve for ''&amp;phi;'' and ''&amp;psi;''.
The sum of these two unknown angles is equal to the sum of ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\phi+\psi=\beta_1+\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

A second equation can be found more laboriously, as follows.  The [[law of sines]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_2 B}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2}{\sin \phi}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2 B}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \phi \sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Entirely analogous reasoning on the other side yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these two equal gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \phi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2} = k.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a known [[trigonometric identity]] this ratio of sines can be expressed as the tangent of an angle difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\phi - \psi}{2}=\frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan\frac{\phi+\psi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the second equation we need. Once we solve the two equations for the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we can use either of the two expressions above for &lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}&lt;/math&gt; to find ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since ''AB'' is known.  We can then find all the other segments using the law of sines.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Hebisch: Ebene und Sphaerische Trigonometrie, Kapitel 1, Beispiel 4 (2005, 2006)[http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~hebisch/skripte/sphaerik/strigo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution algorithm ==
We are given four angles (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the distance ''AB''.  The calculation proceeds as follows:

* Calculate &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\pi-\alpha_1-\beta_1-\beta_2,\quad \delta=\pi-\alpha_2-\beta_1-\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;s=\beta_1+\beta_2, \quad d=2 \arctan \left[ \frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan(s/2)\right]&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;\phi=(s+d)/2, \quad \psi=(s-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate 
::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \phi \sin \delta}{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: or equivalently

::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

: If one of these fractions has a denominator close to zero, use the other one.

A '''position representation''' is the parameters used to express a position relative to a reference. Representing position in three dimensions is often done by a [[Euclidean vector]]. However, when representing position relative to the [[Earth]] it is often more convenient to represent vertical position as [[altitude]] or depth, and to use some other parameters to represent '''horizontal position'''. There are also several applications where only the horizontal position is of interest, this might e.g. be the case for ships and ground vehicles/cars.

There are several options for horizontal position representations, each with different properties which makes them appropriate for different applications. [[Latitude]]/[[longitude]] and [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] are common horizontal position representations.

The horizontal position has two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], and thus two parameters are sufficient to uniquely describe such a position. However, similarly to the use of [[Euler angles]] as a [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|formalism for representing rotations]], using only the minimum number of parameters gives [[mathematical singularity|singularities]], and thus three parameters are required for the horizontal position to avoid this.

==Latitude and longitude==
{{Main|Latitude|Longitude}}

The most common horizontal position representation is [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. The parameters are intuitive and well known, and are thus suited for communicating a position to humans, e.g. using a position plot.

However, latitude and longitude should be used with care in mathematical expressions (including calculations in computer programs). The main reason is the [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], which makes longitude undefined at these points. Also near the poles the latitude/longitude grid is highly non-linear, and several errors may occur in calculations that are sufficiently accurate on other locations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gade |first1= Kenneth |year= 2010 |title= A non-singular horizontal position representation |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 63 |issue= 3 |pages=395–417 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/A_Nonsingular_Horizontal_Position_Representation.pdf| format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463309990415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problematic area is the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] at ±[[180th meridian|180°]] longitude, where the longitude has a [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]], and hence specific program code must often be written to handle this. An example of the consequences of omitting such code is the crash of the navigation systems of twelve [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter aircraft while crossing this meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itnews.com.au/News/74081,stealth-fighters-hit-by-software-crash.aspx |title=Stealth fighters hit by software crash |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''n''-vector==
{{Main|n-vector}}

[[n-vector|''n''-vector]] is a three parameter [[mathematical singularity|non-singular]] horizontal position representation that can replace latitude and longitude. Geometrically, it is a [[unit vector]] which is normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in an [[ECEF|Earth centered earth fixed]] [[coordinate system]]. It behaves the same at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical [[Injective function|one-to-one]] property. The vector formulation makes it possible to use standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]], and thus ''n''-vector is well-suited for mathematical calculations, e.g. adding, subtracting, interpolating and averaging positions.

Using three parameters, ''n''-vector is inconvenient for communicating a position directly to humans and before showing a position plot, a [[n-vector#Converting n-vector to latitude/longitude|conversion to latitude/longitude]] might be needed.

==Local flat Earth assumption==
When carrying out several calculations within a limited area, a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] might be defined with the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] at a specified Earth-fixed position. The origin is often selected at the surface of the reference ellipsoid, with the ''z''-axis in the vertical direction. Hence (three dimensional) position vectors relative to this coordinate frame will have two horizontal and one vertical parameter. The axes are typically selected as [[North East Down|North-East-Down]] or [[East North Up|East-North-Up]], and thus this system can be viewed as a [[linearization]] of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] and [[Circle of latitude|parallels]].

For small areas a local coordinate system can be convenient for relative positioning, but with increasing (horizontal) distances, errors will increase and repositioning of the [[tangent point]] may be required. The alignment along the north and east directions is not possible at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], and near the Poles these directions might have significant errors (here the linearization is valid only in a very small area).

==UTM==
{{Main| Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system}}
Instead of one local Cartesian grid, that needs to be repositioned as the position of interest moves, a fixed set of [[map projections]] covering the Earth can be defined. [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] is one such system, dividing the Earth into 60 longitude zones (and with [[Universal Polar Stereographic coordinate system|UPS]] covering the [[Polar regions]]).

UTM is widely used, and the coordinates approximately corresponds to meters north and east. However, as a set of map-projections it has inherent [[distortions]], and thus most calculations based on UTM will not be exact. The crossing of zones gives additional complexity.

==Comparison==
When deciding which parameters to use for representing position in a specific application, there are several properties that should be considered. The following table gives a summary of what to consider.

In [[geography]], [[statistics]] and [[archaeology]], a '''settlement''', '''locality''' or '''populated place''' is a [[community]] in which people live. The complexity of a settlement can range from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. Settlements may include [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, [[village]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].  A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by  particular people.

In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as [[road]]s, [[enclosure]]s, [[field systems]], [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundary]] banks and [[ditch]]es, [[pond]]s, [[park]]s and [[wood]]s, [[windmill|wind]] and [[water mill]]s, [[manor house]]s, [[moat]]s and [[church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/msrg/msrgpolicy.htm  Medieval Settlement Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000&amp;nbsp;BC at the [[Ohalo]] site (now underwater) near the edge of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The [[Natufian]]s built houses, also in the [[Levant]], around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. Remains of settlements such as [[village]]s become much more common after the invention of agriculture.

== In landscape history ==
[[File:Eoste Keldrimägi.JPG|thumb|Some settlement sites may go out of use. This location in [[Estonia]] was used for human settlement in 2nd half of first millennium and it is considered an [[archaeological record]], that may provide information on how people lived back then.]]
[[Landscape history]] studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]] or [[nucleated village|nucleated]]. [[Urban morphology]] can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a [[settlement hierarchy]].

== Statistics ==

=== Australia ===
[[Geoscience Australia]] defines a populated place as "a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |title= NTMS Specifications (250K &amp; 100K): Populated place |publisher= [[Australian Government]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603115645/http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |archive-date= June 3, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia]] used the term [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] for rural areas, while the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the term "urban centres/localities" for urban areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] uses the term "populated place" for rural, and "municipality" and  "town" for urban areas.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian government uses the term "populated place" in the ''[[Atlas of Canada]]'', but does not define it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |title=Glossary Search Results |work=[[Atlas of Canada]] |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006185826/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] uses the term [[Census geographic units of Canada#Localities|localities]] for historical named locations.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] records population in units called [[settlement (Croatia)|settlements (''naselja'')]].

=== India ===
The Census Commission of [[India]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Ireland ===
The  [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Russia ===
There are various [[types of inhabited localities in Russia]].

=== Sweden ===
[[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term [[Urban areas in Sweden|localities (''tätort'')]] for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is ''urban areas''.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] uses the term "urban settlement" to denote an [[urban area]] when analysing census information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/urbansettlement2001 Urban Settlement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Registrar General for Scotland]] defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to [[population density]] and [[postcode]] areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf Scottish census information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162030/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has a [[Geographic Names Information System]] that defines three classes of human settlement:
# '''Populated place''' − [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]] with clustered or scattered [[building]]s and a permanent human [[population]] (city, settlement, town, village).  A populated place is usually not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding "civil" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:8:3692675055014428 |title= Feature Class Definitions |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Census''' − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;
# '''Civil''' − a political division formed for administrative purposes ([[borough]], [[county]], [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated place]], [[municipio]], [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], [[town]], [[township]])."&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Populated places may be specifically defined in the context of [[census]]es and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|"place" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau]] or [[census-designated place]]s.

== Geospatial modeling ==
In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Human Settlement Layer ([http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL]) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL] operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).

Populated places can be abandoned.  Sometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a [[ghost town]], and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The '''International Ice Patrol''' is an organization with the purpose of monitoring the presence of [[iceberg]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]s and reporting their movements for safety purposes. It is operated by [[United States Coast Guard]] but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/iip/2011_IIP_Annual_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was established in 1914 in response to the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']]. The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to alert any seacraft traveling the [[great circle]] shipping lanes between Europe and the major ports of the United States and Canada of the presence of any icebergs there. &lt;ref&gt;A.J.

==History==
=== Founding ===
From the earliest journeys into the [[North Atlantic]], icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]. For example, [[Lady of the Lake (brig)|''Lady of the Lake'']] sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of [[whaling]] and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of the {{ship|RMS|Titanic}} on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.

On her maiden voyage from [[Southampton, England]] bound for New York, ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. ''Titanic'', the brand new ship of the [[White Star Line]], was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of {{convert|22|kn|km/h|0}}. Loss of ''Titanic'' gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the ''Titanic'' disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first [[Safety of Life at Sea]] ([[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]]) convention in 1914. 

After the ''Titanic'' disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers {{USS|Chester|CL-1|6|}} and {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}} to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] could not spare ships for this purpose, so the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] (forerunner of the [[United States Coast Guard]]) assumed responsibility, assigning the [[USCGC Seneca (1908)|USRC ''Seneca'']] and [[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USRC ''Miami'']] to conduct the patrol.

At the first [[International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea]], which was convened in [[London]] on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation.

The second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 &amp; 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol.

Every year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the ''Titanic'' disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the ''Titanic'' and her lost passengers is read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2011/04/15/uscg_marks_99th_anniversary_of_titanic_sinking/ "USCG Marks 99th Anniversary of Titanic Sinking"], boston.com,  Associated Press (New London, Connecticut), 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From  Steamboat Inspection Service to U.S. Coast Guard: Marine Safety in the United States from 1838 - 1946.

=== Administration ===
From its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, {{USCGC|Evergreen|WLB-295|6}}, was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.

From 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] during the ice season.

Due to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to [[Governors Island, New York]]&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Osmer, Stephen R., LTJG USCG "The Aerial Ice Patrol: No More ''Titanics''s" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' March 1976 pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; where they remained until October 1983. 

Today the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in [[New London, Connecticut]]. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in a [[HC-130]] aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland.

The Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart.  Ice Patrol information is also available via http Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season.

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
[[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. and B.T. Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2):87–96; Wiens, J.A.: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds) 1999: Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383; cf. Wiens, J.A. 2005: ''Toward a unified landscape ecology''. In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===
{{Main article|Landscape archaeology|Historical ecology}}
[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|220px|left|thumb|[[Medieval]] Ridge and Furrow above [[Wood Stanway]], [[Gloucestershire]], England.]]
Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf].

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===
{{See also|Pastoral|British regional literature|American literary regionalism}}

====The earliest landscape literature====
[[File:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape]]
Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian aboriginal myths]]  (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]), the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A. (Eds) ''An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.'' Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hambledon Hill towards Stourton Tower 20070730.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vale of Blackmore]], the main setting for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''. [[Hambledon Hill]] towards [[King Alfred's Tower|Stourton Tower]] ]]

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

&lt;/poem&gt;|source =from ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805), Book 13, lines 41-51.&lt;br&gt;by [[William Wordsworth]]
}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape art===

====Landscape photography====
{{Main article|Landscape photography|Conservation photography|Aerial photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942) photograph by [[Ansel Adams]]]]
Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.
{{Clear}}

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8812">'''Least squares adjustment''' is a model for the solution of an [[overdetermined system]] of equations based on the principle of [[least squares]] of [[observation residuals]]. It is used extensively in the disciplines of [[surveying]], [[geodesy]], and [[photogrammetry]]—the field of [[geomatics]], collectively.

==Formulation==
There are three forms of least squares adjustment: ''parametric'', ''conditional'', and ''combined''. In '''parametric adjustment''', one can find an observation equation ''h(X)=Y'' relating observations ''Y'' explicitly in terms of parameters ''X'' (leading to the A-model below). In '''conditional adjustment''', there exists a condition equation ''g(Y)=0'' involving only observations ''Y'' (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters ''X'' at all. Finally, in a '''combined adjustment''', both parameters ''X'' and observations ''Y'' are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation ''f(X,Y)=0''. Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when ''f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y'' and ''f(X,Y)=g(Y)'', respectively. Yet the special cases warrant simpler solutions, as detailed below. Often in the literature, ''Y'' may be denoted ''L''.

==Solution==
The equalities above only hold for the estimated parameters &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and observations &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f\left(\hat{X},\hat{Y}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, measured observations &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; and approximate parameters &lt;math&gt;\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; produce a nonzero ''misclosure'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} = f\left(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
One can proceed to [[Taylor series expansion]] of the equations, which results in the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobians]] or [[design matrix|design matrices]]: the first one,
:&lt;math&gt;A=\partial{f}/\partial{X};&lt;/math&gt;
and the second one,
:&lt;math&gt;B=\partial{f}/\partial{Y}.&lt;/math&gt;
The linearized model then reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} + A \hat{x} + B \hat{y} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{X}-\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; are estimated ''parameter corrections'' to the ''a priori'' values, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{Y}-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are post-fit ''observation [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]''.

In the parametric adjustment, the second design matrix is an identity, ''B=-I'', and the misclosure vector can be interpreted as the pre-fit residuals, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}=\tilde{w}=h(\tilde{X})-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, so the system simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;A \hat{x} = \hat{y} - \tilde{y},&lt;/math&gt;
which is in the form of [[ordinary least squares]]. 
In the conditional adjustment, the first design matrix is null, ''A=0''.
For the more general cases, [[Lagrange multipliers]] are introduced to relate the two Jacobian matrices and transform the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constrained]] least squares problem into an unconstrained one (albeit a larger one). In any case, their manipulation leads to the &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt; vectors as well as the respective parameters and observations ''a posteriori'' covariance matrices.

===Computation===
Given the matrices and vectors above, their solution is found via standard least-squares methods; e.g., forming the [[normal matrix]] and applying [[Cholesky decomposition]], applying the [[QR factorization]] directly to the Jacobian matrix, [[iterative methods]] for very large systems, etc.

*The use of ''a priori'' parameter covariance matrix is akin to [[Tikhonov regularization]]

==Extensions==
If [[rank deficiency]] is encountered, it can often be rectified by the inclusion of additional equations imposing constraints on the parameters and/or observations, leading to [[constrained least squares]].

{{Refimprove|date = November 2014}}A '''line laser''' is a [[laser]] modified to project a line rather than a point (e.g. [[laser pointer]]).  This may be achieved by passing the beam through a [[cylindrical lens]] or a Powell lens.

Using multiple lasers, it is possible to project multiple lines for use with [[image processing]].  

Depending on the application, line lasers can generate lines, crosses or other patterns.  Civil engineering and interior design projects can use line lasers to measure the [[levelling]] of a small building site.

==Tors in Great Britain==

===Dartmoor===
{{details|topic=Dartmoor's tors|List of Dartmoor tors and hills}}
[[File:Saddle tor to Hey tor pano.jpg|Panorama of some of Dartmoor's tors in the snow|right|thumb]]
Dartmoor represents one of the largest areas of exposed granite in the United Kingdom, covering an area of 368 square miles (954 square kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm Dartmoor National Park Authority website. Retrieved 12 October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074307/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm |date=5 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a chain of granite stretching through Cornwall, as far as the [[Isles of Scilly]].

Some of the more durable granite survived to form the rocky crowns of Dartmoor tors. One of the best known is at [[Haytor]], on the eastern part of the moor, whose granite is of unusually fine quality and was quarried from the hillside below the tor during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its stone was used to construct the pillars outside the [[British Museum]] in London, and to build [[London Bridge]]. The last granite to be quarried there was used to build [[Exeter]] War Memorial in 1919.

[[Ten Tors]] is an annual weekend [[hiking|hike]] on Dartmoor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33540">[[File:Visits by Elizabeth II.svg|thumb|300px|Overseas trips made by Elizabeth II. A darker colour corresponds to a greater number of visits]]
Since ascending the throne in 1952, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has undertaken a number of state and official visits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/sites/default/files/media/state_visits_paid_by_the_queen_with_the_duke_of_edinburgh_2.pdf |title=Outward State visits since 1955 |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II|trips throughout the Commonwealth]], making her the most widely travelled [[head of state]] in history. The Queen does not require a [[British passport]] for travelling overseas,  as all British passports are issued in her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/passports|title=Passports|date=15 January 2016|publisher=Official website of the royal family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sovereign of more than one independent state, Elizabeth II has represented both Canada and the United Kingdom on [[state visit]]s, though the former on just two occasions. For the countries where Elizabeth II is sovereign, other than the United Kingdom, the relevant [[Governor-General#Independent Commonwealth realms|governor-general]] will usually carry out state visits on the Queen's behalf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1985">[[File:Loxodrome.png|thumb|300px | Rhumb line navigation path: &amp;beta; = constant]]
'''Loxodromic navigation''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λοξóς'', oblique, and ''δρóμος'', path) is a method of navigation by following a [[rhumb line]], a curve on the surface of the [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] that follows the same angle at the intersection with each [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. This serves to maintain a steady course in sailing.&lt;ref name="WeintritNeumann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adam Weintrit|author2=Tomasz Neumann|title=Methods and Algorithms in Navigation: Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=buMsPGyE7boC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=loxodromic+navigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIZeu8DBp5&amp;sig=1UcvzLLnZjKTSpaS9ECPnMmpidU&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBWoVChMIq9ztmPzSyAIViXEUCh03eAKe#v=onepage&amp;q=loxodromic%20navigation&amp;f=false|date=7 June 2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-415-69114-7|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navigating on a spherical surface with a fixed [[course (navigation)|course]] (&lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; in the figure) results in a spiral path that approaches the [[North Pole]] for courses ranging from 270º to 090º and the [[South Pole]] for courses from 090º to 270º. On a [[nautical chart]] plotted according to the [[Mercator projection]], a loxodromic course appears as a straight line.

:'' Redirected here: '''feet above sea level'''
'''Metres above mean sea level''' ('''MAMSL''') or simply '''metres above sea level''' ('''MASL''' or '''m a.s.l.''') is a [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|standard]] [[metric system|metric]] [[measurement]] in [[metres]] of the [[elevation]] or [[altitude]] of a location in reference to a historic mean [[sea level]]. Mean sea levels are affected by [[climate change]] and other factors and change over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.

== Uses ==

Metres above sea level is the standard measurement of the elevation or altitude of:
* [[Geographic location]]s such as [[town]]s, [[mountain]]s and other [[landmark]]s.
* The top of [[building]]s and other [[nonbuilding structure|structure]]s.
* Flying objects such as [[airplane]]s or [[helicopters]].

== How it is determined ==

The elevation or altitude in metres above sea level of a location, object, or point can be determined in a number of ways. The most common include:
* [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), which triangulates a location in reference to multiple [[Artificial Satellite|satellite]]s.
* [[Altimeter]]s. They typically measure [[atmospheric pressure]], which decreases as altitude increases.
* [[Aerial photography]].
* [[Surveying]].

Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex. Land mass subsidence (as occurs naturally in some islands) can give the appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.

== Other measurement systems ==

[[Foot (length)|Feet]] above sea level is the most common analogue for metres above sea level in the US customary measurement system.

== Abbreviations ==

Metres above sea level is commonly abbreviated mamsl or MAMSL, based on the abbreviation AMSL for [[above mean sea level]]. Other abbreviations are m.a.s.l.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ricardo Bressani | first = Ricardo |author2=Carlos Chon | year = 1996 | title = Effects of altitude above sea level on the cooking time and nutritional value of common beans | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Formerly Qualitas Plantarum) | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–61 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/H05M8274480PJTM4.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-06 | doi = 10.1007/BF01092522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MASL.&lt;ref name ="TD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Meters above Sea Level - What does MSL stand for?

'''Ordnance Survey''' ('''OS''') is a [[national mapping agency]] in the United Kingdom which covers the island of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ordnance-survey |title=Ordnance Survey |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 April 2015 it has operated as Ordnance Survey Ltd, a [[state-owned enterprise|government-owned company]], 100% in public ownership. The Ordnance Survey Board remains accountable to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It is also a member of the [[Public Data Group]].

The agency's name indicates its original military purpose (see [[Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] and [[surveying]]), which was to map [[Scotland]] in the wake of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. There was also a more general and nationwide need in light of the potential threat of invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Ordnance Survey mapping is usually classified as either "large-scale" (in other words, more detailed) or "small-scale". The Survey's large-scale mapping comprises 1:2,500 maps for urban areas and 1:10,000 more generally. (The latter superseded the 1:10,560 "six [[inch]]es to the [[mile]]" scale in the 1950s.) These large scale maps are typically used in professional [[Land use|land-use]] contexts and were available as sheets until the 1980s, when they were [[Digitizing|digitised]]. Small-scale mapping for leisure use includes the 1:25,000 "Explorer" series, the 1:50,000 "Landranger" series and the 1:250,000 road maps. These are still available in traditional sheet form.

Ordnance Survey maps remain in [[copyright]] for fifty years after their &lt;!-- [first?] --&gt; publication. Some of the [[Copyright library|Copyright Libraries]] hold complete or near-complete collections of pre-digital OS mapping.

==Origins==
The origins of the Ordnance Survey lie in the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] which was finally defeated by forces loyal to the government at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]] realised that the British Army did not have a good map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] to locate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] dissenters such as [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]] so that they could be put on trial.{{sfn|Hewitt|2010|p=xix}} In 1747, Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson proposed the compilation of a map of the Highlands to help to subjugate the clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=Whitworth |authorlink=Whitworth Porter |year=1889 |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers |volume=I |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co |publication-place=London |pages=167–68 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=lqlBAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=14 August 2008 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] charged Watson with making a military survey of the Highlands under the command of the Duke of Cumberland. Among Watson's assistants were [[William Roy]], [[Paul Sandby]] and John Manson. The survey was produced at a scale of 1&amp;nbsp;inch to 1000 yards (1:36,000){{sfn|Hindle|1998|pp=114-115}} and included "the Duke of Cumberland's Map" (primarily by Watson and Roy), now held in the [[British Library]].

Roy later had an illustrious career in the [[Royal Engineers]] (RE), rising to the rank of General, and he was largely responsible for the British share of the work in determining the relative positions of the French and British royal observatories. This work was the starting point of the [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]] (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself. Roy's technical skills and leadership set the high standard for which Ordnance Survey became known. Work was begun in earnest in 1790 under Roy's supervision, when the [[Board of Ordnance]] (a predecessor of part of the modern [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) began a national military survey starting with the south coast of England. Roy's birthplace near [[Carluke]] in [[South Lanarkshire]] is today marked by a memorial in the form of a large OS trig point.&lt;ref&gt;OSGR NS 826497&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1791 the Board received the newer [[Ramsden theodolite]] (an improved successor to the one that Roy had used in 1784), and work began on mapping southern Great Britain using a five-mile baseline on [[Hounslow Heath]] that Roy himself had previously measured; it crosses the present [[Heathrow Airport]]. In 1991 [[Royal Mail]] marked the bicentenary by issuing a set of postage stamps featuring maps of the Kentish village of [[Hamstreet]].

In 1801 the first one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360 scale) map was published, detailing the county of [[Kent]], with [[Essex]] following shortly afterwards. The Kent map was published privately and stopped at the county border, while the Essex maps were published by Ordnance Survey and ignore the county border, setting the trend for future Ordnance Survey maps.{{sfn|Hindle|1998|p=117}}

In the next 20 years about a third of England and Wales was mapped at the same scale (see [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]]) under the direction of [[William Mudge]], as other military matters took precedence. It took until 1823 to re-establish a relationship with the French survey made by Roy in 1787. By 1810 one inch to the mile maps of most of the south of England were completed, but they were withdrawn from sale between 1811 and 1816 because of security fears.&lt;ref&gt;

It was hard work: Major [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]], the longest-serving Director General of Ordnance Survey, walked {{convert|586|mi}} in 22 days on a reconnaissance in 1819. In 1824, Colby and most of his staff moved to Ireland to work on a six-inches-to-the-mile (1:10,560) valuation survey. The survey of Ireland, county by county, was completed in 1846.{{sfn|Hindle|1998|p=114}} The suspicions and tensions it caused in rural Ireland are the subject of [[Brian Friel]]'s play ''[[Translations]]''.

Colby was not only involved in the design of specialist measuring equipment. He also established a systematic collection of place names, and reorganised the map-making process to produce clear, accurate plans. Place names were recorded in "Name Books",&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam&gt;{{cite book |last1=Owen |first1=Tim |last2=Pilbeam |first2=Elaine |year=1992 |title=Ordnance Survey – Map Makers to Britain Since 1791 |place=Southampton |publisher=Ordnance Survey |isbn=0-31-900249-7 |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}} Freely available online at the [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/map-makers-to-britain-since-1791/index.html Ordnance Survew, Owen and Pilbeam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/os/6inch/os_info3.html Ordnance Survey Maps Six-inch, 1st edition, Scotland, 1843-1882 - National Library of Scotland]. maps.nls.uk. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a system first used in Ireland. The instructions for their use were:

{{quote|The persons employed on the survey are to endeavour to obtain the correct orthography of the names of places by diligently consulting the best authorities within their reach. The name of each place is to be inserted as it is commonly spelt, in the first column of the name book and the various modes of spelling it used in books, writings &amp;c. are to be inserted in the second column, with the authority placed in the third column opposite to each.}}

Whilst these procedures generally produced excellent results, mistakes were made: for instance, the Pilgrims Way in the [[North Downs]] labelled the wrong route, but the name stuck. Similarly, the spelling of [[Scafell]] and [[Scafell Pike]] copied an error on an earlier map,&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile reprint, ''Thomas Donald Historic Map of Cumberland 1774'', {{ISBN|9781873124369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was retained as this was the name of a corner of one of the Principal Triangles, despite "Scawfell" being the almost universal form at the time.

Colby believed in leading from the front, travelling with his men, helping to build camps and, as each survey session drew to a close, arranging mountain-top parties with enormous [[plum pudding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html Our history | About].

The [[British Geological Survey]] was founded in 1835 as the Ordnance Geological Survey under [[Henry De la Beche]], and remained a branch of the Ordnance Survey until 1965. At the same time the uneven quality of the English and Scottish maps was being improved by engravers under [[Benjamin Baker (engraver)|Benjamin Baker]]. By the time Colby retired in 1846, the production of six-inch maps of Ireland was complete. This had led to a demand for similar treatment in England, and work was proceeding on extending the six-inch map to northern England, but only a three-inch scale for most of Scotland.

When Colby retired he recommended [[William Yolland]] as his successor, but he was considered too young and the less experienced Lewis Alexander Hall was appointed.&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam/&gt; After a fire in the [[Tower of London]], the headquarters of the survey was moved to [[Ordnance Survey buildings, Southampton|Southampton]], and Yolland was put in charge, but Hall sent him off to Ireland so that when Hall left in 1854 Yolland was again passed over in favour of Major [[Henry James (British Army officer)|Henry James]]. Hall was enthusiastic about extending the survey of the north of England to a scale of 1:2,500. In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished and the Ordnance Survey was placed under the [[War Office]] together with the Topographical Survey and the Depot of Military Knowledge. Eventually in 1870 it was transferred to the [[Office of Works]].

The primary triangulation of the United Kingdom of Roy, Mudge and Yolland was completed by 1841, but was greatly improved by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]] who completed a new survey based on [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]]'s spheroid in 1858, completing the [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain|Principal Triangulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Seymour |1980 |p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he completed an initial [[levelling]] of the country.

After the Ordnance Survey published its [[Ordnance Survey Ireland#History|first large-scale maps of Ireland]] in the mid-1830s, the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]] led to calls for a similar six-inch to the mile survey in England and [[Wales]]. Official procrastination followed, but the development of the railways added to pressure that resulted in the [[Ordnance Survey Act 1841]]. This granted a right to enter property for the purpose of the survey. Following a fire at its headquarters at the [[Tower of London]] in 1841&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618055617/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |archivedate=18 June 2008 |title=Key dates |publisher=London Fire Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in [[Southampton]] and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use. Major-General Sir [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily. He developed and exploited [[photozincography]], not only to reduce the costs of map production but also to publish [[facsimile]]s of nationally important manuscripts. Between 1861 and 1864, a facsimile of the [[Domesday Book]] was issued, [[Ancient counties of England|county]] by county; and a facsimile of the [[Gough Map]] was issued in 1870.

From the 1840s, the Ordnance Survey concentrated on the Great Britain "[[Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series|County Series]]", modelled on the earlier Ireland survey. A start was made on mapping the whole country, county by county, at six inches to the mile (1:10,560). In 1854, "twenty-five inch" maps were introduced with a scale of 1:2500 (25.344&amp;nbsp;inches to the mile) and the six inch maps were then based on these twenty-five inch maps. The first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s, with a second edition completed in the 1890s and 1900s. From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or "second revision") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three times.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;{{harvnb|Oliver|2005|p=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Richard |last2=Hellyer |first2=Roger |year=2002 |title=Ordnance Survey of Great Britain: Indexes to the 1:2500 and six-inch scales |place=Newtown, Montgomeryshire |publisher=David Archer |isbn= |page=}}{{page needed |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, publication of the one-inch to the mile series for Great Britain was completed in 1891.

From the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many "restricted" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for [[War Office]] purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps. Apart from a brief period during the disarmament talks of the 1930s, these areas were left blank or incomplete on standard maps. The War Department 1:2500s, unlike the standard issue, were [[Contour line|contoured]]. The de-classified sheets have now been deposited in some of the Copyright Libraries, helping to complete the map-picture of pre-Second World War Britain.

==City and town mapping, 19th and early 20th century ==
From 1824, the OS began a 6 inch (1:10,560) survey of Ireland for taxation purposes but found this to be inadequate for urban areas and adopted the five-foot scale (1:1056) for Irish cities and towns.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=201}} From 1840, the six-inch standard was adopted in Great Britain for the un-surveyed northern counties and the 1:1056 scale also began to be adopted for urban surveys.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=201}} Between 1842 and 1895, [[Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series#Ordnance Survey Town Plans|some 400 towns]] were mapped at 1:500 (126 inches), 1:528 (120 inches, "10 foot scale") or 1:1056 (60 inches), with the remaining towns mapped at 1:2500 (~25 inches).{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=14}}  In 1855, the Treasury authorised funding for 1:2500 for rural areas and 1:500 for urban areas.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=217}} The 1:500 scale was considered more 'rational' than 1:528 and became known as the "sanitary scale" since its primary purpose was to support establishment of mains sewerage and water supply.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=217}} However, a review of the Ordnance Survey in 1892 found that sales of the 1:500 series maps were very poor and the Treasury declined to fund their continuing maintenance, declaring that any revision or new mapping at this scale must be self-financing.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=221}}  Very few towns and cities saw a second edition of the town plans:{{sfn|Hindle|1998|pp=131-132}} by 1909 only fourteen places had paid for updates.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=220,221}} The review determined that revision of 1:2500 mapping should proceed apace.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=220}} 

The most detailed mapping of London was the OS's 1:1056 survey between 1862 and 1872, which took 326 sheets to cover the capital;{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=42}} a second edition (that needed 759 sheets due to urban expansion) was completed and brought out between 1891 and 1895.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=42}} London was unusual in that [[land registration]] on transfer of title was made compulsory there in 1900.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}} The 1:1056 sheets were partially revised to provide a basis for [[HM Land Registry]] index maps and the OS mapped the whole London County Council area (at 1:1056) at national expense.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}}

From 1911 onwards{{spaced ndash}}and mainly between 1911 and 1913{{spaced ndash}}the Ordnance Survey [[Enlarger|photo-enlarged]] many 1:2500 sheets covering built-up areas to 1:1250 (50.688&amp;nbsp;inches to the mile) for Land Valuation and Inland Revenue purposes: the increased scale was to provide space for annotations.{{sfn|Main|Oliver|2015|p=222}} About a quarter of these 1:1250s were marked "Partially revised 1912/13". In areas where there were no further 1:2500s, these partially revised "fifty inch" sheets represent the last large-scale revision (larger than six-inch) of the County Series. The County Series mapping was superseded by the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] 1:1250s, 1:2500s and 1:10,560s after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Oliver/&gt;

During World War I, the Ordnance Survey was involved in preparing maps of [[Geography of France|France]] and [[Geography of Belgium|Belgium]]. During World War II, many more maps were created, including:
* 1:40,000 map of [[Antwerp]], Belgium
* 1:100,000 map of [[Brussels]], Belgium
* 1:5,000,000 map of [[Geography of South Africa|South Africa]]
* 1:250,000 map of [[Geography of Italy|Italy]]
* 1:50,000 map of north-east France
* 1:30,000 map of the Netherlands with manuscript outline of districts occupied by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].

After the war, Colonel [[Charles Close]], then Director General, developed a strategy using covers designed by Ellis Martin to increase sales in the leisure market. In 1920 [[O. G. S. Crawford]] was appointed Archaeology Officer and played a prominent role in developing the use of aerial photography to deepen understanding of archaeology.

In 1935, the [[J. C. C. Davidson|Davidson]] Committee was established to review the Ordnance Survey's future. The new Director General, Major-General [[Malcolm MacLeod (scientist)|Malcolm MacLeod]], started the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]], an immense task involving the erection of concrete [[Triangulation station|triangulation pillars ("trig points")]] on prominent hilltops as infallible positions for theodolites. Each measurement made by theodolite during the retriangulation was repeated no fewer than 32 times.

The Davidson Committee's final report set the Ordnance Survey on course for the 20th century. The metric [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|national grid reference system]] was launched and a 1:25000-scale series of maps was introduced. The one-inch maps continued to be produced until the 1970s, when they were superseded by the 1:50000-scale series{{spaced ndash}}as proposed by William Roy more than two centuries earlier.

Ordnance Survey had outgrown its site in the centre of Southampton (made worse by the bomb damage of the Second World War). The bombing during the [[Southampton Blitz|Blitz]] devastated Southampton in November 1940 and destroyed most of [[Ordnance Survey buildings, Southampton|Ordnance Survey's city centre offices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mapping the Southampton Blitz 70 years on |url= http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/11/mapping-the-southampton-blitz-70-years-on/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Southampton Blitz: Ordnance Survey map of bomb sites |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/hampshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9232000/9232001.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff were dispersed to other buildings and to temporary accommodation at Chessington and Esher, Surrey, where they produced 1:25000 scale maps of France, Italy, Germany and most of the rest of Europe in preparation for [[Invasion of Normandy|its invasion]]. Until 1969, Ordnance Survey largely remained at its Southampton city centre HQ and at temporary buildings in the suburb of [[Maybush]] nearby, when a new purpose-built headquarters was opened in Maybush adjacent to the wartime temporary buildings there. Some of the remaining buildings of the original Southampton city-centre site are now used as part of the city's court complex.

The new head office building was designed by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Public Buildings and Works]] for 4000 staff, including many new recruits who were taken on in the late 1960s and early 70s as draughtsmen and surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The buildings originally contained factory-floor space for photographic processes such as [[heliozincography]] and map printing, as well as large buildings for storing flat maps. Above the industrial areas are extensive office areas. The complex is notable for its concrete mural by sculptor Keith McCarter and the concrete elliptical paraboloid shell roof over the staff restaurant building.

In 1995, Ordnance Survey digitised the last of about 230,000 maps, making the United Kingdom the first country in the world to complete a programme of large-scale electronic mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html |title=Our history |website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |language=en-gb |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the agency was designated a [[Trading Fund]], required to cover its costs by charging for its products and to remit a proportion of its profits to the Treasury. Officially, it is now a civilian organisation with [[executive agency]] status.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

By the late 1990s technological developments had eliminated the need for vast areas for storing maps and for making printing plates by hand. Although there was a small computer section at Ordnance Survey in the 1960s, the digitising programme had replaced the need for printing large-scale maps, while [[computer-to-plate]] technology (in the form of a single machine) had also rendered the photographic platemaking areas obsolete. Part of the latter was converted into a new conference centre in 2000, which was used for internal events and also made available for external organisations to hire.

In 2010, OS announced that printing and warehouse operations were to be outsourced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html |title=Our history |website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |language=en-gb |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending over 200 years of in-house printing.&lt;ref name="PrintWeek 6 September 2010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Helen |title=BT&amp;D awarded map contract as Ordnance Survey bows out of print |url= http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1128411/bt-awarded-map-contract-ordnance-survey-bows-print |date=6 September 2010 |work=[[PrintWeek]] |accessdate= 9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frome-based firm Butler, Tanner and Dennis (BT&amp;D) secured its printing contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-11183624 |title=Frome company secures OS map contract |date=6 September 2010 |newspaper=BBC News |language=en-GB |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As already stated, large-scale maps had not been printed at Ordnance Survey since the common availability of [[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s (GISs), but, until late 2010, the ''OS Explorer'' and ''OS Landranger'' series were printed in Maybush.

In April 2009 building began of a new head office in Adanac Park on the outskirts of Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey breaks ground at Adanac Park |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=3 April 2009 |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2009/groundbreaking.html |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10 February 2011 virtually all staff had relocated to the new "Explorer House" building and the old site had been sold off and redeveloped. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] officially opened the new headquarters building on 4 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duke opens new Ordnance Survey head office |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/news/2011/10/duke-opens-new-ordnance-survey-building.html |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=21 June 2012 |date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2015 plans were announced for the organisation to move from a Trading Fund model to a government-owned [[limited company]], with the move completed in April 2015. The organisation remains fully owned by the UK government and retains many of the features of a public organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey set to become a Government owned company |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=22 January 2015 |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/os-set-to-become-government-owned-company.html |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey Change in Operating Model |publisher=UK Parliament |date=22 January 2015 |url= http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-01-22/HCWS215/ |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2015 a new [[CEO]] was announced to replace [[Vanessa Lawrence]], who had left in 2014. [[Nigel Clifford]], CEO of [[Procserve Holdings]] Ltd, was appointed by Business Minister [[Matthew Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Minister Matthe Hancock announces the appointment of Nigel Clifford as the new Chief Executive of Ordnance Survey |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/business-minister-announces-new-os-ceo.html |website=ordnancesurvey.co.uk |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the history of the Ordnance Survey was the subject of a [[BBC Four]] TV documentary entitled ''A Very British Map: The Ordnance Survey Story''.&lt;ref name="BBC Timeshift Series 15 Episode 2"&gt;{{cite episode |title= A Very British Map: The Ordnance Survey Story |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06b36q3 |series=Timeshift |station=[[BBC Four]] |airdate= 9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordnance Survey produces a large range of paper maps and [[digital mapping]] products.

===Business mapping===
Ordnance Survey produces a wide variety of different products aimed at business users, such as utility companies and local authorities. The data is supplied by Ordnance Survey on optical media or increasingly, via the Internet. Products can be downloaded via FTP or accessed 'on demand' via a web browser. Organisations using Ordnance Survey data have to purchase a licence to do so. Some of the main products are:

; ''OS MasterMap'' : (see [[#OS MasterMap|below]]) Ordnance Survey's most detailed mapping showing individual buildings and other features in a [[Vector graphics|vector format]]. Every real-world object is assigned a unique reference number (TOID) that allows customers to add this reference to their own databases. ''OS MasterMap'' consists of several so-called "layers" (see [[#OS MasterMap layers|below]]) such as the aerial imagery, transport and postcode. The principal layer is the topographic layer.
; ''OS VectorMap Local'' : A customisable vector product at 1:10,000 scale.
; ''OS Landplan'' : a [[Raster graphics|raster]] map at 1:10 000 scale.
; ''Meridian 2'', ''Strategi'' : Mid-scale mapping in vector format.
; ''ADDRESS-POINT'', ''Code-Point'' : A joint venture with [[Royal Mail]] producing [[dataset]]s with address information to allow postcode searches, etc.
; ''Boundary-Line'' : Mapping showing administrative boundaries such as counties, parishes and [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]].
; 1:10,000, 1:25,000, 1:50,000, 1:250,000 scale raster : Raster versions of leisure maps.
; ''OS Street View'' : A highly simplified mapping focusing on streets and their names at the expense of other features.
; ''Land-Form PROFILE'', ''PROFILE Plus'', ''Panorama'' : [[Digital elevation model|Digital terrain model]]s.

===Leisure maps===
[[File:Ordnance Survey National Grid.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of the Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinate system, with Trafalgar Square as an example]]
OS's range of leisure maps are published in a variety of scales:

; ''Tour'' {{nobold|{{smaller|([[Circa|c.]] 1:100,000, except Scotland)}}}} : One-sheet maps covering a generally county-sized area, showing major and most minor roads and containing tourist information and selected footpaths. ''Tour'' maps are generally produced from enlargements of 1:250,000 mapping. Several larger scale town maps are provided on each sheet for major settlement centres. The maps have sky-blue covers and there are eight sheets in the series.
; ''OS Landranger'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:50,000)}}}} : The "general purpose" map. They have pink covers; 204 sheets cover the whole of Great Britain and the [[Isle of Man]]. The map shows all footpaths and the format is similar to the ''Explorer'' maps, but with less detail.
; ''OS Landranger Active'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:50,000)}}}} : Select ''OS Landranger'' maps available in a plastic-[[Lamination|laminated]] waterproof version, similar to the ''OS Explorer Active'' range. {{As of|2009|10}}, 25 of the 204 ''Landranger'' maps were available as ''OS Landranger Active'' maps.
; ''OS Explorer'', {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:25,000)}}}} : Specifically designed for walkers and cyclists. They have orange covers, and contain 403 sheets covering the whole of Great Britain (the Isle of Man is excluded from this series). These are the most detailed leisure maps that Ordnance Survey publish and cover all types of footpaths and most details of the countryside for easy navigation. The ''OL'' branded sheets within the Explorer series show areas of greater interest in England and Wales (such as the [[Lake District]], the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], etc.) with an enlarged area coverage. They appear identical to the ordinary ''Explorer'' maps, except for the numbering and a little yellow mark on the corner (a relic of the old ''Outdoor Leisure'' series). The ''OS Explorer'' maps, together with the former ''Outdoor Leisure'' series, superseded the numerous green-covered ''Pathfinder'' maps. In May 2015 Ordnance Survey announced that the new release of OL series maps would come with a mobile download version, available through a dedicated app on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey maps undergo their greatest innovation for over 200 years |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2015/os-maps-undergo-greatest-innovation-in-200-years.html |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that this will be rolled out to all the Explorer and Landranger series over time. 
; ''OS Explorer Active'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:25,000 scale)}}}} : ''OS Explorer'' and ''Outdoor Leisure'' maps in a plastic-laminated waterproof version.
; ''Activity Maps'' : An experimental range of maps designed to support specific activities. The four map packs currently published are ''Off-Road Cycling Hampshire'' North, South, East and West. Each map pack contains 12 cycle routes printed on individual map sheets on waterproof paper. While they are based on the 1:25,000 scale maps, the scales have been adjusted so each route fits on a single A4 sheet.

Until 2010, OS also produced the following:
; ''Route'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:625,000)}}}} : A double-sided map designed for long-distance road users, covering the whole of Great Britain.
; ''Road'' {{nobold|{{smaller|(1:250,000)}}}} : A series of eight sheets covering Great Britain, designed for road users.
These, along with fifteen ''Tour'' maps, were discontinued during January 2010 as part of a drive for cost-efficiency.

The ''Road'' series was reintroduced in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/maps.html?cat%5B0%5D=20&amp;cat%5B1%5D=138 |title=Maps |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===App development===
In 2013, Ordnance Survey released its first official app, OS MapFinder, and has since added three more apps.

; ''OS Maps'' : Available on iOS and Android, the free to download app allows users to access maps direct to their devices, plan and record routes and share routes with others. Users can subscribe and download OS Landranger and OS Explorer high-resolution maps in 660dpi quality and use them without incurring roaming charges as maps are stored on the device and can be used offline – without WiFi or mobile signal.
; ''OS Maps Web'': Available as a web page – it allows users to access maps from the web using modern web browsers, planning of custom routes and printing of maps is possible similarly to what the mobile applications can do
; ''OS Locate'' : Launched in February 2014 and available on iOS and Android, the free app is a fast and highly accurate means of pinpointing a users exact location and displays grid reference,  latitude, longitude and altitude. OS Locate does not need a mobile signal to function, so the inbuilt GPS system in a device can be relied upon.
; ''OS Ride'' : Launched in 2014 on iOS, the free app uses Ordnance Survey's detailed outdoor mapping including OS Landranger Maps (1:50 000 scale) enabling cyclists to successfully navigate and track their progress as they ride the pre-loaded routes and follow in the tracks of the 2014 Grand Depart professional cyclists.

===Custom products===
Ordnance Survey also offers ''OS Custom Made'', a [[print-on-demand]] service based on digital raster data that allows a customer to specify the area of the map or maps desired. Two scales are offered{{spaced ndash}}1:50,000 (equivalent to 40&amp;nbsp;km by 40&amp;nbsp;km) or 1:25,000 (20&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km){{spaced ndash}}and the maps may be produced either folded or flat for framing or wall mounting. Customers may provide their own titles and cover images for folded maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Custom Made |url= https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/custom-made-maps.html |work=Ordnance Survey |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordnance Survey also produces more detailed custom mapping to order, at 1:10,000 (''Landplan'') and at 1:1,250 or 1:500 (''Siteplan''), from its large-scale digital data. Custom scales may also be produced from the enlargement or reduction of the existing scales.

===Educational mapping===
Ordnance Survey supplies reproductions of its maps from the early 1970s to the 1990s for educational use. These are widely seen in schools both in Britain and in [[Changes in British sovereignty|former British colonies]], either as stand-alone geographic aids or as part of geography textbooks or workbooks.

During the 2000s, in an attempt to increase schoolchildren's awareness of maps, Ordnance Survey offered a free ''OS Explorer Map'' to every 11-year-old in [[Primary education#United Kingdom|UK primary education]]. By the end of 2010, when the scheme closed, over 6 million maps had been given away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2010/freemaps.html Schools urged to order free maps now! | About]. Ordnance Survey. Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was replaced by free access to the [http://digimapforschools.edina.ac.uk/ Digimap for Schools] service provided by [[EDINA]] for eligible schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/09/large-scale-maps-become-child%E2%80%99s-play-with-digimap-for-schools/ ] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001012153/http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2010/09/large-scale-maps-become-child%E2%80%99s-play-with-digimap-for-schools/ |date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the trend away from paper products towards geographical information systems (GISs), Ordnance Survey has been looking into ways of ensuring schoolchildren are made aware of the benefits of GISs and has launched "MapZone", an interactive child-orientated website featuring learning resources and map-related games.

Ordnance Survey publishes a quarterly journal, principally for geography teachers, called ''Mapping News''.

===Derivative and licensed products===
One series of historic maps, published by [[Cassini Publishing Ltd]], is a reprint of the Ordnance Survey first series from the mid-19th century but using the ''OS Landranger'' [[Map projection|projection]] at 1:50,000 and given 1&amp;nbsp;km gridlines. This means that features from over 150 years ago fit almost exactly over their modern equivalents and modern grid references can be given to old features.

The digitisation of the data has allowed Ordnance Survey to sell maps electronically. Several companies are now licensed to produce the popular scales (1:50,000 and 1:25,000) and their own derived datasets of the map on CD/DVD or to make them available online for download. The buyer typically has the right to view the maps on a PC, a laptop, and a pocket PC/smartphone, and to print off any number of copies. The accompanying software is GPS-aware, and the maps are ready-calibrated. Thus, the user can quickly transfer the desired area from their PC to their laptop or smartphone, and go for a drive or walk with their position continually pinpointed on the screen. The individual map is more expensive than the equivalent paper version, but the price per square km falls rapidly with the size of coverage bought.

==Cartography==
[[File:National Grid for Great Britain.png|thumb|The Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain use the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]]]]
{{main article|Ordnance Survey National Grid}}

The Ordnance Survey's original maps were made by [[triangulation]]. For the second survey, in 1934, this process was used again and resulted in the building of many triangulation pillars ([[trig point]]s): short (c. 4 feet/1.2&amp;nbsp;m high), usually square, concrete or stone pillars at prominent locations such as hill tops. Their precise locations were determined by triangulation, and the details in between were then filled in with less precise methods.

Modern Ordnance Survey maps are largely based on [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]], but large numbers of the pillars remain, many of them adopted by private land owners. Ordnance Survey still has a team of surveyors across Great Britain who visit in person and survey areas that cannot be surveyed using photogrammetric methods (such as land obscured by vegetation) and there is an aim of ensuring that any major feature (such as a new motorway or large housing development) is surveyed within six months of being built. While original survey methods were largely manual, the current surveying task is simplified by the use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology, allowing the most precise surveying standards yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Surveying guidelines |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/navigation-technology/os-net/surveying.html |work=Business &amp; government |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordnance Survey is responsible for a UK-wide network of GPS stations known as "OS Net". These are used for surveying and other organisations can purchase the right to utilise the network for their own uses.

Ordnance Survey still maintains a set of master [[Geodesy|geodetic]] reference points to tie the Ordnance Survey [[Geodetic datum|geographic datum points]] to modern measurement systems such as GPS. Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain use the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] rather than [[Geographic coordinate system#Geographic latitude and longitude|latitude and longitude]] to indicate position. The Grid is known technically as [[OSGB36]] (Ordnance Survey Great Britain 1936) and was introduced after the 1936–1953 retriangulation.

Whereas cartography is the art and science of mapmaking, cartographic design concerns the map user. It governs the design of a map and it is the cartography that ensures the intended message is delivered both efficiently and aesthetically.{{Clarify|date=May 2017|reason=surely the design, not cartography, delivers the message? Source for this opinion?}}

Ordnance Survey's CartoDesign team performs a key role in the organisation, as the authority for cartographic design and development, and engages with internal and external audiences to promote and communicate the value of cartography. They work on a broad range of projects and are responsible for styling all new products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carto Design team |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/resources/carto-design/index.html |work=Business &amp; government |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''OS MasterMap''==
Ordnance Survey's flagship digital product, launched in November 2001, is ''[[OS MasterMap]]'', a database that records, in one continuous digital map, every fixed feature of Great Britain larger than a few metres. Every feature is given a unique [[TOID]] (TOpographical IDentifier), a simple identifier that includes no semantic information. Typically, each TOID is [[Polygon mesh|associated with a polygon that represents the area]] on the ground that the feature covers, in [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|National Grid]] coordinates.

===''OS MasterMap'' layers===
OS MasterMap is offered in themed layers, each linked to a number of TOIDs. As of September 2010, the layers are:

; Topography : The primary layer of ''OS MasterMap'', consisting of vector data comprising large-scale representation of features in the real world, such as buildings and areas of vegetation. The features captured and the way they are depicted is listed in a specification available on the Ordnance Survey website.
; Integrated transport network : A link-and-node network of transport features such as roads and railways. This data is at the heart of many [[Satellite navigation|satnav]] systems. In an attempt to reduce the number of [[Heavy goods vehicle|HGV]]s using unsuitable roads, a data-capture programme of "Road Routing Information" was recently{{when|date=January 2014}} undertaken, aiming to add information such as height restrictions and one-way streets.
; Imagery : [[Orthophoto|Orthorectified aerial photography]] in raster format.
; Address : An overlay adding every address in the UK to other layers.
; Address 2 : Adds further information to the Address layer, such as addresses with multiple occupants (blocks of flats, student houses, etc.) and objects with no postal addresses, such as fields and electricity substations.

Pricing of licenses to ''OS MasterMap'' data depends on the total area requested, the layers licensed, the number of TOIDs in the layers, and the period in years of the data usage. ''OS MasterMap'' can be used to generate maps for a vast array of purposes and maps can be printed from ''OS MasterMap'' data with detail equivalent to a traditional 1:1250 scale paper map.

Ordnance Survey states that thanks to continuous review, ''OS MasterMap'' data is never more than six months out of date. The scale and detail of this mapping project is unique.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} By 2009, around 440 million TOIDs had been assigned, and the database stood at 600 gigabytes in size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/public-sector/mapping-agreements/index.html Public sector mapping agreements | Business and government].

Retrieved on 12 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, ''OS MasterMap'' was at version 6; 2010's version 8 includes provision for Urban Paths (an extension of the "integrated transport network" layer) and pre-build address layer. All these versions have a similar [[Geography Markup Language|GML]] schema.

==Geographical information science research==
For several decades Ordnance Survey has had a research department that is active in several areas of geographical information science, including:
* Spatial cognition
* Map generalisation
* Spatial data modelling
* Remote sensing and analysis of remotely sensed data
* Semantics and ontologies

Ordnance Survey actively supports the academic research community through its external research and university liaison team. The research department actively supports MSc and PhD students as well as engaging in collaborative research. Most Ordnance Survey products are available to UK universities that have signed up to the [[Digimap]] agreement and data is also made available for research purposes that advances Ordnance Survey's own research agenda.

==Data access and criticisms==
{{see also|Open Data in the UK}}

Ordnance Survey has been subject to criticism. Most centres on the point that Ordnance Survey possesses a virtual government monopoly on geographic data in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1726229,00.html |last1=Arthur |first1=Charles |last2=Cross |first2=Michael |title=Give us back our crown jewels |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2006 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, although a government agency, it has been required to act as a [[Trading Fund]] (i.e. a commercial entity) from 1999 to 2015. This meant that it is supposed to be entirely self-funded from the commercial sale of its data and derived products whilst at the same time the public supplier of geographical information. In 1985, the Committee of Enquiry into the Handling of Geographic Information was set up to "advise the Secretary of State for the Environment within two years on the future handling of geographic information in the UK, taking account of modern developments in information technology and market needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chorley |first=RRE |authorlink=Roger Chorley, 2nd Baron Chorley |year=1987 |title=Handling Geographic Information.

In response to the feedback from a consultation,{{which|date=January 2014}} the government announced&lt;ref name="OSA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconresponse |archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconresponse |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 19 September 2012 |title= Policy options for geographic information from Ordnance Survey: Consultation – Government Response |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a package of Ordnance Survey data sets would be released for free use and re-use. On 1 April 2010 Ordnance Survey released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2010/OpenData.html |title=Ordnance Survey launches OS OpenData in groundbreaking national initiative |publisher=Ordnance Survey |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brand ''[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html OS OpenData]'' under an attribution-only license compatible with [[Creative Commons license|CC-by]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf |title=OpenData License Terms and Conditions |publisher=Ordnance Survey |format=PDF |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups and individuals had campaigned for this release of data, but some were disappointed when some of the profitable datasets, including the leisure 1:50,000 scale and 1:25,000 scale mapping, as well as the low scale Mastermap were not included. These were withheld with the counter-argument that if licensees do not pay for OS data collection then the government would have to be willing to foot a £30 million per annum bill to obtain the future economic benefit of sharing the mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data |title=The Ordnance Survey has opened up its map data for free after a long campaign.

In mid-2013 Ordnance Survey described an "enhanced" [[Linked data|linked-data]] service with a [[SPARQL]] 1.1-compliant endpoint and bulk-download options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Ordnance Survey Linked Data service proving popular with developers |url= http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/new-ordnance-survey-linked-data-service-proving-popular-with-developers/340085 |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013 |publisher=Ordnance Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, following the recommendations of the [[Geospatial Commission]] it was announced that parts of OS Mastermap would be released under the [[Open Government Licence]] would include:
* OS MasterMap Topography Layer, including building heights and functional sites
* OS MasterMap Greenspace Layer
* OS MasterMap Highways Network
* OS MasterMap Water Network Layer
* OS Detailed Path Network

However, these would only be free within a usage threshold that was yet to be defined at the release of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unlocking of Government’s mapping and location data to boost economy by £130m a year |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2018/mastermap-announcement.html |website=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical material===
Ordnance Survey historical works are generally available, as the agency is covered by [[Crown Copyright]]: works more than fifty years old, including historic surveys of Britain and Ireland and much of the New Popular Edition, are in the public domain. However, finding suitable originals remains an issue as Ordnance Survey does not provide historical mapping on 'free' terms, instead marketing commercially 'enhanced' reproductions in partnership with companies including GroundSure and Landmark.

The [[National Library of Scotland]] has been developing its archive to make Ordnance Survey maps for all of Great Britain more easily available through their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ordnance Survey Maps |url= http://maps.nls.uk/os/ |publisher=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sets are complete in the sense of including at least one copy of each of the sheets in the series, not in the sense of including all revision levels.

The UK approach can be contrasted with, for example, that in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in more recent times, where [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] claims regular copyright over its mapping (and over digital copies of the public domain historical mapping). All Ordnance Survey Ireland maps (historic and current) are available free to view on their online website.

In [[Cultural ecology]] [[Marshall Sahlins]] used this concept in order to develop alternative approaches to the [[environmental determinism]] dominant at that time in ecological studies. Theory by [[Strabo]] in 64 BC that humans can make things happen by their own intelligence over time. Strabo cautioned against the assumption that nature and actions of  humans were determined by the physical environment they inhabited. He observed that humans were the active elements in a human-environmental partnership.

The controversy between geographical ''possibilism'' and ''determinism'' might be considered as one of (at least) three dominant [[epistemologic]] controversies of contemporary geography. The other two controversies are 1) the "debate between neopositivists and neokantians about the "exceptionalism" or the specificity of geography as a science [and 2)] the contention between [[Halford Mackinder|Mackinder]] and [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] about what is—or should be—geography".&lt;ref&gt;[[José William Vesentini]], [http://confins.revues.org/document1162.html ''Controvérsias geográficas: epistemologia e política''], [[Confins (magazine)]] - Revue Franco-Brésilienne de Géographie&lt;/ref&gt;

''Possibilism'' in geography is, thus, considered as a distinct approach to geographical knowledge, directly opposed to geographical ''determinism''.

'''Rankine's method''' is a technique for laying out circular curves by a combination of chaining and angles at circumference, fully exploiting the [[theodolite]] and making a substantial improvement in accuracy and productivity over existing methods. 

Rankine's method is named for its discoverer [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] at an early stage of his career. He had been working on [[railway]]s in [[Ireland]], on the construction of the [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]] line.

The '''retriangulation of Great Britain''' was a [[triangulation]] project carried out between 1935 and 1962 that sought to improve the accuracy of maps made of [[Great Britain]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/overview/history.html|title=Our history|website=www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The retriangulation involved erecting around 6,500 concrete pillars (known as [[Trig point|trig points]]) on British hilltops, which were used as reference points for the triangulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36036561|title=In pictures: Mapping Great Britain|date=2016-04-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, use of the trig points and the results of the retriangulation have been replaced by a network of [[GNSS]] stations known as OS Net, which is able to achieve an accuracy of {{Convert|3|mm|in}} over the length of the country compared to {{Convert|20|m|ft}} achievable by use of the trig points&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/04/happy-birthday-to-the-trig-pillar-75-years-young-today/|title=Happy birthday to the Trig Pillar - 75 years young today|date=2011-04-18|work=Ordnance Survey Blog|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The retriangulation was begun in 1935 by the Director General of the [[Ordnance Survey]], Major-General [[Malcolm MacLeod (scientist)|Malcolm MacLeod]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was directed by the cartographer and mathematician [[Martin Hotine]], head of the Trigonometrical and Levelling Division.

Erecting new trig points and making measurements frequently required materials and instruments to be carried on foot, up hills and mountains and to isolated islands, in all kinds of weather. The network of trig points was built and measured between 1936 and 1962, starting with a set of several hundred primary trig points, most of which were placed on high hills so as to be able to link to one another across long distances. In addition, a larger set of roughly six thousand secondary trig points were added to allow the construction of a finer mesh that extended the reference frame of the primary mesh over shorter distances.

The calculations were constrained; it was hoped to minimise the shifts from the coordinates based on the old triangulation. At eleven primary trig points from [[Dunnose, Isle of Wight|Dunnose]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] (456784 m E, 080150 m N) north to [[Great Whernside]] in Yorkshire (400202 E, 473904 N) the new lat-lons were adjusted to stay within a metre of the old ones. Once the new Latitude and Longitude of those eleven points were fixed the calculated location of every other point in the triangulation was based on them. By the time the retriangulation was completed, [[electronic distance measurement]] devices had come into use which could have greatly reduced the overall error (it now seems Great Britain is 20+ metres shorter than OSGB36 implies&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;) but starting over from scratch was out of the question&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;.

The '''Southern Levant''' is a [[Region|geographical region]] encompassing the southern half of the [[Levant]]. It corresponds approximately to modern-day [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Jordan]]; some definitions also include southern [[Lebanon]], southern [[Syria]] and/or the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. As a strictly geographical description, it is sometimes used by [[archaeologists]] and [[historians]] to avoid the religious and political connotations of other names for the area.

Like much of [[Western Asia|Southwestern Asia]], the Southern Levant is an arid region consisting mostly of [[desert]] and [[dry steppe]], with a thin strip of wetter, [[Temperate climate|temperate]] climate along the Mediterranean coast. Geographically it is dominated by the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]], a section of the [[Great Rift Valley]] bisecting the region from north to south, and containing the [[Sea of Galilee]], the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Dead Sea]] – the lowest point on the earth's land surface.

The Southern Levant has a long history and is one of the areas of the world most intensively investigated by archaeologists. It is considered likely to be the first place that both [[Out of Africa I|early hominins]] and [[Recent African origin of modern humans|modern humans]] colonised outside of Africa. Consequently, it has a rich [[Stone Age]] archaeology, stretching back as early as 1.5 million years ago.

}}The Southern Levant refers to the lower half of the [[Levant]] but there is some variance of geographical definition, with the widest definition including [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[southern Syria]] and the [[Sinai|Sinai Desert]].&lt;ref name="Levy et al 2010"/&gt; In the field of archaeology, the southern Levant is "the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrnsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105|title=Historical Biblical Archaeology and the Future: The New Pragmatism|last=Burke|first=Aaron A.|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781134937530|editor-last=Levy|editor-first=Thomas Evan|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Transformation of Biblical and Syro-Palestinian Archaeology|quote=Much work continues to be done in these regions, and not surprisingly this work is now of great interest to those studying the southern Levant (i.e. the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan) [...] Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan, Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term ‘Syria-Palestine’ has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes ‘Syria-Palestine’. However, the journal Levant has been published since 1969 and since 1990 Ägypten und Levante has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term ‘Levant’ when compared to ‘Syria-Palestine’ for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that ‘Syria-Palestine’ is, correctly speaking, the title for a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term ‘Syria-Palestine’ also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized, therefore, that—for at least the time being—they can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars studying the region's archaeology have adopted the term Levant (including northern and southern halves) as the "term of choice" due to it being a "wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus" that does not have the "political overtones" of Syria-Palestine.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A survey of North American dissertations shows the "overwhelming emphasis and scope of these works has been the southern Levant, an area formerly identified as Syria-Palestine including Canaan", but with most modern Ph.D. dissertations using the terms ‘Israel’ and ‘Canaan’.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The term Southern Levant has also been criticized as imprecise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1993|title=Note éditoriale.|trans-title=Editorial remarks|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1993_num_19_1_4981|journal=Paléorient|volume=19|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|quote=In gathering contributions for the present issue, it soon became apparent - and this is a generally valid point - that imprecise terminology is one of the major difficulties encountered in our research. An example is the term "Southern Levant" used as a substitute for the geographers’ "Palestine". The use of this term hides the particularism of the regions on either side of the Jordan Valley just when the discoveries of the last decade have highlighted their specificity. The lack of precision traditional terminology (agriculture, herding, pastoralism, neolithic, etc.) applied to the complex phenomena that we are studying constantly leads to misunderstandings.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an awkward name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoT6zimQOXMC|title=Towns in Ancient Israel and in the Southern Levant|last=de Geus|first=C.

In Europe we are used to the late Roman name 'Palestine,' and the designation 'Palestinian Archaeology' has a long history. According to Byzantine usage it included CisJordan and TransJordan and even Lebanon and Sinai. In modern times, however, the name 'Palestine' has exclusively become the political designation for a restricted area. Furthermore, in the period this book deals with a region called 'Palestine' did not yet exist. Also the ancient name 'Canaan' cannot be used as it refers to an older period in history. Designations as: 'The Land(s) of the Bible' or 'the Hold Land' evoke the suspicion of a theological bias. 'The Land of Israel' does not apply to the situation because it never included Lebanon or the greater part of modern Jordan. Therefore I have joined those who today advocate the designation 'Southern Levant.'

This small strip of land in the Southern Levant has been occupied by so many, fought over and carved up so many times, that it is hard to know just what to call it. The use of 'Israel' implies to some that all of it belongs today only to the Jews as legitimate descendants of OT Israel. Similarly, 'Palestine' has a longstanding usage, but may imply that all of it belongs to Palestinian Arabs exclusively. Both of these terms could be used strictly for geography. But because of the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both terms also may introduce misunderstanding. And biblical scholars have no universal agreement on this topic. 'Syria-Palestine' is often used, as here, for geographical precision. But it is only the southern portion of Syria-Palestine that was occupied by ancient Israel, and it does not always communicate sufficiently. 'Canaan' is an ancient name, but it also is not exactly conterminous with the land occupied by ancient Israel. I have used 'Southern Levant' occasionally here but admit that this is a strange expression. l will most often refer simply to 'Israel,' by which I mean the territory of national Israel in the OT, but hope the reader will understand no modern political claims by this use.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Southern Levant has been described in academic discourse as a "at least a strictly geographical" description of the region, avoiding religious and political connotations of names such as "Canaan", "Holy Land", "Land of Israel", or "Palestine".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Southern Levant topographic map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Topographic map of the Southern Levant]]

The Southern Levant lies on the [[Eastern Mediterranean|eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea]], in the world region known variously as the [[Near East]], the [[Middle East]] or [[Western Asia|Western or Southwestern Asia]]. It is bordered to the east, southeast and southwest by the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]], [[Arabian Desert|Arabian]] and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] deserts, respectively.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner &amp; Killebrew 2014"/&gt; Some definitions include parts of these deserts in the region.&lt;ref name="Yaker 1998"/&gt; The [[Litani River]] is commonly considered the dividing line between the Southern Levant and the Northern Levant (i.e. [[Syria (region)|Syria]]),&lt;ref name="Yaker 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peregrine &amp; Ember 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner &amp; Killebrew 2014"/&gt; or sometimes the [[Orontes River]], also in central Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2004"/&gt;

For the most part, the climate of the Southern Levant is [[arid]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], however a narrow strip along the coast experiences a [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Mediterranean climate]] due to its proximity to the sea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziv|first=Baruch|last2=Dayan|first2=Uri|last3=Kushnir|first3=Yohanan|last4=Roth|first4=Chaggi|last5=Enzel|first5=Yehouda|date=2006-01-01|title=Regional and global atmospheric patterns governing rainfall in the southern Levant|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1238/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–73|doi=10.1002/joc.1238|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average annual rainfall decreases sharply away from the coast, from over {{convert|1000|mm|abbr=off}} per year in [[Galilee]], to {{convert|200|-|400|mm|abbr=off}} in the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Rift Valley]], and less than {{convert|50|mm|abbr=off}} in the eastern deserts and the [[Negev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziv|first=Baruch|last2=Saaroni|first2=Hadas|last3=Pargament|first3=Roee|last4=Harpaz|first4=Tzvi|last5=Alpert|first5=Pinhas|date=2013-02-22|title=Trends in rainfall regime over Israel, 1975–2010, and their relationship to large-scale variability|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x|journal=Regional Environmental Change|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1751–1764|doi=10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x|issn=1436-3798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the region, precipitation is both highly seasonal―most rain falls between October and May, and hardly any in the summer—and subject to large, unpredictable interannual variation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Temperature is also highly variable, with cool winters and hot summers.

The [[Jordan River]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;bisects much of the region into the [[Cisjordan]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

==Archaeological findings==
{{See also|Prehistory of the Levant|History of the ancient Levant}}

The archaeology of the southern Levant is generally conceived as a series of phases or stages in [[human]] cultural and evolutionary development based, for the most part, on tool technology for early pre-historic, proto-historic and early historic periods. Later phases are generally associated with historical periods and are named accordingly.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} While there is no single, accepted sequence that all archaeologists agree upon, the basic conventions indicate a number of [[Stone Age]]s, followed by a Copper/Stone age, in turn followed by a [[Bronze Age]]. The names given to them, derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]], are also used widely for other regions. The different ages in turn are often divided up into sequential or sometimes parallel chrono-cultural facies, sometimes called “cultures” or “periods”. Sometimes their names are derived from [[History of Europe|European prehistory]], at other times from local sites, often where they were first discovered.

Archaeologically, it is among the most extensively excavated regions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10962261/A_passion_for_cultural_difference._Archaeology_and_ethnicity_in_the_southern_Levant|title=A passion for cultural difference.

===Pre-history and Stone Age===
The Southern Levant is amongst the oldest inhabited parts of Eurasia, being on one of three plausible routes by which early [[Hominini|hominins]] could have [[Out of Africa I|dispersed out of Africa]] (along with the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Bab al Mandab]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fleagle, John G., Shea, John J., Grine, Frederick E., Baden, Andrea L., Leakey, Richard E., "Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia", Springer 2010 pp 247-273.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo erectus]]'' left Africa and became the first hominin species to colonise Europe and Asia approximately two million years ago, probably via the Southern Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbate|first=Ernesto|last2=Sagri|first2=Mario|date=2012-07-26|title=Early to Middle Pleistocene Homo dispersals from Africa to Eurasia: Geological, climatic and environmental constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211001479|journal=Quaternary International|series=The genus Homo from Africa to Europe: evolution of terrestrial ecosystems and dispersal routes|volume=267|pages=3–19|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.02.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolland|first=Nicolas|date=2013-12-06|title=The Early Pleistocene human dispersals in the Circum-Mediterranean Basin and initial peopling of Europe: Single or multiple pathways?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003698|journal=Quaternary International|series=Middle to Upper Palaeolithic biological and cultural shift in Eurasia II|volume=316|pages=59–72|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2013.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase of the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene epoch]] the region was wetter and greener, allowing ''H. erectus'' to find places with fresh water as it followed other African animals that were dispersing out of Africa at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carotenuto|first=F.|last2=Tsikaridze|first2=N.|last3=Rook|first3=L.|last4=Lordkipanidze|first4=D.|last5=Longo|first5=Laura|last6=Condemi|first6=Silvana|last7=Raia|first7=P.|date=2016-06-01|title=Venturing out safely: The biogeography of Homo erectus dispersal out of Africa|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248416000294|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=95|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such location was '[[Ubeidiya]], on the southern shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]], where some of the oldest hominin remains in Eurasia have been discovered, dating to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNuoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|title=World Prehistory and Archaeology|last=Chazan|first=Michael|date=2015-10-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317347514|location=|pages=82|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez-Navarro|first=Bienvenido|last2=Belmaker|first2=Miriam|last3=Bar-Yosef|first3=Ofer|date=2009-05-01|title=The large carnivores from ‘Ubeidiya (early Pleistocene, Israel): biochronological and biogeographical implications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248409000256|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=56|issue=5|pages=514–524|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[stone age]]s, when stone tools prevailed and make up the bulk of artifacts, are followed by periods when other technologies came into use. They lent their names to the different periods. The basic framework for the southern [[Levant]] is, as follows:  [[Paleolithic]] or Old Stone Age is often divided up into phases called, from early-to-late: [[Lower Paleolithic]], Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic. An [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipaleolithic]] (latest Paleolithic) period, also known as [[Mesolithic]] (transition to Neolithic) follows and is, in turn succeeded by a [[Neolithic]] (New Stone Age).

The following '''[[Chalcolithic]] period''' includes the first evidence of [[Nonferrous archaeometallurgy of the Southern Levant|metallurgy]] with copper making its appearance. However, as [[stone technology]] remains prevalent, the name, Chalcolithic (Copper/Stone) age combines the two.

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze]] is used for the following periods, but is actually a misnomer for a good part of that time. An Early [[Bronze Age]] is divided into three major phases, Early Bronze I, II and III, but copper and not bronze was the most common [[metal]] in use, while [[stone technology]] continued to contribute the bulk of [[tool]]s. Early Bronze III is followed by another period, alternately named Early Bronze IV, Middle Bronze I, Intermediate Bronze or Early Bronze-Middle Bronze. In this period the name is apt; true bronze (a [[tin]] [[alloy]] of [[copper]]) makes its appearance in this time span.

The next period is generally known as Middle Bronze II and is generally broken down into two sub-periods, Middle Bronze IIa and Middle Bronze IIb. Some scholars acknowledge a Middle Bronze III. The next period is known as Late Bronze and is often sub-divided into Late Bronze I and II.

===Iron Age===
The introduction of [[iron]], although relatively rare, especially in the earliest phases, caused the following phase to be named the [[Iron Age]]. It is variously sub-divided into Iron I, Iron II and sometimes Iron III, with subdivisions becoming increasingly popular as sequences become better known. Some archaeologists suggest that there in the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, the large cultural differences are explained by foreign invasion, that is, the introduction of new ethnicity. More recent evidence indicates that the large culture changes were not the result of a foreign invasion. Rather, the Iron Age people of the southern Levant were related to their Bronze Age predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullinger|first=Jaime M.|last2=Sheridan|first2=Susan Guise|last3=Hawkey|first3=Diane E.|last4=Turner|first4=Christy G.|last5=Cooley|first5=Robert|date=2005-10-01|title=Bioarchaeological analysis of cultural transition in the southern Levant using dental nonmetric traits|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=128|issue=2|pages=466–476|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20074|issn=0002-9483|pmid=15895418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later historical periods===
The post Iron Age is generally thought of as historical and accordingly names of periods reflect this. The very latest Iron Age phase is sometimes called “[[Assyria]]n” and the following period is universally known as the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] period.

The 333 BC conquest of the region is accepted as the beginning of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] period. The [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical book]] [[2 Maccabees]] records: "Apollonius the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria and Phenicia", Celesyria being the transliteration of [[Coele-Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Maccabees|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by Early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Late Roman periods. The 4th century is recognized as the beginning of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period that lasted until the [[Arab]] conquest of the region.

Later periods are alternately known as Early Arab and sub-periods by the names of reigning dynasties. The [[Crusades|Crusader]] conquest of the region is known, appropriately as the Crusader period and it is followed by a [[Mameluks|Mameluke]] period after the conquering dynasty. In 1517 the [[Ottoman empire]] conquered the region and gave its name to the period that lasted until 1917, when the British conquered it in [[World War I]].

'''Tides''' are the rise and fall of [[sea level]]s caused by the combined effects of the [[gravity|gravitational]] forces exerted by the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]], and the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of [[Earth]].

[[Tide table]]s can be used to find the predicted times and amplitude (or "[[tidal range]]") of tides at any given locale. The predictions are influenced by many factors including the alignment of the Sun and Moon, the [[Tide#Phase and amplitude|phase and amplitude of the tide]] (pattern of tides in the deep ocean), the [[amphidromic]] systems of the oceans, and the shape of the coastline and near-shore [[bathymetry]] (see ''[[Tide#Timing|Timing]]'').  They are however only predictions, the actual time and height of the tide is affected by wind and atmospheric pressure.  Some shorelines experience a [[semi-diurnal]] tide—two nearly equal high and low tides each day. Other locations experience a [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] tide—only one high and low tide each day. A "mixed tide"—two uneven tides a day, or one high and one low—is also possible.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book

Tides vary on timescales ranging from hours to years due to a number of factors, which determine the [[lunitidal interval]]. To make accurate records, [[tide gauge]]s at fixed stations measure water level over time. Gauges ignore variations caused by waves with periods shorter than minutes. These data are compared to the reference (or datum) level usually called [[mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Do not confuse with the astronomical [[lunar day]] on the Moon. A lunar zenith is the Moon's highest point in the sky.&lt;/ref&gt;

While tides are usually the largest source of short-term sea-level fluctuations, sea levels are also subject to forces such as wind and barometric pressure changes, resulting in [[storm surge]]s, especially in shallow seas and near coasts.

Tidal phenomena are not limited to the oceans, but can occur in other systems whenever a gravitational field that varies in time and space is present. For example, the shape of the solid part of the Earth is affected slightly by [[Earth tide]], though this is not as easily seen as the water tidal movements.

The third shows the day-long period of a diurnal tide.]]
Tide changes proceed via the following stages:
* Sea level rises over several hours, covering the [[intertidal zone]]; '''flood tide'''.
* The water rises to its highest level, reaching '''high tide'''.
* Sea level falls over several hours, revealing the intertidal zone; '''ebb tide'''.
* The water stops falling, reaching '''low tide'''.

Oscillating currents produced by tides are known as tidal streams. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called [[slack water]] or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and is said to be turning. '''Slack water''' usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those of high and low water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Tides are commonly ''semi-diurnal'' (two high waters and two low waters each day), or ''diurnal'' (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters on a given day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the ''higher high water'' and the ''lower high water'' in [[tide table]]s. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the ''higher low water'' and the ''lower low water''. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;Tide tables usually list ''mean lower low water'' (mllw, the 19 year average of mean lower low waters), ''mean higher low water'' (mhlw), ''mean lower high water'' (mlhw), ''mean higher high water'' (mhhw), as well as ''perigean tides''. These are ''mean'' values in the sense that they derive from mean data.{{cite web

===Definitions===
From the highest level to the lowest:
* '''Highest astronomical tide''' ('''HAT''') – The highest tide which can be predicted to occur.  Note that meteorological conditions may add extra height to the HAT.
* '''Mean high water springs''' ('''MHWS''') – The average of the two high tides on the days of spring tides.
* '''Mean high water neaps''' ('''MHWN''') – The average of the two high tides on the days of neap tides.
* '''Mean sea level''' ('''MSL''') – This is the average sea level.  The MSL is constant for any location over a long period.
* '''Mean low water neaps''' ('''MLWN''') – The average of the two low tides on the days of neap tides.
* '''Mean low water springs''' ('''MLWS''') – The average of the two low tides on the days of spring tides.
* '''Lowest astronomical tide''' ('''LAT''') and '''Chart Datum''' ('''CD''') – The lowest tide which can be predicted to occur.  Modern charts use this as the chart datum.  Note that under certain meteorological conditions the water may fall lower than this meaning that there is less water than shown on charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of tidal terms|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tidal-intro/definitions|website=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tidal constituents== &lt;!-- [[tidal constituent]] and [[tidal constituents]] redirect here --&gt;

'''Tidal constituents''' are the net result of multiple influences impacting tidal changes over certain periods of time.  Primary constituents include the Earth's rotation, the position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the Moon's altitude (elevation) above the Earth's Equator, and [[bathymetry]].  Variations with periods of less than half a day are called ''harmonic constituents''. Conversely, cycles of days, months, or years are referred to as ''long period'' constituents.

Tidal forces [[Earth tide|affect the entire earth]], but the movement of solid Earth occurs by mere centimeters.  In contrast, the atmosphere is much more fluid and compressible so its surface moves by kilometers, in the sense of the contour level of a particular low pressure in the outer atmosphere.
{{see also|Earth tide#Tidal constituents}}

===Principal lunar semi-diurnal constituent===
In most locations, the largest constituent is the "principal lunar semi-diurnal", also known as the ''M2'' (or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tidal constituent. Its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a ''tidal lunar day'', which is the average time separating one lunar [[zenith]] from the next, and thus is the time required for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. Simple [[tide clock]]s track this constituent. The lunar day is longer than the Earth day because the Moon orbits in the same direction the Earth spins. This is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05½ (not at 1:00).

The Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a day—about 24 hours and 50 minutes—for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead ([[culmination]]) once and underfoot once (at an [[hour angle]] of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to [[zenith]] or [[nadir]], but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.

Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to "stretch" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to "catch up" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

When there are two high tides each day with different heights (and two low tides also of different heights), the pattern is called a ''mixed semi-diurnal tide''.&lt;ref name=noaa7&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Tidal range}}
{{anchor|springtide}}The semi-diurnal range (the difference in height between high and low waters over about half a day) varies in a two-week cycle. Approximately twice a month, around [[new moon]] and [[full moon]] when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a configuration known as a [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The tide's range is then at its maximum; this is called the '''spring tide'''. It is not named after the [[Spring (season)|season]], but, like that word, derives from the meaning "jump, burst forth, rise", as in a natural [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].

When the Moon is at [[Gibbous|first quarter]] or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the '''neap tide''', or '''neaps'''.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "without the power", as in ''forðganges nip'' (forth-going without-the-power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|neap²}} Old English (example given from AD 469: ''forðganges nip'' - without the power of advancing).  The Danish ''niptid'' is probably from the English.  The English term neap-flood (from which neap tide comes) seems to have been in common use by AD 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, '[[slack water]]' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.

===Other constituents===
These include solar gravitational effects, the obliquity (tilt) of the Earth's Equator and rotational axis, the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit and the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit of the Sun.

A compound tide (or overtide) results from the shallow-water interaction of its two parent waves.&lt;ref name="leprovost"&gt;Le Provost, Christian (1991).

&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Map showing relative tidal magnitudes of different ocean areas]]
Because the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tidal constituent dominates in most locations, the stage or ''phase'' of a tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called ''cotidal lines'', which are analogous to [[contour lines]] of constant altitude on [[topographical maps]]. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.

For an ocean in the shape of a circular basin enclosed by a coastline, the ''cotidal lines'' point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the [[amphidromic point]]. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by ''zero'' tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, [[Iceland]] and [[Madagascar]].) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant ''amplitude'' (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation, caused by the [[Coriolis effect]], is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the ''epoch''. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent "equilibrium tide" on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schureman|first=Paul|title=Manual of harmonic analysis and prediction of tides|date=1971|publisher=U.S. Coast and geodetic survey|page=204|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/ia/manualofharmonic00schu#page/220/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North Atlantic, because the cotidal lines circulate counterclockwise around the amphidromic point, the high tide passes New York Harbor approximately an hour ahead of Norfolk Harbor. South of Cape Hatteras the tidal forces are more complex, and cannot be predicted reliably based on the North Atlantic cotidal lines.

===History of tidal physics===
Investigation into tidal physics was important in the early development of [[celestial mechanics]], with the existence of two daily tides being explained by the Moon's gravity. Later the daily tides were explained more precisely by the interaction of the Moon's and the Sun's gravity.

[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] theorized around 150 B.C. that tides were caused by the Moon. The influence of the Moon on bodies of water was also mentioned in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy with Frank E. Robbins, trans., ''Tetrabiblos'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1940), Book 1, chapter 2.  From chapter 2:  "The moon, too, as the heavenly body nearest the earth, bestows her effluence most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her; the rivers increase and diminish their streams with her light, the seas turn their own tides with her rising and setting, … "&lt;/ref&gt;.

In ''De temporum ratione'' (''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'') of 725 [[Bede]] linked semidurnal tides and the phenomenon of varying tidal heights to the Moon and its phases.  Bede starts by noting that the tides rise and fall 4/5 of an hour later each day, just as the Moon rises and sets 4/5 of an hour later.&lt;ref name=Wallis&gt;{{cite book|author=Bede|authorlink=Bede|translator-last=Wallis|translator-first=Faith|title=The Reckoning of Time|year=1999|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=0-85323-693-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=1 June 2018|p=82|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to emphasise that in two lunar months (59 days) the Moon circles the Earth 57 times and there are 114 tides.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=83}}  Bede then observes that the height of a tides varies over the month.  Increasing tides are called ''malinae'' and decreasing tides ''ledones'' and that the month is divided into  four parts of seven or eight days with alternating ''malinae'' and ''ledones''.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=84}}  In the same passage he also notes the effect of winds to hold back tides.{{sfn|Bede|1999|p=84}}

[[Simon Stevin]] in his 1608 ''De spiegheling der Ebbenvloet'', The theory of ebb and flood, dismissed  a large number of misconceptions that still existed about ebb and flood. Stevin pleaded for the idea that the attraction of the Moon was responsible for the tides and spoke in clear terms about ebb, flood, [[spring tide]] and [[neap tide]], stressing that further research needed to be made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/224466.pdf Simon Stevin - Flanders Marine Institute] (pdf, in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmerino, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5lkdlMPi1AC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=%22johannes+kepler%22+%22simon+stevin%22+ebb+flood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YXUszazjTC&amp;sig=_Dh5OmbnwPKfoHfwVpreNLbJxV8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dPKKU5uoKMasPcmdgPgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22johannes%20kepler%22%20%22simon%20stevin%22%20ebb%20flood&amp;f=false The Reception of the Galilean Science of Motion in Seventeenth-Century Europe, pp. 200] op books.google.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609 [[Johannes Kepler]] also correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon caused the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova'' … (1609), p. 5 of the ''Introductio in hoc opus'' (Introduction to this work).  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/n24/mode/1up From page 5:]  ''"Orbis virtutis tractoriæ, quæ est in Luna, porrigitur utque ad Terras, &amp; prolectat aquas sub Zonam Torridam, … Celeriter vero Luna verticem transvolante, cum aquæ tam celeriter sequi non possint, fluxus quidem fit Oceani sub Torrida in Occidentem, … "'' (The sphere of the lifting power, which is [centered] in the moon, is extended as far as to the earth and attracts the waters under the torrid zone, … However the moon flies swiftly across the zenith ; because the waters cannot follow so quickly, the tide of the ocean under the torrid [zone] is indeed made to the west, … )&lt;/ref&gt; which he based upon ancient observations and correlations.

[[Galileo Galilei]] in his 1632 ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', whose working title was ''Dialogue on the Tides'', gave an explanation of the tides. The resulting theory, however, was incorrect as he attributed the tides to the sloshing of water caused by the Earth's movement around the Sun. He hoped to provide mechanical proof of the Earth's movement. The value of his tidal theory is disputed. Galileo rejected Kepler's explanation of the tides.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) was the first person to explain tides as the product of the gravitational attraction of astronomical masses. His explanation of the tides (and many other phenomena) was published in the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1687)&lt;ref name=slc-ch2&gt;

In 1740, the [[Académie Royale des Sciences]] in Paris offered a prize for the best theoretical essay on tides. [[Daniel Bernoulli]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Colin Maclaurin]] and [[Antoine Cavalleri]] shared the prize.&lt;ref name="EulerAiton1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonhard Euler|author2=Eric J.

Maclaurin used Newton's theory to show that a smooth sphere covered by a sufficiently deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a [[prolate]] spheroid (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth's [[Coriolis effect|rotational effects]] on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force's ''horizontal'' component (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.

In 1770 [[James Cook]]'s [[barque]] [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']] grounded on the [[Great Barrier Reef]].  Attempts were made to refloat her on the following tide which failed, but the tide after that lifted her clear with ease.  Whilst she was being repaired in the mouth of the [[Endeavour River]] Cook observed the tides over a period of seven weeks.  At neap tides both tides in a day were similar, but at springs the tides rose {{convert|7|feet}} in the morning but {{convert|9|feet}} in the evening.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal

Pierre-Simon Laplace formulated a system of [[partial differential equation]]s relating the ocean's horizontal flow to its surface height, the first major dynamic theory for water tides. The [[Laplace's tidal equations|Laplace tidal equations]] are still in use today. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], rewrote Laplace's equations in terms of [[vorticity]] which allowed for solutions describing tidally driven coastally trapped waves, known as [[Kelvin wave]]s.&lt;ref name="tidhist"&gt;{{cite journal

===Forces===
The [[tidal force]] produced by a massive object (Moon, hereafter) on a small particle located on or in an extensive body (Earth, hereafter) is the vector difference between the gravitational force exerted by the Moon on the particle, and the gravitational force that would be exerted on the particle if it were located at the Earth's center of mass. 

Whereas the [[gravitational force]] subjected by a celestial body on Earth varies inversely as the square of its distance to the Earth, the maximal tidal force varies inversely as, approximately, the cube of this distance.&lt;ref&gt;Young, C.A. 1889. ''A Textbook of General Astronomy'' [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37275/37275-pdf.pdf] Page 288.&lt;/ref&gt; If the tidal force caused by each body were instead equal to its full gravitational force (which is not the case due to the [[free fall]] of the whole Earth, not only the oceans, towards these bodies) a different pattern of tidal forces would be observed, e.g. with a much stronger influence from the Sun than from the Moon: The solar gravitational force on the Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The solar tidal force is 46% as large as the lunar.&lt;!-- numbers double-checked by User:JEBrown87544, 03 Jan 2007 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961029b.html NASA] the lunar tidal force is 2.21 times larger than the solar.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the Moon–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', while the solar tidal acceleration (along the Sun–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 0.52 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', where ''g'' is the [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration]] at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tidal force#Mathematical treatment|Tidal force – Mathematical treatment]] and sources cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Venus has the largest effect of the other planets, at 0.000113 times the solar effect. The system of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun is an example of a [[three-body problem]], and there is no exact mathematical [[closed-form expression]] of their interdependence.

[[File:Field tidal.svg|thumb|The lunar [[gravity]] differential [[Vector field|field]] at the Earth's surface is known as the [[Tidal force|tide-generating force]]. This is the primary mechanism that drives tidal action and explains two equipotential tidal bulges, accounting for two daily high waters.|alt=Diagram showing a circle with closely spaced arrows pointing away from the reader on the left and right sides, while pointing towards the user on the top and bottom.]]

The ocean's surface is closely approximated by an equipotential surface, (ignoring ocean currents) commonly referred to as the [[geoid]]. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's [[gradient]], there are no [[tangent]]ial forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.

===Laplace's tidal equations===
Ocean depths are much smaller than their horizontal extent. Thus, the response to tidal forcing can be [[Model (abstract)|modelled]] using the [[Laplace's tidal equations|Laplace tidal equations]] which incorporate the following features:

# The vertical (or radial) velocity is negligible, and there is no vertical [[wind shear|shear]]—this is a sheet flow.
# The forcing is only horizontal ([[tangent]]ial).
# The [[Coriolis effect]] appears as an inertial force (fictitious) acting laterally to the direction of flow and proportional to velocity.
# The surface height's rate of change is proportional to the negative divergence of velocity multiplied by the depth. As the horizontal velocity stretches or compresses the ocean as a sheet, the volume thins or thickens, respectively.

The boundary conditions dictate no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom.

The Coriolis effect (inertial force) steers flows moving towards the Equator to the west and flows moving away from the Equator toward the east, allowing coastally trapped waves. Finally, a dissipation term can be added which is an analog to viscosity.

===Amplitude and cycle time===
The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about {{convert|54|cm|in}} at the highest point, which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth, there were no landmasses, and the Earth were rotating in step with the Moon's orbit. The Sun similarly causes tides, of which the theoretical amplitude is about {{convert|25|cm|in}} (46% of that of the Moon) with a cycle time of 12 hours. At spring tide the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of {{convert|79|cm|in}}, while at neap tide the theoretical level is reduced to {{convert|29|cm|in}}. Since the orbits of the Earth about the Sun, and the Moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying Earth–Sun and Earth–Moon distances. This causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about ±18% for the Moon and ±5% for the Sun. If both the Sun and Moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon, the theoretical amplitude would reach {{convert|93|cm|in}}.

Real amplitudes differ considerably, not only because of depth variations and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the Equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth's [[lithosphere]] has a natural period of about 57 minutes). [[Earth tide]]s, which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide's own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean's response to tidal forces.

===Dissipation===
{{See also|Tidal acceleration}}
&lt;!--this seems misleading in terms of the oceanography. Is this global average? Cites please!: Because the lunar tidal forces drive the oceans with a period of about 12.42 hours, which is considerably less than the natural period of the oceans, complex resonance phenomena take place. This, as well as the effects of friction, gives rise to an average lag time of 11 minutes between the occurrence of high water and lunar zenith. This tidal lag time corresponds to an angle of about 3 degrees between the position of the Moon, the center of the Earth, and the location of the global average high water.

Regarding the Earth–Moon system by itself (excluding the sun for the moment) unless both bodies' spin axes align perpendicularly to the orbital plane, oscillations result. Such oscillations contribute to tidal dissipation.

Dissipation by internal fluctuating deformations of the Earth due to the lunar tidal force is small compared with the dissipation in the Earth's oceans and seas, which account for 98% of the reduction of the Earth's rotational energy.&lt;ref name=Ray1996&gt;{{Cite journal

Dissipation arises as basin-scale tidal flows drive smaller-scale flows which experience turbulent dissipation. This tidal drag creates torque on the moon that gradually transfers angular momentum to its orbit, and a gradual increase in Earth–moon separation. The equal and opposite torque on the Earth correspondingly decreases its rotational velocity. Thus, over geologic time, the moon recedes from the Earth, at about {{convert|3.8|cm|in}}/year, lengthening the terrestrial day.&lt;ref&gt;The day is currently lengthening at a rate of about 0.002 seconds per century.

[[Tidal acceleration|Day length has increased]] by about 2 hours in the last 600 million years. Assuming (as a crude approximation) that the deceleration rate has been constant, this would imply that 70 million years ago, day length was on the order of 1% shorter with about 4 more days per year.

===Bathymetry===
[[File:Gorey Harbour at low tide.JPG|thumb|The harbour of [[Gorey, Jersey]] falls dry at low tide.]]
The shape of the shoreline and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, so there is no simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater [[bathymetry]] and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] and the time of high or low tide (the [[lunitidal interval]]) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], U.S., predictably occurs approximately two and a half hours before the Moon passes directly overhead.

Land masses and ocean basins act as barriers against water moving freely around the globe, and their varied shapes and sizes affect the size of tidal frequencies. As a result, tidal patterns vary. For example, in the U.S., the East coast has predominantly semi-diurnal tides, as do Europe's Atlantic coasts, while the West coast predominantly has mixed tides.&lt;ref name=noaa7b&gt;U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (Education section), [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/tides/media/supp_tide07b.html map showing world distribution of tide patterns], semi-diurnal, diurnal and mixed semi-diurnal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From ancient times, tidal observation and discussion has increased in  sophistication, first marking the daily recurrence, then tides' relationship to the Sun and moon. [[Pytheas]] travelled to the [[British Isles]] about 325 BC and seems to be the first to have related spring tides to the phase of the moon.

In the 2nd century BC, the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomer]], [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], correctly described the phenomenon of tides in order to support his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He correctly theorized that tides were caused by the [[moon]], although he believed that the interaction was mediated by the [[pneuma]]. He noted that tides varied in time and strength in different parts of the world. According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to link tides to the lunar attraction, and that the height of the tides depends on the moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Naturalis Historia'']] of [[Pliny the Elder]] collates many tidal observations, e.g., the spring tides are a few days after (or before) new and full moon and are highest around the equinoxes, though Pliny noted many relationships now regarded as fanciful. In his ''Geography'', Strabo described tides in the [[Persian Gulf]] having their greatest range when the moon was furthest from the plane of the Equator. All this despite the relatively small amplitude of [[Mediterranean]] basin tides. (The strong currents through the [[Euripus Strait]] and the [[Strait of Messina]] puzzled [[Aristotle]].) [[Philostratus]] discussed tides in Book Five of ''The Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]''. Philostratus mentions the moon, but attributes tides to "spirits". In Europe around 730 AD, the Venerable [[Bede]] described how the rising tide on one coast of the British Isles coincided with the fall on the other and described the time progression of high water along the Northumbrian coast.

The first [[tide table]] in [[China]] was recorded in 1056 AD primarily for visitors wishing to see the famous [[tidal bore]] in the [[Qiantang River]]. The first known British tide table is thought to be that of John Wallingford, who died Abbot of St. Albans in 1213, based on high water occurring 48 minutes later each day, and three hours earlier at the [[Thames]] mouth than upriver at [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, D.E. (1999). ''Tides, A Scientific History'': 11, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] led the first systematic [[harmonic analysis]] of tidal records starting in 1867. The main result was the building of a [[tide-predicting machine]] using a system of pulleys to add together six harmonic time functions. It was "programmed" by resetting gears and chains to adjust phasing and amplitudes. Similar machines were used until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first known sea-level record of an entire spring–neap cycle was made in 1831 on the Navy Dock in the [[Thames Estuary]]. Many large ports had automatic tide gauge stations by 1850.

[[William Whewell]] first mapped co-tidal lines ending with a nearly global chart in 1836. In order to make these maps consistent, he hypothesized the existence of amphidromes where co-tidal lines meet in the mid-ocean. These points of no tide were confirmed by measurement in 1840 by Captain Hewett, RN, from careful soundings in the North Sea.&lt;ref name="tidhist"/&gt;

===Timing===
[[File:Diurnal tide types map.jpg|thumb|The same tidal forcing has different results depending on many factors, including coast orientation, continental shelf margin, water body dimensions.|alt=World map showing the location of diurnal, semi-diurnal, and mixed semi-diurnal tides. The European and African west coasts are exclusively semi-diurnal, and North America's West coast is mixed semi-diurnal, but elsewhere the different patterns are highly intermixed, although a given pattern may cover {{convert|200|-|2000|km|mi}}.]]
The tidal forces due to the Moon and Sun generate very long  waves which travel all around the ocean following the paths shown in [[Tide#Phase and amplitude|co-tidal charts]]. The time when the crest of the wave reaches a port then gives the time of high water at the port. The time taken for the wave to travel around the ocean also means that there is a delay between the phases of the Moon and their effect on the tide. Springs and neaps in the [[North Sea]], for example, are two days behind the new/full moon and first/third quarter moon. This is called the tide's ''age''.&lt;ref&gt;

The ocean [[bathymetry]] greatly influences the tide's exact time and height at a particular [[coast]]al point. There are some extreme cases; the [[Bay of Fundy]], on the east coast of Canada, is often stated to have the world's highest tides because of its shape, bathymetry, and its distance from the continental shelf edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Southampton]] in the United Kingdom has a double high water caused by the interaction between the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tidal constituents.&lt;ref name=Pingree_1978&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingree|first=R.D.|author2=L. Maddock|title=Deep-Sea Research|year=1978|volume=25|pages=53–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] has double low waters for the same reason.  The ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tide is found all along the south coast of the United Kingdom, but its effect is most noticeable between the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] because the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide is lowest in this region.

Because the oscillation modes of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] do not coincide with any significant astronomical forcing period, the largest tides are close to their narrow connections with the Atlantic Ocean. Extremely small tides also occur for the same reason in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Sea of Japan]]. Elsewhere, as along the southern coast of [[Australia]], low tides can be due to the presence of a nearby [[Amphidromic point|amphidrome]].

===Analysis===
[[File:Water surface level changes with tides.svg|thumb|A regular water level chart]]
[[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of gravitation first enabled an explanation of why there were generally two tides a day, not one, and offered hope for a detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior. Although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings, the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated by the body of water over many days. In addition, accurate results would require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basins—their [[bathymetry]], and coastline shape.

Current procedure for analysing tides follows the method of harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson]]. It is based on the principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of Sun and Moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality.  At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured for a period of time sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component.  Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.

The main patterns in the tides are
* the twice-daily variation
* the difference between the first and second tide of a day
* the spring–neap cycle
* the annual variation
The ''Highest Astronomical Tide'' is the perigean spring tide when both the Sun and Moon are closest to the Earth.

When confronted by a periodically varying function, the standard approach is to employ [[Fourier series]], a form of analysis that uses [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al functions as a ''basis'' set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle. These multiples are called ''harmonics'' of the fundamental frequency, and the process is termed [[harmonic analysis]]. If the basis set of sinusoidal functions suit the behaviour being modelled, relatively few harmonic terms need to be added. Orbital paths are very nearly circular, so sinusoidal variations are suitable for tides.

For the analysis of tide heights, the Fourier series approach has in practice to be made more elaborate than the use of a single frequency and its harmonics.  The tidal patterns are decomposed into many sinusoids having many fundamental frequencies, corresponding (as in the [[Lunar theory#Results of the theories|lunar theory]]) to many different combinations of the motions of the Earth, the Moon, and the angles that define the shape and location of their orbits.

For tides, then, ''harmonic analysis'' is not limited to harmonics of a single frequency.&lt;ref&gt;To demonstrate this [http://www.arachnoid.com/tides/index.html Tides Home Page] offers a tidal height pattern converted into an ''.mp3'' sound file, and the rich sound is quite different from a pure tone.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the harmonies are multiples of many fundamental frequencies, not just of the fundamental frequency of the simpler Fourier series approach.  Their representation as a Fourier series having only one fundamental frequency and its (integer) multiples would require many terms, and would be severely limited in the time-range for which it would be valid.

The study of tide height by harmonic analysis was begun by Laplace, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and [[George Darwin]]. [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A.T. Doodson]] extended their work, introducing the ''Doodson Number'' notation to organise the hundreds of resulting terms. This approach has been the international standard ever since, and the complications arise as follows: the tide-raising force is notionally given by sums of several terms. Each term is of the form
: &lt;math&gt; A \cos\,(\omega t + p) &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} is the amplitude, {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/var&gt;}} is the angular frequency usually given in degrees per hour corresponding to {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} measured in hours, and {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} is the phase offset with regard to the astronomical state at time ''t'' = 0&amp;nbsp;. There is one term for the Moon and a second term for the Sun. The phase {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}} of the first harmonic for the Moon term is called the [[lunitidal interval]] or high water interval. The next step is to accommodate the harmonic terms due to the elliptical shape of the orbits. Accordingly, the value of {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} is not a constant but also varying with time, slightly, about some average figure. Replace it then by {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} where A is another sinusoid, similar to the cycles and epicycles of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic theory]]. Accordingly,
: &lt;math&gt; A(t) = A\bigl(1 + A_a \cos\,(\omega_a t + p_a)\bigr) &lt;/math&gt;
which is to say an average value {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} with a sinusoidal variation about it of magnitude {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, with frequency {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and phase {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}. Thus the simple term is now the product of two cosine factors:
: &lt;math&gt; A \bigl[ 1 + A_a \cos\,(\omega_a t + p_a)\bigr] \cos\,(\omega t + p) &lt;/math&gt;

Given that for any {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;}}
: &lt;math&gt;\cos x \cos y = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} \cos\,( x + y ) + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}} \cos\,( x - y )&lt;/math&gt;
it is clear that a compound term involving the product of two cosine terms each with their own frequency is the same as ''three'' simple cosine terms that are to be added at the original frequency and also at frequencies which are the sum and difference of the two frequencies of the product term. (Three, not two terms, since the whole expression is &lt;math&gt;(1 + \cos x)\cos y&lt;/math&gt;.) Consider further that the tidal force on a location depends also on whether the Moon (or the Sun) is above or below the plane of the Equator, and that these attributes have their own periods also incommensurable with a day and a month, and it is clear that many combinations result. With a careful choice of the basic astronomical frequencies, the Doodson Number annotates the particular additions and differences to form the frequency of each simple cosine term.

Remember that astronomical tides do ''not'' include weather effects. Also, changes to local conditions (sandbank movement, dredging harbour mouths, etc.) away from those prevailing at the measurement time affect the tide's actual timing and magnitude. Organisations quoting a "highest astronomical tide" for some location may exaggerate the figure as a safety factor against analytical uncertainties, distance from the nearest measurement point, changes since the last observation time, ground subsidence, etc., to avert liability should an engineering work be overtopped. Special care is needed when assessing the size of a "weather surge" by subtracting the astronomical tide from the observed tide.

Careful Fourier [[data analysis]] over a nineteen-year period (the ''National Tidal Datum Epoch'' in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the ''tidal harmonic constituents''. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, Moon and Sun's relative positions repeat almost exactly in the [[Metonic cycle]] of 19&amp;nbsp;years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal [[Earth tide#Tidal constituents|tidal constituent]]. This analysis can be done using only the knowledge of the forcing ''period'', but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

|date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12&amp;nbsp;hours (the ''semi-diurnal'' constituents), but there are major constituents near 24&amp;nbsp;hours (''diurnal'') as well. Longer term constituents are 14&amp;nbsp;day or ''fortnightly'', monthly, and semiannual. Semi-diurnal tides dominated coastline, but some areas such as the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(lunar) and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14&amp;nbsp;day period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/harmonic_cons_defs.html Harmonic Constituents], [[NOAA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plot above, each cotidal line differs by one hour from its neighbors, and the thicker lines show tides in phase with equilibrium at Greenwich. The lines rotate around the [[amphidromic point]]s counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere so that from [[Baja California Peninsula]] to [[Alaska]] and from [[France]] to [[Ireland]] the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide propagates northward. In the southern hemisphere this direction is clockwise. On the other hand, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tide propagates counterclockwise around New Zealand, but this is because the islands act as a dam and permit the tides to have different heights on the islands' opposite sides. (The tides do propagate northward on the east side and southward on the west coast, as predicted by theory.)

The exception is at [[Cook Strait]] where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water. This is because cotidal lines 180° around the amphidromes are in opposite phase, for example high water across from low water at each end of Cook Strait. Each tidal constituent has a different pattern of amplitudes, phases, and amphidromic points, so the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; patterns cannot be used for other tide components.

Because the Moon is moving in its orbit around the Earth and in the same sense as the Earth's rotation, a point on the Earth must rotate slightly further to catch up so that the time between semidiurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hours—a bit over twenty-five minutes extra. The two peaks are not equal. The two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), higher high (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.

When the Earth, Moon, and Sun are in line (Sun–Earth–Moon, or Sun–Moon–Earth) the two main influences combine to produce spring tides; when the two forces are opposing each other as when the angle Moon–Earth–Sun is close to ninety degrees, neap tides result. As the Moon moves around its orbit it changes from north of the Equator to south of the Equator. The alternation in high tide heights becomes smaller, until they are the same (at the lunar equinox, the Moon is above the Equator), then redevelop but with the other polarity, waxing to a maximum difference and then waning again.

===Current===
The tides' influence on current flow is much more difficult to analyse, and data is much more difficult to collect. A tidal height is a simple number which applies to a wide region simultaneously. A flow has both a magnitude and a direction, both of which can vary substantially with depth and over short distances due to local bathymetry. Also, although a water channel's center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways. A flow proceeding up a curved channel is the same flow, even though its direction varies continuously along the channel. Surprisingly, flood and ebb flows are often not in opposite directions. Flow direction is determined by the upstream channel's shape, not the downstream channel's shape. Likewise, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] may form in only one flow direction.

Nevertheless, current analysis is similar to tidal analysis: in the simple case, at a given location the flood flow is in mostly one direction, and the ebb flow in another direction. Flood velocities are given positive sign, and ebb velocities negative sign. Analysis proceeds as though these are tide heights.

In more complex situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the ebb and flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.

Tide flow information is most commonly seen on [[nautical chart]]s, presented as a table of flow speeds and bearings at hourly intervals, with separate tables for spring and neap tides. The timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, though it may be far away.

As with tide height predictions, tide flow predictions based only on astronomical factors do not incorporate weather conditions, which can ''completely'' change the outcome.

The tidal flow through [[Cook Strait]] between the two main islands of New Zealand is particularly interesting, as the tides on each side of the strait are almost exactly out of phase, so that one side's high water is simultaneous with the other's low water. Strong currents result, with almost zero tidal height change in the strait's center. Yet, although the tidal surge normally flows in one direction for six hours and in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions, the reverse surge might be entirely overcome so that the flow continues in the same direction through three or more surge periods.

A further complication for Cook Strait's flow pattern is that the tide at the north side (e.g. at [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]) follows the common bi-weekly spring–neap tide cycle (as found along the west side of the country), but the south side's tidal pattern has only ''one'' cycle per month, as on the east side: [[Wellington]], and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]].

The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows separately the high water and low water height and time, through November 2007; these are ''not'' measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's nautical chart offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41°13·9’S 174°29·6’E (north west of [[Cape Terawhiti]]) refers timings to [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]] while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti in the middle of Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the actual currents through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart spring tide at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Power generation===
{{Main article|Tidal power}}
Tidal energy can be extracted by two means: inserting a water [[turbine]] into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine. In the first case, the energy amount is entirely determined by the timing and tidal current magnitude. However, the best currents may be unavailable because the turbines would obstruct ships. In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, [[Rance tidal power plant|La Rance]] at [[St Malo|Saint Malo]], France) which face many difficulties. Aside from environmental issues, simply withstanding corrosion and biological fouling pose engineering challenges.

Tidal power proponents point out that, unlike wind power systems, generation levels can be reliably predicted, save for weather effects. While some generation is possible for most of the tidal cycle, in practice turbines lose efficiency at lower operating rates. Since the power available from a flow is proportional to the cube of the flow speed, the times during which high power generation is possible are brief.

==Navigation==
[[File:Tide legal use.gif|thumb|left|US civil and maritime uses of tidal data|alt=Chart illustrating that tidal heights enter in calculations of legally significant data such as ''boundary lines'' between the high seas and territorial waters. Chart shows an exemplar coastline, identifying bottom features such as longshore bar and berms, tidal heights such as mean higher high water, and distances from shore such as the 12 mile limit.]]

Tidal flows are important for navigation, and significant errors in position occur if they are not accommodated. Tidal heights are also important; for example many rivers and harbours have a shallow "bar" at the entrance which prevents boats with significant [[Draft (hull)|draft]] from entering at low tide.

Until the advent of automated navigation, competence in calculating tidal effects was important to naval officers. The certificate of examination for lieutenants in the [[Royal Navy]] once declared that the prospective officer was able to "shift his tides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal flow timings and velocities appear in ''tide charts'' or a [[tidal stream atlas]]. Tide charts come in sets. Each chart covers a single hour between one high water and another (they ignore the leftover 24 minutes) and show the average tidal flow for that hour. An arrow on the tidal chart indicates the direction and the average flow speed (usually in [[Knot (unit)|knots]]) for spring and neap tides. If a tide chart is not available, most nautical charts have "[[tidal diamond]]s" which relate specific points on the chart to a table giving tidal flow direction and speed.

The standard procedure to counteract tidal effects on navigation is to (1) calculate a "[[dead reckoning]]" position (or DR) from travel distance and direction, (2) mark the chart (with a vertical cross like a plus sign) and (3) draw a line from the DR in the tide's direction. The distance the tide moves the boat along this line is computed by the tidal speed, and this gives an "estimated position" or EP (traditionally marked with a dot in a triangle).

[[File:Tidal Indicator Delaware River ca1897.jpg|thumb|Tidal Indicator, Delaware River, Delaware c. 1897. At the time shown in the figure, the tide is {{frac|1|1|4}} feet above mean low water and is still falling, as indicated by pointing of the arrow. Indicator is powered by system of pulleys, cables and a float.

[[Nautical chart]]s display the water's "charted depth" at specific locations with "[[Echo sounding|sounding]]s" and the use of bathymetric [[contour line]]s to depict the submerged surface's shape. These depths are relative to a "[[chart datum]]", which is typically the water level at the lowest possible astronomical tide (although other datums are commonly used, especially historically, and tides may be lower or higher for meteorological reasons) and are therefore the minimum possible water depth during the tidal cycle. "Drying heights" may also be shown on the chart, which are the heights of the exposed [[seabed]] at the lowest astronomical tide.

Tide tables list each day's high and low water heights and times. To calculate the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height. Depth for other times can be derived from tidal curves published for major ports. The [[rule of twelfths]] can suffice if an accurate curve is not available. This approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour — 1/12, second — 2/12, third — 3/12, fourth — 3/12, fifth — 2/12, sixth — 1/12.

==Biological aspects==

===Intertidal ecology===
[[File:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A rock, seen at low water, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation.|alt=Photo of partially submerged rock showing horizontal bands of different color and texture, where each band represents a different fraction of time spent submerged.]]
{{Main article|Intertidal ecology}}
{{Further information|Intertidal zone}}

Intertidal ecology is the study of [[ecosystem]]s between the low- and high-water lines along a shore. At low water, the intertidal zone is exposed (or ''emersed''), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or ''immersed''). Intertidal [[ecologist]]s therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as among the [[biological interaction|different species]]. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates — [[rocky shore]] or soft bottom.

Intertidal organisms experience a highly variable and often hostile environment, and have [[adaptation|adapted]] to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature is [[vertical zonation]], in which the community divides into distinct horizontal bands of specific species at each elevation above low water. A species' ability to cope with [[desiccation]] determines its upper limit, while [[competition (biology)|competition]] with other species sets its lower limit.

Humans [[Exploitation of natural resources|use]] [[Intertidal ecology|intertidal regions]] for food and recreation. [[Overexploitation]] can damage intertidals directly. Other anthropogenic actions such as introducing [[invasive species]] and [[global warming|climate change]] have large negative effects.

===Biological rhythms===
The approximately fortnightly tidal cycle has large effects on intertidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bos, A.R. |author2=Gumanao, G.S. |author3=van Katwijk, M.M. |author4=Mueller, B. |author5=Saceda, M.M. |author6=Tejada, R.P. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2011 |title=Ontogenetic habitat shift, population growth, and burrowing behavior of the Indo-Pacific beach star ''Archaster typicus'' (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) |journal=Marine Biology |volume=158 |issue= 3|pages=639–648|doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1588-0|pmid=24391259 |pmc=3873073}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bos, A.R. |author2= Gumanao, G.S. |last-author-amp= yes |date=2012 |title=The lunar cycle determines availability of coral reef fishes on fish markets |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=2074–2079|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03454.x |pmid= 23130702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence their [[biological rhythm]]s tend to occur in rough multiples of this period. Many other animals such as the [[vertebrate]]s, display similar rhythms. Examples include [[gestation]] and egg hatching. In humans, the [[menstrual cycle]] lasts roughly a [[lunar month]], an even multiple of the tidal period. Such parallels at least hint at the [[common descent]] of all animals from a marine ancestor.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;{{cite book

==Other tides==
When oscillating tidal currents in the stratified ocean flow over uneven bottom topography, they generate [[internal wave]]s with tidal frequencies. Such waves are called ''[[internal tide]]s''.

Shallow areas in otherwise open water can experience rotary tidal currents, flowing in directions that continually change and thus the flow direction (not the flow) completes a full rotation in {{frac|12|1|2}} hours (for example, the [[Nantucket Shoals]]).&lt;ref name=rocur&gt;Le Lacheur, Embert A. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/208104 Tidal currents in the open sea: Subsurface tidal currents at Nantucket Shoals Light Vessel] ''[[Geographical Review]]'', April 1924. Accessed: 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience ''[[atmospheric tide]]s'' and ''[[Earth tide]]s''. These are [[continuum mechanics|continuum mechanical]] phenomena. The first two take place in [[fluid mechanics|fluid]]s. The third affects the Earth's thin [[Solid mechanics|solid]] crust surrounding its semi-liquid interior (with various modifications).

===Lake tides===
Large lakes such as [[Lake Superior|Superior]] and [[Lake Erie|Erie]] can experience tides of {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, but these can be masked by meteorologically induced phenomena such as [[seiche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Atmospheric tides===
Atmospheric tides are negligible at ground level and aviation altitudes, masked by [[weather]]'s much more important effects.&lt;!-- and solar thermal tides. However, there is no strict upper limit to the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and the tidal pull increases with the distance from the Earth's center.--&gt; Atmospheric tides are both gravitational and thermal in origin and are the dominant dynamics from about {{convert|80| to |120|km|mi}}, above which the molecular density becomes too low to support fluid behavior.

===Earth tides===
{{Main article|Earth tide}}

Earth tides or terrestrial tides affect the entire Earth's mass, which acts similarly to a liquid [[gyroscope]] with a very thin crust. The Earth's crust shifts (in/out, east/west, north/south) in response to lunar and solar gravitation, ocean tides, and atmospheric loading. While negligible for most human activities, terrestrial tides' semi-diurnal amplitude can reach about {{convert|55|cm|in}} at the Equator—{{convert|15|cm|in}} due to the Sun—which is important in [[GPS]] calibration and [[VLBI]] measurements. Precise astronomical angular measurements require knowledge of the Earth's rotation rate and [[polar motion]], both of which are influenced by Earth tides. The semi-diurnal ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Earth tides are nearly in phase with the Moon with a lag of about two hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Galactic tides===
''[[Galactic tide]]s'' are the tidal forces exerted by galaxies on stars within them and [[Satellite galaxy|satellite galaxies]] orbiting them. The galactic tide's effects on the [[Solar System]]'s [[Oort cloud]] are believed to cause 90 percent of long-period comets.&lt;ref&gt;

==Misnomers==
[[Tsunami]]s, the large waves that occur after earthquakes, are sometimes called ''tidal waves'', but this name is given by their ''resemblance'' to the tide, rather than any actual link to the tide. Other phenomena unrelated to tides but using the word ''tide'' are [[rip current|rip tide]], [[storm tide]], [[hurricane tide]], and [[oil spill|black]] or [[red tide]]s.  Many of these usages are historic and refer to the earlier meaning of tide as "a portion of time, a season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|tide|volume=XVIII|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digitales_Geländemodell.png|thumb|TIN overlaid with [[contour line]]s]]

A '''triangulated irregular network''' ('''TIN''') is a representation of a continuous surface consisting entirely of triangular facets, used mainly as [[Discrete Global Grid]] in [[digital elevation model#Types_of_DEM|primary elevation modeling]].  

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means.  Associated with three-dimensional data (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (''x'' and ''y'') distributions and relationships.

Digital TIN [[data structures]] are used in a variety of applications, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is an [[Array data type|vector]]-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed [[vertex (geometry)|nodes]] and lines with [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles.

A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated [[coordinates]] in three [[dimensions]] connected by edges to form a triangular [[tessellation]]. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased.

A TIN used to represent [[terrain]] is often called a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM).  An advantage of using a TIN over a  [[rasterized]] [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an [[algorithm]] that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's [[slope]] and [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN.

TIN are based on a [[Delaunay triangulation]] or constrained Delaunay.  Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations.  A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator.  Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified.

The TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points.  The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research – Triangulated Irregular Network |accessdate=2007-07-26 |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/pmwiki/Research/TriangulatedIrregularNetwork }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System==
The newly revised classification system presented in this report is designed for use in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Library and other earth science libraries. Prior to the administration of Fred Boughton Weeks, 1903-1908, the library lacked a classification scheme. The Dewey Decimal system for geologic material was not sufficiently developed to accommodate the range of specialized material collected at the USGS Library, and The [[Library of Congress Classification]] System had not yet been published. The library staff and patrons were concerned about continued development of the collection without an acceptable classification scheme.
Mr. Weeks and bibliographer John M. Nickles of the library staff, with the assistance of three
consultants from the New York Public Library, developed the USGS classification system designed specifically for an earth science library.
The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science
libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers.
The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Sasscer, R. Scott. 1992, 2000. "U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System." U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2010. Revised June 2000. Published in the Eastern Region, Reston, Va.

==Special Library Collections==

===Field Records Collection — Denver, Colorado===
The [http://www.cr.usgs.gov/fieldrecords/ Field Records Collection] is an archive of unpublished field notes, correspondence, manuscripts, maps, analysis reports and other data created or collected by USGS geologists during field studies and other project work. The majority of the collection dates from 1879 and relates to work done in the contiguous United States. Materials in the collection represent almost 130 years of scientific investigations by the USGS, from the earliest days of the agency to recently completed projects. Records contributed by approximately 1,200 USGS scientists are presently archived. Located in the Central Region Library in Denver, Colorado, the collection is available for on-premises examination during normal library hours.
Field records and project archives on [[Alaska]] are kept in the Alaska Technical Data Unit Field Records Archive.

===Rare Books and Maps===
The Rare Book Collection of the USGS Library comprises unusual publications, rare books, and maps collected since 1879. Included are historical maps and publications of the Survey, as well as early publications of many federal, state and other geological surveys. Records of select geological societies are also maintained in the collection, such as the [[Geological Society of Washington]], which was founded by [[John Wesley Powell]] and other noted scientists after the Civil War. Of special note are many 19th century maps with topics such as American political boundaries, transportation, geology, and mining.

===Desnoyers Collection===
At an auction in Paris, France, pieces of M. [[Jules Desnoyers]]'s (1800–1887) library were purchased in 1885 by the USGS Library to start the foreign country collection. M. Desnoyers was a founder and later Secretary of the [[Société Géologique de France]], and in 1834 he was appointed librarian of the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris.

===William R. Halliday Collection===
William R. Halliday, M.D. (b. 1926), joined the [[National Speleological Society]] in 1947. By the late 1950s he was director of the [[Western Speleological Survey]]. His works include Adventure Is Underground (1959), Caves of California (1962), Caves of Washington (1963), Depths of the Earth (1966), Caves and Cavers of the United States (1966), American Caves and Caving (1974), Discovery and Exploration of the Oregon Caves: [[Oregon Caves National Monument]] (with [[Frank K. Walsh]]; 1976) and, [[Floyd Collins]] of Sand Cave: A Photographic Memorial (1998). He donated his private collection of rare and out-of-print books and pamphlets on caves, caving and speleology to the USGS Library in 2000.

Dr. Halliday has also donated several collections of private papers, correspondence and research to the [[University of Washington]] Library and to the [[J. Willard Marriott Library]] of the [[University of Utah]].

===Kunz Collection===
In 1933, the Library acquired the [[George F. Kunz]] collection for $1.00 from the estate of the former USGS employee and Vice-President of [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]  The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection on gems and minerals including rare books on gemology, the folklore of gemstones through history, lapidary arts and archival gem trade records important to the provenance of named stones such as the "[[Hope Diamond]]." Kunz was a former USGS employee, a vice-president of Tiffany &amp; Co., and one of the world's preeminent gem experts. The collection was acquired through the genroisty of Dr. Kunz's heirs, Mrs. [[Opal Kunz]] and Mrs. [[Hans Zinsser]]. Mr. Walter E. Reid, mining consultant and strong friend of the library, was largely instrumental in securing the Kunz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection of many rare books, pamphlets, and other unique materials on the acquisition, collecting and lore of jewels and precious stones. Acquired by the US Geological Survey Library in 1933 after the death of George F. Kunz, a noted mineralogist and vice-president of the Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York, the Kunz Collection today is fairly unknown outside of a small circle of gemologists, historians, and art collectors. In this paper, a short biography of George F. Kunz is given, as well as a description of the contents and scope of his collection held in the USGS Library. Some examples of the unique materials held in the collection are shown. How the Kunz Collection is used by library patrons and museums is also discussed. Appended to the paper is a bibliography of the works by and about Dr. Kunz."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://rock.geosociety.org/absindex/annual/1999/50292.htm "George F. Kunz Collection."] Denver, Colorado: Geoscience Information Society, 34th annual meeting, 1999. Includes bibliographic references (p. 142-146). Paper presented to the Geological Society of America Annual Convention in Denver, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map Collection===
The library's map collections have provided invaluable aid to authorities and scientists in times of crisis (the California Northridge earthquake in 1994 and major fires in the nation's forests). Topographic maps have also been used for genealogy research to pinpoint where ancestors lived, locate forgotten cemeteries, provide information on boundary changes, and research natural and man-made changes to areas over time. Planners have used the foreign map collections to study foreign terrain, geologic conditions and natural resources. During WWII, The [[New York Times]] (June 11, 1944) reported "A 'Commando' raid by a group of civilian scientists, a search through obscure seventeenth century French manuscripts, months of study of geological reports, experiments with model beaches – all these were part of the Allied preparations for the invasion of Normandy … The dramatic story of the preparations, which began in … libraries, shifted to laboratories and ended on the shell-swept beaches …". The collections were consulted for the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Library maps have provided aid in international disaster areas such as the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and volcanoes worldwide. A brief mention of a diamond found in the 1906 annual report of the USGS began a trail of research and investigation that led one geologist to prospect for diamonds in Canada.

===Topographic Map Archive===
Responsibility for the Topographic Map Archive was formally transferred to the USGS Library in Reston, Virginia, in March 2003. The Archive includes each U.S. state and territory, in all scales, editions and various printings. With coverage dating from the 1880s when the USGS began publishing standard topographic quadrangles; the Archive is the most complete collection of USGS topographic maps.

===Heringen Collection===
The Heringen Collection, is a group of military texts and maps, looted by the Nazis from European libraries, universities, geological societies, private businesses, homes and offices. Hidden in a potash mine in [[Heringen]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], they were transported by the U.S. military at the end of WWII as captured war materials. Some 23,000 reports, books and maps were accepted by the USGS Library and integrated into the main collection. The materials are consulted for research ranging from European road development, water resources use or mining and construction. In 1946, the Heringen Collection was transferred from the U.S. Geological Survey's [[Military Geology Unit]] to the Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "The Heringen Collection." Information Bulletin. Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML). Volume 40 (1), November 2008. {{ISSN|0049-7282}}. Page 15.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in journal, Earth Sciences History, the author says that the results of the German theft of Russian maps influenced the way they made maps for the next two generations. "The Heringen Collection at the US Geological Survey is a special collection of maps, books and reports stolen by units of the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) as they invaded and occupied countries during World War II. The materials in the Collection came from private, society and public library collections, and were used by military geologists in each German army to help protect its soldiers, to advance their invasion, and to consolidate their occupation. They used the maps of the occupied countries against their peoples. For a generation after the invasion of the Soviet Union, this influenced the way Russian maps were drawn and printed."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA496551  "The Heringen Collection of the US Geological Survey Library of Reston, Virginia."] Earth Sciences History, Volume 27, Number 2. Page 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Antarctic Resource Center===
The U.S. Antarctic Resource Center (USARC) in Reston, Virginia, is our Nation's depository for [[Antarctic]] maps, charts, geodetic ground control, satellite images, aerial photographs, publications, slides, and video tapes. These resources are produced by [[Antarctic Treaty]] nations in support of their activities in Antarctica and provided to the USARC in compliance with a standing resolution of the treaty providing for exchange of information. The USGS maintains these materials through an interagency cooperative agreement with the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), which also supports the USGS Antarctic Mapping Program.

===USGS Photographic Collection===
The [http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov Photographic Library] is an archive of still photographs and original sketches dating from the 1870s and taken by USGS scientists as part of their field studies. Topics include USGS personnel, earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena, historical mining operations, and earth science photographs. The works of pioneer photographers such as [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], [[Carleton Watkins]], [[John Karl Hillers]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[Andrew J. Russell]], [[E. O. Beaman]] and [[William Bell (photographer)]] are represented in the collection. Some photographs have been used to illustrate publications, but most have never been published.

==History==
Congress authorized a Library for the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1879. The library was formally established in 1882, with the naming of the first librarian, Charles C. Darwin, and began with a staff of 3 and a collection of 1,400 books. The Act of Congress establishing the USGS authorized the creation of a program for exchanging copies of USGS reports for publications of state, national, and international organizations. The exchange program was modeled after a program used by Dr. [[Ferdinand V. Hayden]] when he was head of the Interior Department's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories (1867–1879). The U.S. Geological Survey Library inherited 1,000 volumes of serials from Dr. Hayden's former exchange program, which he had based on the program begun by the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.
After Dr. Hayden died in 1887, his widow donated his personal collection to the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Other early gifts were made by Major [[John Wesley Powell]], second Director of the US Geological Survey, who donated his collection of State Geological Survey reports and the family of Dr. [[Isaac Lea]] (Philadelphia publisher and gem collector whose family donated nearly 600 items of his personal library). Dr. William Halliday, a world-renowned speleologist began donating his cave collection in 2003.

In a review of the USGS Library operations in 1937, William Heers, the Chief Librarian, noted that the library had more than 200,000 books and reports, about 60,000 pamphlets, and also about 60,000 maps, most of these obtained by gift and exchange. Fully half of those researchers who used the library were outside of the US Geological Survey. In service to those outside the government, between 8-10,000 books were loaned out each year through [[interlibrary loan]]s, both within the continental US and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the USGS Library during its centennial, it was noted that in 1978 the library had acquired nearly 116,000 new items. About 75% of these were journals, of which 10,000 serial, magazine, and other periodical titles were received. In 1978, the library also circulated 105,000 items, made 17,700 [[interlibrary loan]]s and answered some 27,000 requests for information.&lt;ref&gt;"Books, Maps..." Geotimes. March 1979. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the USGS Library joined the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/general_pages/2012BHLMembership.pdf Press Release: Biodiversity Heritage Library Adds Two Partners. Smithsonian Libraries. March 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of contributing important historical works related to taxonomy as well as relevant USGS publications.

The U.S. Geological Survey Library system has become the largest earth science library in the world. Materials within the library system include books and maps dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Other materials include a nearly complete set of the various State Geological Survey publications and a virtually complete set of USGS topographic maps.
The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with domestic and international scientific organizations.

'''Water Remote Sensing''' studies the [[color of water]] through the observation of the [[spectrum]] of water leaving radiation. From the study of this spectrum, the concentration of optically active components of the upper layer of the water body can be concluded via specific [[algorithms]].&lt;ref name="Laanen"&gt;Laanen, M.L. (2007)."[http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/10799/8066.pdf?sequence=5Jun Yellow Matters- Improving the remote sensing of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter in inland freshwaters]" Ph.D. Thesis. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: The NL.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Water quality]] monitoring by [[remote sensing]] and close-range instruments has obtained considerable attention since the founding of EU Water Framework Directive.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;

== History ==

If water remote sensing is defined as the observation of the water from a distance in order to describe its color, without taking water samples, the gradual development of understanding of the transparency of natural waters and of the reason of their clarity variability and coloration has been sketched from the times of Henry Hudson (1600) to those of Chandrasekhara Raman (1930).&lt;ref&gt;Marcel, R., Wernand &amp; Winfried W.C.Gieskes (2012), "Ocean Optics from 1600 (Hudson) to 1930 (Raman) Shifting interpretation of natural water colouring", Paris, France: Union des oceanographes de France (published 1 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of water remote sensing techniques (by the use of satellite imaging, aircraft or close range optical devices) didn't start until the early 1970s. These first techniques measured the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] and thermal differences in the emitted energy from water surfaces. In general, empirical relationships were settled between the spectral properties and the water quality parameters of the water body.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;Ritchie, J.C; Zimba, P.V.; Everitt, J.H. (2003), “Remote Sensing Techniques to Assess Water Quality”, American Society for Photogrammetry Engineering and Remote Sensing, 69:695-704.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Ritchie et al. (1974) &lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, J.C.; McHenry, J.R.; Schiebe, F.R.; Wilson, R.B.(1974),“The relationship of reflected solar radiation and the concentration of sediment in the surface water of reservoirs”,Remote
 Sensing of Earth Resources Vol. III (F. Shahrokhi, editor),The University of Tennessee Space Institute, Tullahoma, Tennessee,3:57–72&lt;/ref&gt; developed an empirical approach to determine suspended sediments. This kind of empirical models are only able to use to determine water quality parameters of water bodies with similar conditions. In 1992 an analytical approach was used by Schiebe et al. (1992).&lt;ref name="Schiebe"&gt;Schiebe, F.R., Harrington, Jr., J.A.; Ritchie, J.C. (1992), “Remote sensing of suspended sediments: The Lake Chicot, Arkansas project”, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 13(8):1487–1509&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was based on the optical characteristics of water and water quality parameters to elaborate a physically based model of the relationship between the spectral and physical properties of the surface water studied. This physically based model was successfully applied in order to estimate suspended sediment concentrations.&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schiebe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington, J.A., Jr., Schiebe, F.R.; Nix, J.F. (1992). “Remote sensing of Lake Chicot, Arkansas: Monitoring suspended sediments, turbidity and secchi depth with Landsat MSS”, Remote Sensing of Environment, 39(1):15–27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Water Remote sensing instruments allow to record the color of a water body, which provides information on the presence and abundance of optically active natural water components. The water color spectrum is defined as an apparent optical property (AOP) of the water. This means that the color of the water is influenced by the angular distribution of the light field and by the nature and quantity of the substances in the medium, in this case, water.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"&gt;IOCCG (2000). Remote Sensing of Ocean Colour in Coastal, and Other Optically-Complex Waters. Sathyendranath, S. (ed.), Reports of the International Ocean-Colour Coordinating Group, No. 3, IOCCG, Dartmouth, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the value of this parameter will change with changes in the optical properties and concentrations of the optically active substances in the water, the inherent optical properties or IOPS.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt; The IOPS are independent from the angular distribution of light but they are dependent from the type and substances present in the medium as well.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt; For instance, the diffuse [[attenuation coefficient]] of downwelling irradiance, Kd (it is often used as an index of water clarity or [[ocean turbidity]]) is defined as an AOP, while the [[absorption coefficient]] and the scattering coefficient of the medium are defined as IOPS.&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt;
There are two different approaches to determine the concentration of optically active water components by the study of the spectra. The first approach consist of empirical algorithms based on statistical relationships and the second approach consists of analytical algorithms based on the inversion of calibrated bio-optical models.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sathyendranath"/&gt; Accurate calibration of the relationships/models used is an important condition for successful inversion on water remote sensing techniques and the determination of concentration of water quality parameters from observed spectral remote sensing data.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;
Thus, these techniques depend on their ability to record these changes in the spectral signature of light backscattered from water surface and relate these recorded changes to water quality parameters via empirical or analytical approaches. Depending of the water constituents of interest and the sensor used, different parts of the spectrum will be analysed.&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt;

[[File:Specific phytoplankton absorption spectra.xcf|thumbnail|right|Example of specific phytoplankton absorption spectra. In this graph the characteristic blue and red Ch-a peaks at 438 nm and 676 nm can be seen. Another visible peak is the Cyanophicocianin absorption maximum at 624 nm.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;]]By the use of Optical close range devices (e.g. [[spectrometers]], [[radiometers]]), airplanes or helicopters (airborne remote sensing) and satellites (space born remote sensing), the light reflected from the water bodies is measured. For instance, algorithms are used to retrieve parameters such as [[chlorophyll-a]](Chl-a) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration, the absorption by [[colored dissolved organic matter]] at 440&amp;nbsp;nm (aCDOM) and [[secchi depth]].&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt; The measurement of these values will give an idea about the water quality of the water body being studied. A very high concentration of green pigments like chlorophyll might indicate the presence of an algal bloom, for example, due to eutrophication processes. Thus, the chlorophyll concentration could be used as a proxy or indicator for the trophic condition of a water body. In the same manner, other optical quality parameters such as suspended particles or Suspended Particulate matter (SPM), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Transparency (Kd), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) can be used to monitor water quality.&lt;ref name="Laanen" /&gt;
