==History==

===The proposal and interim council (1959–1964)===


In the late 1950s, there was an increasing focus on the global need for anthropological research into 'disappearing cultures'.&lt;ref&gt;''International Social Science Bulletin: Disappearing Cultures'', vol 9, No 3, 1957, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000247/024733eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heine-Geldern, R (1959), 'The International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research', ''American Anthropologist'', 61: 1076–1078. doi: 10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00130&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was also emerging in Australia in the work of researchers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, RM (1959), ‘Areas of research in Aboriginal Australia which demand urgent attention’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol. 2, pp 63–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehlow, TGH (1959), ‘Anthropological and ethnological research in Australia’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol 2, pp 70–5&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a proposal by [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth MP]] for the conception of an Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75"&gt;Mulvaney, DJ (2008), 'WEH Stanner and the foundation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1959–1964', p 58-75, in: ''An Appreciation of Difference: WEH Stanner and Aboriginal Australia'', Hinkson, Melinda and Beckett, Jeremy (eds), Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was made as a submission to Cabinet,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Aborigines, film and science’, ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a more comprehensive approach by the Australian Government to the recording of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"&gt;'Wentworth Lectures', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/news-and-events/events/special-events/wentworth-lectures, retrieved 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a Cabinet sub-committee assessed the proposal&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988"&gt;Chapman, Valerie (1988), 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies', ''Resources for Australian Studies in the ACT'', Biskup, Peter &amp; Goodman, Doreen (eds), Centre for Library and Information Studies, CCAE, pp194-214&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a working party at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to consider the viability of the proposal.  One of their first actions was to appoint [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; to be held in 1961 at the ANU.

Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, H (ed) 1963, ''Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; No Aboriginal people were present at the conference.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]] appointed an Interim Council in 1961.  The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA"&gt;'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall,&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"&gt;'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316112934/http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals |date=16 March 2015 }}, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected. The Interim Council completed a revised constitution in July 1963. Amendments to the document included the change from the title ‘director’ to ‘principal’ of the institute.

This version of the constitution would go on to form the basis for the creation of the new Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies the following year.&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

===AIAS early years (1964–1970)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established as a [[Statutory authority]]&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Independent Review', ''Final Report to the Department of Education'', May 2014, p (i), http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/review-of-aiatsis-full-report-2014.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under an Act of Parliament in June 1964.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;'Our history', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/our-history, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Interim Council for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia website, www.naa.gov.au,  retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute at that time has been described as "to record language, song, art, material culture, ceremonial life and social structure before those traditions perished in the face of European ways."&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"&gt;Mulvaney, D. J. 'Reflections', ''Antiquity'', Vol. 80, no. 308, June 2006, pp 425–434, http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/080/0425/ant0800425.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also reflected in the Institute’s official functions, as recorded in the Reading of the Bill in Parliament. These were:

:(a)	to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines.

:(b)	to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing.

:(c)	to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education.

:(d)	to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies.

:(e)	to publish and to support the publication of the results of research.

:(f)	to co-operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records.

:(g)	to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers.

:(h)	to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt;

AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; The founding Principal of the newly formed institute was [[Frederick McCarthy]],&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"/&gt; a professional anthropologist and graduate of Sydney University who had spent nearly 30 years working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;'Fred McCarthy: the founding principal of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, {{cite web |url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028055915/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

The Institute’s founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film Unit&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit’ , ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and championing ethnographic film in global forums.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;

In the early years of the AIAS, the Film Unit largely outsourced early filmmaking work to other companies,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002" /&gt; or worked in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (as early as 1962).&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But over the next 30 years, the Film Unit would go on to produce “one of the largest assembly of ethnographic films created in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS Collections: Film', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/film, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the AIAS official function “to publish and to support the publication of the results of research”,&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt; a publishing arm of the Institute was established in 1964. Publishing under the name Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the publishing arm released a range of papers and research findings, including in the fields of linguistics, demography, physical anthropology, history and musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, AP, 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies: Publications', in Oceania, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Sep. 1970), pp. 52–57, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329899, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The early work of the AIAS is credited with increasing interaction between academics in different fields, as well as establishing the foundations for the extensive collections AIATSIS holds today. But before 1970, there had never been an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander member on the AIAS Council.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===Self-determination and the Institute (1970–1989)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Money and other resources are in short supply for Aboriginal control of their livelihood, but not, it seems, for discussing it."'' – Eaglehawk and Crow letter, 29 March 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 1970s marked a period of change for the AIAS. This began with the appointment of the first Aboriginal member of the AIAS Council in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Jacqueline, ''A History of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 1959 -1989: An analysis of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people achieved control of a national research institute'', thesis submitted for the Doctor of Philosophy, Menzies Library, Australian National University, November 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Roberts, an Alawa man,&lt;ref&gt;‘Indigenous Rights: Phillip Roberts’, National Museum of Australia website, http://www.nma.gov.au/indigenous/people/pagination/phillip_roberts, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilling, A. R. (1963), '‘I, the Aboriginal’, Douglas Lockwood', ''American Anthropologist'', 65: 1152–1153. doi: 10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00280&lt;/ref&gt; served on the Council from September 1970 until June 1972.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"&gt;Lambert 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in 1971 with a second Aboriginal Council member, [[Neville Bonner|Senator Neville Bonner]], who served on Council until 1974 and for a second term in the late 1970s. And again in 1972, with the appointment of [[Dick Roughsey]] to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"/&gt; But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Widders, Thompson, Bellear &amp; Watson (1974), ''Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies'', 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p107&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal rights movement was growing&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people.&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected. Their policy of [[Self-determination of Australian Aborigines|Self-determination for Aboriginal people]] echoed calls for greater Aboriginal involvement in the administration and functions of the AIAS.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, Mitchell &amp; Johnson, Murray, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines'', Scarecrow Press, Maryland, 2011, p xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;Pratt, Angela, 'Make or Break? A Background to the ATSIC Changes and the ATSIC Review', Parliament of Australia website, http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03cib29, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was also responsible for a significant boost to AIAS funding.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), Recording culture in transition, Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 52–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Peter Ucko in 1972 as Principal of the AIAS has since been described as the beginning of an increase in involvement of Aboriginal people in the workings of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary"&gt;Shennan, Stephen, ‘Peter Ucko Obituary’, The Guardian, 9 July 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In his time as Principal, Ucko was responsible for implementing a policy later labelled “Aboriginalisation”, which was aimed at opening up the Institute to Aboriginal involvement and representation.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995"&gt;Moser, Stephanie, ‘The Aboriginalisation of Archaeology’, in Ucko, Peter J (ed) Theory in Archaeology: A World Perspective, Routledge, London, 1995, p152&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was influenced by a document circulated in 1974, called the Eaglehawk and Crow letter, which criticised the current model of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, John (2011), Digging Up the Past, University of NSW Press, Sydney, p186&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted that anthropologists "should not pretend that their studies are objective when the overwhelming factor in the lives of Aborigines is our oppression by the society of which the anthropologist is, to a greater or lesser extent, a part of." Its authors called for increased participation of Aboriginal people in the running of the Institute and for greater control over commissioning and funding of research into their cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Widder, T et al, ''Open Letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, ''referred to as the "Eaglehawk and Crow letter", 29 March 1974, http://www.50yearjourney.aiatsis.gov.au/stage4/_media/eaglehawk_and_crow_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy and structural changes to the Institute continued throughout the 1970s.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995" /&gt; The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975–1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of ‘cultural practitioner’, travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of “rapid expansion”&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary" /&gt; for the Institute.

The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born [[ethnographic film]]maker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

During the MacDougall/McKenzie era, a new style of ethnographic film was explored.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO"&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One that moved away from film as a scientific record in favour of telling the story of individuals lives.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant ‘voice of god’ narration style.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was ''Waiting for Harry'', a prize-winning film&lt;ref&gt;‘'Waiting for Harry’', Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024103/https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry |date=29 November 2014 }}, retrieved 11 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Kim McKenzie with [[anthropologist]] [[Les Hiatt]] and now considered to exemplify the "style of collaborative filmmaking" the Film Unit favoured in their work.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;

The power of film to "influence opinion"&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic [[Marcia Langton]] expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] for his role in establishing the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The lecture is presented by prominent person with knowledge or experience relating to issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia today.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"/&gt;

The expansion of the Institute continued into the 1980s. The Aboriginal Studies Press began publishing the Australian Aboriginal Studies Journal in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Australian aboriginal studies: journal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Deaking University Library, http://encore.deakin.edu.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2865270, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed journal aimed at  “promoting high-quality research in Australian Indigenous studies.”&lt;ref name="ASJ"&gt;‘Australian Aboriginal Studies online’, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/australian-aboriginal-studies-journal, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the AIAS established a task force that identified the prevailing need for further ‘Aboriginalisation’ of the Institute’s workforce. At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p280&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

The ‘After 200 Years’ project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.&lt;ref name="After 200 Years"&gt;Taylor, Penny. The after 200 years photographic project [online].

The Rock Art Protection Program (RAPP) commenced in 1986 following a request for such an initiative by the then Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Clyde Holding]]. The aim of the RAPP was to protect Australian Indigenous rock art. Grants were approved by the Institute to fund various projects related to rock art protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ward. Graeme K, 'The role of AIATSIS in research and protection of Australian rock art', in: ''Rock Art Research''. Vol 28, no. 1 (May 2011), p 7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections were also expanding, and by 1987 the AIATSIS library encompassed the print collections, a special Bibliographic Section and the Resource Centre (which contained the Institute’s audiovisual materials).&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, the survival of the AIAS as an independent statutory body was tied to a proposal for a new statutory commission that would take over all aspects of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, pp288-308&lt;/ref&gt; This commission would become the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), conceived in an Act of Parliament in 1989.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kingsley, 'ATSIC: Origins and Issues for the Future’, A Critical Review of Public Domain Research and Other Materials, AIATSIS Research Discussion Paper # 12, 2004, p5, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/discussion_paper/palmerk-dp12-atsic-origins-issues-future-research.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The AIAS would not be folded into this commission; instead it would be recreated under a new Act with a new name.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===AIATSIS (1989–now)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Act was passed by parliament in 1989, replacing the AIAS Act.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/, retrieved 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The newly established AIATSIS had a reduced Council consisting of nine members,&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; with the AIATSIS Act specifying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold a minimum of five of these Council positions.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 12, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s12.html, retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical research===
{{quote|''"Indigenous people are also researchers, and all participants must be regarded as equal participants in a research engagement."''&lt;ref name=GERAIS&gt;Introduction, ''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011, p 4, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/ethics/gerais.pdf, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS).JPG|thumb|right|The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS)]]
[[File:Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015.JPG|thumb|right|Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015]]
AIATSIS publishes the Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (referred to as GERAIS),&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a document considered to be the leading ethics guidelines for conducting research in and with Indigenous communities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, ''Writing up Indigenous research: authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge systems'',Terri Janke and Co, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines consist of 14 principles. These principles broadly fit under the following themes:

*rights, respect and recognition
*negotiation, consultation, agreement and mutual understanding
*participation, collaboration and partnership
*benefits, outcomes and giving back
*managing research: use, storage and access, and
*reporting and compliance&lt;ref name="EthicsMedia"&gt;‘Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is required reading for researchers applying for Ethical Clearance for research sponsored by AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="EthicsApplication"&gt;‘Application process’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/application-process, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, Writing up Indigenous research:  authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge system, Terri Janke and Co, 2009, p15&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guidelines are also intended by AIATSIS to inform all research in the field of Indigenous studies.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;

Originally published by AIATSIS in 2000, the latest version of the GERAIS document was published in 2012. This update was made to reflect legal and technological developments that had occurred since original publication. In particular, in the area of intellectual property and the rights of Indigenous people in their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions as well as progress in digitisation technologies and data and information management.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=EthicsMedia /&gt;

These changes reflect AIATSIS’ support for the importance of research projects involving appropriate ethical conduct and rights protection for both the way data is collected during research and the findings and materials generated through that research.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. ''Bringing ethics up to date: a review of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ethical guidelines''. In: Australian Aboriginal Studies. no. 2,2010, p. 10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is the first point of reference in the ethical review process researchers must undergo before AIATSIS will sponsor a research project. All research projects are reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee for approval, using the following project documents:

*an ethical clearance proposal, using the GERAIS document as a guide,
*a plain English statement to explain to participants what the project is and how it will be conducted, and
*informed consent forms, that are completed by participants of the research.&lt;ref name=EthicsApplication /&gt;

In 2013, AIATSIS was involved in the review of two [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] research ethics guidelines relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research.&lt;ref&gt;'Evaluation of NHMRC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research Ethics', The Lowitja Institute website, http://www.lowitja.org.au/nhmrc-research-ethics, 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Title research===
AIATSIS began undertaking Native Title research activities through the Native Title Research Unit in 1993, following the 1992 [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]] [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] decision. Native Title research at AIATSIS is primarily funded through the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]&lt;ref name="NT main"&gt;'Native title and traditional ownership', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but research has also been conducted in partnership with other departments and organisations including the [[Australian National University]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Federal Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership partners', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/partners, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Title Research Advisory Committee, the Research Advisory Committee and the AIATSIS Council oversee the work conducted in Native Title and traditional ownership research at AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt;

AIATSIS conducts a range of research projects relating to Native Title and traditional ownership, including Native Title and cultural heritage, Native Title and fresh and sea water, and Prescribed Body Corporates.&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership current projects', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/current, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Native Title research at AIATSIS is to monitor outcomes of Native Title and through research and study, provide advice on Native Title policy development.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt; The Institute publishes a range of materials relating to Native Title including books, discussion papers, research reports and a Native Title Newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;‘About NTRU Publications’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title-and-traditional-ownership/native-title-and-traditional-ownership-resources-and-information-services, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Native Title Corporations’, http://www.nativetitle.org.au/research.html, retrieved 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also provides a Native Title Research and Access Officer, who is responsible for assisting Native Title claimants to access materials from the AIATSIS collections in support of their claim.&lt;ref&gt;‘Native Title collections services’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title-and-traditional-ownership/native-title-collections-services {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315004012/http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title-and-traditional-ownership/native-title-collections-services |date=15 March 2015 }}, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Overview===
AIATSIS is the only Commonwealth institution responsible for collecting and maintaining materials documenting the oral and visual traditions and histories of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; The Institute identifies its collection as a “keeping place for culturally significant objects” that is “a resource for anybody looking to improve their knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's holdings represent thousands of years of history and more than 500 Australian Indigenous languages, dialects and groups. This collection supports, and is a result of, research in the fields of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

An independent assessment in 2014 confirmed that AIATSIS holds over 6 million feet of film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; over 40,000 hours of audio, 12,800 unpublished manuscripts and record series, 653,000 photographs, and 120,000 print and published materials (3,000 of which are rare books) among other miscellanea.&lt;ref&gt;’50 years of culture and collections’, 15 December 2014, http://www.indigenous.gov.au/news-and-media/stories/50-years-culture-and-collections&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audiovisual Archives also holds copies of the first audio recorded in Australia;&lt;ref&gt;‘Musical Connections: The Life and Work of Alice Moyle, AIATSIS Online Exhibition, http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320123750/http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html |date=20 March 2015 }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a series of ethnographic wax cylinder recordings made in the Torres Strait Islands in 1898.  The Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Strait, led by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], recorded songs and speech from Mer/Murray Island, Mabuiag/Jervis Island, Saibai Island, Tudu Island and Iama/Yam Island.

The AIATSIS collection is housed and managed through the Library and the Audiovisual Archive,&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"&gt;Barbara Lewincamp &amp; Julie Faulkner (2003) 'A keyhole to the collection: the AIATSIS Library Digitisation Pilot Program’, ‘’The Australian Library Journal’’, 52:3, 239–245, DOI: 10.1080/00049670.2003.10721551&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadly categorised into the following groups:

'''Art and artefact:''' a collection of items including ritual objects, folk art, children’s art and modern or ‘high art’ and span from the late 19th century to the present day. This sub-collection comprises around 600 artworks and 500 artefacts, acquired either as a result of AIATSIS-sponsored field research or through donation or purchase.&lt;ref&gt;‘Art and artefacts’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/art-and-artefacts, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Books and printed material:''' a collection of books, pamphlets, serials including magazines and government reports, reference publications such as dictionaries and other published material.

'''Pictorial:''' this collection contains roughly 650,000 photographs that date from modern day as far back as the late 1800s, and more than 90% of images in the pictorial collection are unique to AIATSIS, making it the most comprehensive record of its kind relating to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictorial’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound:''' a collection of many unique and unpublished sound recordings totalling approximately 40,000 hours of audio. The recordings represent a breadth of cultural and historical information including languages, ceremonies, music, oral histories and interviews with participants in significant events such as the 1965 Freedom Rides and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s Apology to the Stolen Generations.&lt;ref&gt;‘Sound’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/sound, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items.

AIATSIS’ approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria:

:1.	Comprehensiveness – the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. 
:2.	Significance – items that meet this criteria are considered to make ‘a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge’, reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS’ own history. 
:3.	Representativeness – when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are ‘representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.’&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

===Collection management===
Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting.

Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways:

:1.	Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013–2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management-plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
:2.	Storage of collection items in climate-controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.&lt;ref&gt;‘Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.&lt;ref name="Caring collection"&gt;‘Caring for the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning.jpg|thumb|An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning]]Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records’, Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May-June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Electronic Records – Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria’, VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure.

The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.&lt;ref&gt;‘Using the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its founding Act,&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN).&lt;ref name="ATSILIRN" /&gt; Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.&lt;ref name="CAUP"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digitisation program===
AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution.&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"/&gt;

Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan,&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt; but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnsley, Warren, 'AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still "inadequate"', '’National Indigenous Radio Service'’, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding-welcome-but-still-inadequate.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raggatt, Matthew, ‘Historic indigenous collection in "severe and catastrophic state"’, ‘’The Canberra Times’’, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection-in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caring collection" /&gt; One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

===Access to the collection===
[[File:Library stacks at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra ACT Australia.tif|thumb|left|Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia]]
The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters.

Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.&lt;ref&gt;'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations  to access.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating “remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities” as well as for access by researchers and the general public.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS’ digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.&lt;ref&gt;‘Return of materials to Indigenous communities’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous-communities, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also makes the collection available through a series of online exhibitions and digitised collection material published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;‘Collections online’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-onlinel{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These showcase different themes or discrete collections of material, including:

Access to the AIATSIS collection is also dictated by legislation governing the Institute and in some instances by legal agreements outlining the terms under which collection materials can be used.

The terms for access to the AIATSIS collection are in the first instance set by the AIATSIS Act, Section 41. This section states:

:1.	"Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions.
:2.	The Institute or the Council shall not disclose information or other matter held by it (including information or other matter covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders."&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions referred to in Section 41(1) of the AIATSIS Act are usually covered in the agreement that AIATSIS enters into when material is deposited. These agreements, along with the section 41(2) of the Act, can govern the way that unpublished material can be accessed and used.&lt;ref name=CAUP /&gt;

Access to and use of material in the AIATSIS collection is also subject to the terms set out in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act (1968)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ordering collection items', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/ordering-collection-items, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When a donation or deposit is being made, AIATSIS requests to be made aware of any sensitive items included in the material.&lt;ref&gt;‘Donate to the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/donate-collection, retrieved 12  March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The secret or sacred nature of information contained in many collection items is an important factor in access to the AIATSIS collection. To protect items of high cultural sensitivity and reflect appropriate cultural values, access to items that contain culturally sensitive information are restricted to groups or individuals who have the permission of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and the depositor if restrictions have been applied by them.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 7, 9, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also acknowledges the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and in particular Article 31's recognition of the right of Indigenous people to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations, 2000, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these complex issues AIATSIS developed an overarching Access and Use Policy in 2014, to “manage legal and cultural rights over material while maximising accessibility.”&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2013-2014, p42, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/aiatsis-annual-report-2013-2014, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection resources===
Since its inception, AIATSIS has developed and maintained a range of resources to enhance discoverability of the collection.

One of the most significant of these resources is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index (ABI). The ABI had its beginnings in 1979 as a non-selective biographical register of names, constructed using information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from published material in the collection. In the early years of the biographical register, it was hoped it could “provide an important record of the achievements of Aboriginal people, and be a source of pride for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Laurie and Barwick, Diane. Beginning a national Aboriginal biographical register at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Aboriginal history. Vol. 6 pt. 2, 1982. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the index continues to be updated, now containing over 70,000 records and searchable online through AIATSIS’ collection catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/guides-and-resources/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-biographical-index, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other resources available on site include the Perfect Pictures Database, which contains over 140,000 digitised images from the AIATSIS Photographic Collection. This database is added to as more images are digitised and only includes images that are free of secret/sacred access restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictures database’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial/pictures-database, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also hosts or contributes to a number of online resources, aimed at facilitating access to and understanding of the collection. These include:

*'''Mura''' – this is AIATSIS’ collection catalogue, which can be searched online.&lt;ref&gt;‘Search the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/search-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trove''' – the AIATSIS collection can be searched through the National Library of Australia’s Trove.&lt;ref&gt;‘Introduction to Trove’ video, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/guides-and-resources/Tutorial-Introduction-to-Trove.swf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS uses this platform as a means to further enhancing discoverability of and access to its collections.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Agency resources and planned performance’’, Department of Industry and Science website, http://www.industry.gov.au/AboutUs/Budget/Documents/PortfolioBudgetStatementsAIATSIS2011-12.pdf, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thesauri''' – there are three Thesauri that AIATSIS have created and make available through their website. These relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, place names and subject areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Pathways: Gateway to the AIATSIS Thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/thesaurus/language/language.asp, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Library of Congress has approved these thesauri for use in bibliographic records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pathways thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/pathways-thesauri, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the Institute==
[[File:Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra 2007.JPG|thumb|The west wing of the AIATSIS building designed by [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]], is a black replica of [[Le Corbusier]]'s iconic [[Villa Savoye]]]]

AIATSIS is located on the [[Acton Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;'Contact us', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/get-involved/contact-us, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a building that was newly built for the Institute and opened in 2001. The building was officially opened by the Honourable [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] and [[Ken Colbung|Mr Ken Colbung]]. As part of the opening the [[Ngunnawal people]], the traditional owners of the land on which the AIATSIS building stands performed a [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|Welcome to Country]] and [[smoking ceremony]], and the Anbarra people from North Central Arnhem Land performed a friendship ceremony, known as Rom.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"&gt;'AIATSIS finds a home', The Koori Mail, Issue 261, Wednesday 3 October 2001, p10, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/koori-mail/koori-mail-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, [[Howard Raggatt|Howard Ragatt]] of the firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall designed the building for AIATSIS and for its neighbour on the Acton Peninsula, the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p191&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $13.75 million and was funded by the Commonwealth Government’s Centenary of Federation Grants Program.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"/&gt;

The design of the AIATSIS building has been the subject of differing interpretations. The rear of the building has been described as a black copy of pioneer architect [[Le Corbusier]]'s 1920's [[Villa Savoye]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;'The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p198&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Howard Raggatt, was quoted as confirming this influence&lt;ref&gt;“Letters and Fixes: NMA, AIATSIS and Consultation”, Architecture Australia website, http://architectureau.com/articles/letters-and-fixes-6/, retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that it is designed to be reminiscent of [[Sidney Nolan]]'s famous paintings of Ned Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Dimitry (ed), National Museum of Australia: Tangled Destinies, Images Publishing, Victoria, 2002, p66&lt;/ref&gt;

During design of the AIATSIS building, it was reoriented from original plans to save two [[Eucalyptus bridgesiana|Apple Box trees]] that were identified as significant to the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Report relating to the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Parliament of Australia, 1998, p64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Baby sign involves enhanced gestures and altered signs that infants are taught in conjunction with spoken words with the intention of creating richer parent-child communication.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The main reason that parents use baby sign is with hope that it will reduce the frustration involved in trying to interpret their pre-verbal child's needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howlett|first=N.|last2=Kirk|first2=E.|last3=Pine|first3=K.J.|date=2011|title=Does wanting the best create more stress?

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Baby sign is distinct from [[sign language]]. Baby sign is used by hearing parents with hearing children to improve communication.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doherty-Sneddon|first=G.|date=2008|title=The great baby signing debate|url=|journal=The Psychologist|volume=21|issue=4|pages=300–303|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sign languages, including [[American Sign Language|ASL]], [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Italian Sign Language|ISL]] and others, are natural languages, typically used in the Deaf community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sign languages maintain their own [[grammar]], and [[sentence structure]].&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Baby Sign Language|last=Porpora|first=T|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Group Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60138-393-8|location=Ocala:Florida|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sign languages are as complex to learn as any [[spoken language]], simplified signs are often used with infants in baby sign.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capone|first=N. C.|last2=McGregor|first2=K.K.|date=2004|title=Gesture development: A review for clinical and research practices|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00617908/document|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Practices|volume=47|doi=10.1044/1092-4388|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Teaching baby signs allows for greater flexibility in the form of sign and does not require the parent to learn the grammar of a sign language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Baby signs are usually gestures or signs taken from the sign language community and modified to make them easier for an infant to form.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

It is common for the difference between symbolic [[gesture]]s and baby signs to be mistaken. [[Gestures in language acquisition|Symbolic gestures]] are a form of communication that children adopt before they develop the ability to produce spoken language.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This includes pointing to what they want or using a hand motion in conjunction with a word which allows greater communication for infants. Infants from about six months of age can begin to learn the basic signs, which cover such objects and concepts as “thirsty,” “milk,” “water,” “hungry,” “sleepy,” “pacifier,” “more,” “hot,” “cold,” “play,” “bath,” and “teddy bear.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/teaching-your-baby-sign-language-can-benefit-both-of-you/|title=Teaching Your Baby Sign Language Can Benefit Both of You {{!}} Psych Central|date=2016-05-17|work=Psych Central|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, developing children will produce their first gestures between the ages of 9 and 12 months without any prompting or assistance from a caregiver. Infants learn how to use their [[body language]], [[eye gaze]], and [[hand gestures]] as a way to attract attention and communicate. Once children gain some language production, they will couple language with gesture to further communicate.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Gesture remains present in all individuals at any age which is a distinguishing factor from baby sign.

==Pros and cons==
===Suggested benefits===
Baby sign promotes communication before a child is able to verbally communicate with others.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=J. C.|last2=Durieux-Smith|first2=A.|last3=Bloom|first3=K.|date=2005|title=Teaching gestural signs to infants to advance child development: A review of evidence|url=|journal=First Language|volume=25|issue=2|doi=10.1177/0142723705050340|pmid=|access-date=|pages=235–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since gestures are part of normal speech, teaching baby sign allows infants to learn an aspect of communication that is used with language. It is not, however designed to replace language.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/development/stimulatingdevelopment/babysigning/#4|title=Baby Signing|date=September 2014|access-date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to any teaching of signs by adults, children will gesture while making [[babbling]] sounds or without babbling. They will not however, during infancy, babble without making a gesture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This demonstrates that infants are able to learn gestures before mastering verbal skills.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Therefore, those who learn these simplified signs may enhance their [[cognitive development]] by gaining language skills through both visual and auditory modes.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniels|first=M.|date=1994|title=The effect of sign language on hearing children's language development|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=43|pages=291–298|doi=10.1080/03634529409378987|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in ''The Psychologist,'' Gwyneth Doherty-Sneddon has considered in detail the theory behind the growth of this phenomenon and some of the claims made by its supporters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Doherty-Sneddon points out that baby sign is not entirely new.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Variations have been used by speech and language therapists for decades with children who have impairments to either their speech, cognitive abilities, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clibbens |last2=Powell |last3=Atkinson |first=J. |first2=G. G. |first3=E. |date=2002|title=Strategies for achieving joint attention when signing to children with Down's syndrome.|url=|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|pages=309–323|doi=10.1080/13682820210136287|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recognized that communication is at the heart of cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral development in children. Baby sign may assist in improving these significant developmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|last=Vygotsky|first=L. S.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baby signs create mutual attention between the parent and child leading to further elaboration of what the infant is communicating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A study collected self reports from mothers, who engaged in a baby sign training workshop, to clarify whether or not signing with their child would create added parental stress and/or enhance parent-child communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall the parents did not express feeling heightened stress or frustration from the baby sign training process but rather they reported a greater ability to understand their child. This richer [[communication]] was found to lead to a more positive interaction with their child which overall benefits the establishment of an earlier parent-child bond.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller Sepulveda|first=V.|last2=Sepulveda|first2=A.|date=2013|title=Parental perception of a baby sign workshop on stress and parent- child interaction|url=|journal=Early Child Development and Care|doi=10.1080/03004430.2013.797899|pmid=|access-date=|volume=184|pages=450–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Children who learned enhanced symbolic gestures performed better on both expressive and receptive verbal language tests compared to those who had not been encouraged to learn such gestures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Receptive language]] means being able to recognize words and signs, while [[expressive language]] involves the process of forming words or signs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Research has shown that enhanced gesture input for hearing children is the first step toward successfully mastering gesture use, and the use of representational form and symbolic communicative function.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Improved symbolic gestures may contribute to language development by providing children with increased knowledge of concepts by explaining the functions of the objects that they are exposed to.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In support of expressive language development studies have shown that learning symbolic gestures can lead to advanced verbal development and accelerated language acquisition.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An effective baby sign workshop also resulted in the improvement of numerous areas of development by comparing the child's results before and after the workshop.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=V.|last2=Sepulveda|first2=A.|last3=Rodriguez|first3=S.|date=2014|title=The effects of baby sign training on development|url=|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=184|issue=8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these areas included communicative, cognitive, social, adaptive behavior, physical, and fine motor skill development of children.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This enhancement however, is short-lived (from between 12 and 15 months of age).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Doherty-Sneddon argues, however, that this timescale represents only a general norm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The enhancement and advantage is far more extended in the many toddlers who do not speak until well after their second birthdays.

Doherty-Sneddon also states a key issue is ensuring that sufficient and appropriately designed research is available to back the claims made in relation to baby signing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A literature review concluded that although benefits were reported in 13 of 17 studies, various weaknesses in the methods used for baby sign studies leave the evidence unsupported.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston |last2=Durieux-Smith |last3=Bloom |first=J. C. |first2=A. |first3=K.|date=2005|title=teaching gestural signs to infants to advance child development: A review of the evidence.|url=|journal=First Language|volume=25|issue=2|pages=235–251|doi=10.1177/0142723705050340|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly, research into the effects of baby signing needs better control groups, such as children who are involved in equally interesting and fun activities based around adult and child language interaction, but not baby signing. This suggestion for further research implies that it may not be the baby signs themselves that facilitate language development but rather the underlying benefit being active, [[joint attention]] that is stimulated by baby sign.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clibben|first=J.|last2=Powell|first2=G. G.|last3=Atkinson|first3=E.|date=2002|title=Strategies for achieving joint attention when signing to children with Down's syndrome|url=|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|doi=10.1080/1368282021013628|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the enhanced joint visual attention during parent-child interaction empowers the infant to focus the topic and context of the conversation, clarify concepts, and creates added practice with symbolic interaction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwyn |last2=Acredolo |last3=Brown |first=S |first2=L |first3=C. A.|date=2000|title=Impact of symbolic gesturing on early language development.|url=|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=24|issue=2|pages=81–103|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These underlying mechanisms of baby sign are proposed to create benefits for the infant such as; enhancing vocabulary, advancing cognitive development, reducing tantrums and frustration, and improving the parent-child relationship and communication. More specifically language development is improved by advancing comprehension, promoting [[literacy]] and successfully allowing the infant to express their needs so the parent becomes more responsive and observant of their baby.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child psychology|last=Balter |last2=Tamis-LeMonda|first=L |first2=C|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=116–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Why it may be neither beneficial nor harmful ===
Researchers have suggested the possibility of parents and experimenters being overly liberal in attributing sign or word status to early attempts at communication by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettito|first=Laura A.|title="Language" in the pre-linguistic child. The development of language and language researchers|year=1988|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=187–221|editor=Frank S. Kessel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puccini and Liszkowski found that when infants associate labels with objects, they use verbal cues more frequently than gestures to make these associations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Puccini | first1 = D. | last2 = Liszkowski | first2 = U. | year = 2012 | title = 15-month-old infants fast map words but not representational gestures of multimodal labels | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 101 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of further facilitating gesturing with baby signs is suggested to possibly cause interference toward children's mapping of these words. This may be a result of infants lacking enough attention to take in these two types of information and process it at the same time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is suggested that these labels, and further through the facilitation of baby sign, that it is unlikely that baby sign is facilitating speech development in infants.

Baby sign programs encourage parents to improve their communication skills between themselves and their infants before they have developed speech.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Kirk and colleagues have found that the results of their study with hearing infants provided no evidence to support that a child’s [[language development]] would benefit from learning baby sign. They also found that children who participated in baby sign had similar language development to children who did not learn baby sign. It is suggested that participating in baby sign may be an unnecessary effort with infants when being motivated by the hopes of advanced language learning for the child. However, it was found that mothers who used baby sign with their infants encouraged increased independence with them and supported a higher level of independence for their child.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another conducted research study has shown that there are no significant differences found with language acquisition between infants who are receiving or not receiving exposure to baby sign, including reaching language milestones&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seal |last2=DePaolis |first=B. C. |first2= R. A.|date=2014|title=Manual activity and onset of first words in babies exposed and not exposed to baby signing|url=|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=14|issue=4|pages=444–465|doi=10.1353/sls.2014.0015|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no support for using baby sign was found in this study, there was also no negative effects found to be associated with language development when using baby sign with your child. It is possible that baby sign is working in support of infant's spoken language, but was not found to further their later language development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The results of multiple studies regarding baby sign have found that the advantages provided do not go beyond children over the age of two years old.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The results of this literature review have not shown support that baby sign increases a child's linguistic development. When teaching a child baby sign, an infant's attention is directed away from what they are interested in and is redirected towards the adult and the desired sign. This interaction has been claimed to increase joint attention between parent and child, but has yet to be studied enough in research literature.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; It has also been proposed by researchers that baby sign may increase parental stress rather than decrease it because of busy lifestyles that may be disrupting interactions between parents and children. Teaching baby sign outside of research settings does not allow for the parent to raise questions or concerns to trained individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reaching fundamental linguistic milestones and the natural course of children's language development has been suggested to be disrupted because of the unnatural intervention in language development that baby sign provides, supported by the lack of support in prior studies which have been analyzed.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Learning baby sign==
There are numerous concepts to keep in mind when encouraging baby sign. Caregivers should ensure that they have their infant's attention, maintain consistency with what sign is used and how it is used in relation to an item, repeat signs often, encourage the infant, and be alert to recognize when the infant is signing back.

When it comes to infants who have not yet acquired language abilities, signs are an easy and readily accessible form of communication.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.uwstout.edu/content/lib/thesis/2009/2009cesafskym.pdf|title=Baby sign language: Hindering or enhancing communication in infants and toddlers?|last=Cesafsky|first=M. J.|date=2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to infants learning specific signs or developing language skills, they acquire the spontaneous use of [[Gestures in language acquisition|gesture]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  An infant’s first gesture may appear between 9–12 months of age, often classified as pointing. Gesturing gradually increases as infants connect pointing to word meaning, making a gesture-plus-word combination that will evolve into a two word combination.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is thought that gestures may be easier for infants to remember than a name alone since a gesture is representative of what the child can picture happening, when thinking about the item.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

To determine how infant communication is influenced by [[Gestures in language acquisition|gesture and speech]], Iverson and Goldin-Meadow conducted a study.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Infants in the study used eye gaze, body position, and vocalization to attract and direct their target audience's attention, while gesturing to items. Results looked to see if the gestures that children use are related to the word they say while doing the gesture. Iverson and Goldin-Meadow found that infants gesture for items that they did not have the ability to express with words. When words were produced by the child, they typically were ones that the child had already been gesturing for. This shows that gesture is directly linked to the words that children will produce.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Gestures in language acquisition|Symbolic gesture]] is the specific term that encompasses baby sign. This form of gesture aids in communication through the use of hand movements that represent an item or feeling.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gongora|first=X|last2=Chamarrita|first2=F|date=2009|title=Infant sign language program effects on synchronic mother-infant interactions|url=|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=32|pages=216–225|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2008.12.011|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are quick to note if there is a connection between an item and a symbolic gesture. Once they make the connection infants will imitate actions that are produced by the caregiver. Consistency from the caregiver is crucial during the teaching and feedback stage in order for infants to learn from repetition.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This repetition applies to how the caregiver uses the sign and in what way the sign is associated with the object or emotion. If the association changes then the child will have a harder time understanding how the symbolic gesture links to the item. One way for caregivers to ensure the infant associates the symbolic gesture with the object or emotion is to gain the infant's attention, and say the name of the object at the same time that the sign is performed.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Infants watch their caregiver during everyday routines and situations. This observation allows infants to learn symbols by borrowing the actions from the observed routine.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A natural association occurs between signs and items, allowing infants to explore and express new ideas prior to language development. Infants will learn to associate a word with the general motion that they carry out while using an object, such as throwing a ball. After this association children begin to make connections with the word and motion alone, in this case a throwing gesture. Infants now can make the throwing gesture to alert caregivers that they wish to throw a ball, thus increasing their non-verbal communication. Representative abilities such as these are further used by infants to demonstrate emotional feelings as they associate a motion or sign with a feeling.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Further studies demonstrate that increasing the use of gesture, not necessarily use of a sign language, can increase the richness of a child's linguistic development.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  It is suggested that learning signs happens over a period of time, inferring the importance of caregivers being patient with children as it takes more than a brief interaction between parent and child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonvillian|first=J. D.|last2=Siedlecki|first2=T.|date=2000|title=Young children’s acquisition of the formational aspects of American Sign Language: Parental report findings.|url=|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=45–64|doi=10.1353/sls.2000.0002|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parent-child interactions are vital to the learning of baby sign since the infant looks to the caregiver for guidance. By consciously demonstrating the sign to the infant, the caregiver and infant are sustaining [[joint attention]] which increases communication. When caregivers aid infants in creating the sign with their hands, they are further increasing encouragement, repetition, and communication.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; It is the caregiver’s job to not only teach specific hand signals, beyond what infants naturally pick up, but to provide support and feedback to infants when signs are produced correctly.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Through making a connection, and parental encouragement of that connection, infants can learn and actively engage in baby sign language.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In 1998, a program was conducted at A. Sophie Rogers Infant-Toddler Laboratory School in Ohio State University by Kimberlee Whaley. Infants as young as 9 months old and their teachers began to learn to use some signs from American Sign Language to communicate with each other effectively. The program found that children would use the signs they learned in the classroom at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/signlang.htm|title=Infants Use Sign Language to Communicate At Ohio State School|last=Grabmeier|first=Jeff|date=25 January 1999|publisher=[[The Ohio State University]]|accessdate=2 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614041005/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/signlang.htm|archivedate=14 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this study, learning baby sign appears to be a beneficial tool for children if implemented in schools and day cares.

==Media and Internet influences==
Due to promotional products, easy access to baby sign tutorial videos, and representations in popular culture parental attempts at signing with their baby may be more focused on the social fad instead of an intention to potentially enhance their child's communication skills.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pizer |last2=Walters |last3=Meier|first=G. |first2=K. |first3=R.|date=2007|title=Bringing up a baby with baby sign: Language ideologies and socialization in hearing families|url=|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=7|issue=4|pages=387–430|doi=10.1353/sls.2007.0026|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study examined the degree to which information about baby sign found on the internet was based on research.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Results found thirty-three websites that all promoted baby sign and the benefits associated. Over 90% of the information referred to opinion articles or promotional products encouraging parents to sign, with little to no basis in research. Although websites claim that using baby sign will reduce tantrums, increase infant’s self-esteem, satisfaction, feelings of accomplishment, increase parent-child bonding, and decrease frustration, the sites do not provide enough research-based evidence to support these claims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=L. H.|last2=White|first2=K. R.|last3=Grewe|first3=J.|date=2012|title=Evidence for website claims about the benefits of teaching sign language to infants and toddlers with normal hearing.|url=|journal=Infant and Child Development|volume=21|pages=474–502|doi=10.1002/icd.1748|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study examined internet information found using Google Scholar as well as a few academic databases. Researchers examined whether results claimed baby sign encouraged developmental, social, cognitive, and language skills while achieving a greater bond between parent and child.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick |last2=Thibert |last3=Grandpierre |last4=Johnston|first=E. M |first2=J |first3=V |first4=J. C|date=2014|title=How handy are baby signs? A systematic review of the impact of gestural communication on typically developing, hearing infants under the age of 36 months|url=|journal=First Language|volume=34|issue=6|pages=486–509|doi=10.1177/0142723714562864|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of asking this question was to find information that allows parents, caregivers, childhood educators, and clinicians to make informed decisions about the amount of emphasis to place on baby sign. When all the cited material was gathered there were 1747 articles with only 10 articles providing research regarding infant's developmental outcome in connection to baby sign.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Consensus gathered from these 10 articles states that baby sign, as used by the commercially advertised product authored by Acredolo and Goodwyn, does not benefit language production or parent-child relationships. However, there is also no evidence from these articles that baby sign is in any way harmful to infants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Through these two studies it is illustrated that websites may not contain 100% research based information. Individuals looking for information regarding the pros and cons of using baby sign should ensure they are accessing sites backed by research and not opinion.

Commercial products available to parents participating in baby sign workshops or implementing it at home, are found to be comparable to the quality of products used in research studies.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; It is suggested that parents be cautious of baby sign products as it is difficult to tell the credibility of commercialized products for facilitating baby sign with your child.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Drs. Linda Acredolo and Susan Goodwyn produced books, such as ''Baby Signs: How to Talk with Your Baby Before Your Baby Can Talk'' which was published in 2009, that greatly influenced the baby sign movement, by providing guidance, suggestions, and information to caregivers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Acredolo and Goodwyn's book is not the only one dominating the baby sign industry. ''Essential Baby Sign Language'', a relatively short book written by Teresa Simpson, explains why a caregiver may want to sign with their child, how to start signing, and the best strategies to achieve success. Simpson explains 75 common signs in this book but has other books that are for the more advanced signer, and provide numerous different signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Baby Sign Language|last=Simpson|first=T. R.|publisher=Adams Media|year=2013|isbn=978-1-59869-883-1|location=Avon: Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preschool teacher named Karyn Warbuton used baby sign with her daughter and incorporated it into her work with infants, children who spoke English as a second language, and special needs children. ''Baby Sign Language for Hearing Babies'', is one book that explains the type of workshops that Warburton runs with her students, and includes a dictionary of baby signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baby Sign Language for Hearing Babies|last=Warburton|first=K.|publisher=Penguin|year=2006|isbn=0-399-53260-9|location=New York: New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar style of providing guidance, and structure to caregivers at home signing, Monta Z. Briant has published different baby sign books as well as a website. One of her books, ''Baby Sign Language Basics: Early Communication for Hearing Babies and Toddlers'', explains how to start signing, when is a good time to begin, how to optimize the experience, and what limits should be set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baby Sign Language Basics: Early Communication for Hearing Babies and Toddlers|last=Briant|first=M. Z.|publisher=Hay House Incorporated|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4019-2159-0|location=New York: New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Complete Guide to Baby Sign Language: 101 Tips and Tricks Every Parent Needs to Know'', a book by Tracy Porpora, some differences between baby sign and sign language are discussed. As in most products aimed at aiding caregivers, there are pictures to illustrate how specific signs look when done according to the guidelines in the book.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; These are just a few books that are accessible on the specific topic of teaching baby sign to infants and by no means an exhaustive list.

Pedagogical tools for teaching articulatory setting. In M. J. Solé &amp; D. Recasens (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 15th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences''. 1603–1606.

Different languages each have their own basis of articulation, which means that native speakers will share a certain position of tongue, lips, jaw, possibly even uvula or larynx, when preparing to speak. These standard settings enable them to produce the sounds and prosody of their native language more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Celce-Murcia, D. Brinton and J. Goodwin (1996) ''Teaching Pronunciation'', Cambridge University Press pp 27-8&lt;/ref&gt; Honikman suggests thinking of it in terms of having a "gear" for English, another for French, and so on depending on which language is being learned; in the classroom, when working on pronunciation, the first thing the learner must do is to think themselves into the right gear before starting on pronunciation exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Honikman, B. (1964) 'Articulatory Settings' in ''In Honour of Daniel Jones'', eds. D. Abercrombie et al, Longman, pp 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner (2001) gives a detailed account of how this idea arose and how Honikman has been credited with its invention despite a considerable history of prior study.&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, B. (2001) 'Articulatory setting:genealogies of an idea', ''Historiographia Linguistica'' 28:121-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Different accents within a given language may have their own characteristic basis of articulation, resulting in one accent being perceived as, e.g., more 'nasal', 'velarized' or 'guttural' than another. According to Cruttenden, "The articulatory setting of a language or dialect may differ from GB [General British]. So some languages like Spanish may have a tendency to hold the tongue more forward in the mouth, while others like Russian may have a tendency to hold it further back in the mouth. Nasalization may be characteristic of many speakers of American English, while denasal voice ... is frequently said to occur in Liverpool".&lt;ref&gt;Cruttenden, A. (2014) ''Gimson's Pronunciation of English'', Routledge, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed exposition can be read in Gili Gaya (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gili Gaya|first=Samuel|year=1956|chapter=Base de articulación|title=Elementos de fonética general|edition=5th|language=Spanish|location=Madrid|publisher=Editorial Gredos}} [http://www.peterroach.net/basis-of-articulation.html English translation] by Emilio Márquez.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native speakers typically find the basis of articulation one of the greatest challenges in acquiring a foreign language's pronunciation. Speaking with the basis of articulation of their own native language results in a foreign accent, even if the individual sounds of the target language are produced correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messum|first=Piers|year=2010|title=Understanding and teaching the English articulatory setting|journal=Speak Out! (IATEFL Pronunciation Special Interest Group Newsletter)|issue=43|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Basis of articulation'' is used in a slightly different sense to refer to a hypothesized articulatory "baseline" which is neutral in respect of individual vowels and consonants. This is done in the phonetic framework section of Chomsky and Halle (1968) for the purposes of explaining various distinctive features in terms of their deviation from the neutral position.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. (1968) ''The Sound Pattern of English''&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Odden has written "...some features are characterized in terms of the 'neutral position' which is a configuration that the vocal tract is assumed to have immediately prior to speaking. The neutral position, approximately that of the vowel [ɛ], defines relative movement of the tongue”&lt;ref&gt;Odden, D. (2005) ''Introducing Phonology'', Cambridge University Press, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if this should be taken to refer only to English.

==History==

One of the first researchers on the subject of bilingual memory and representation was [[linguist]] [[Uriel Weinreich]]. ''Languages in Contact'', an essay published by Weinreich in 1953, proposed a model of bilingual memory organization that made the theoretical distinction between the [[lexical semantics|lexical]] and conceptual level of representation.&lt;ref name=Golato&gt;Golato, P. (2007). The handbook of bilingualism. ''World Englishes, 26'', 534–536. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-971X.2007.00527.x&lt;/ref&gt; Three different types of organizational models were proposed: coordinate, compound, and subordinate, each having a different relationship between the lexical and conceptual levels of representation.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; In 1954, Ervin and Osgood reformulated Weinreich's compound-coordinate representational model and placed further emphasis on the context of language learning, similar to the [[encoding specificity principle]] later proposed by [[Tulving]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; In 1984, Potter et al. proposed the hierarchical model of bilingual memory, consisting of two memory structures, the word association model and concept mediation model. The word association model proposes a link between languages at the lexical level while the concept mediation model proposes a direct link between the conceptual representation and the lexical representation in each language.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; The hierarchical model was later revised by Kroll and Stewart in 1994 to account for linguistic proficiency and direction of translation, since then it has been re-revised.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;

==Biological basis of bilingual memories==

One of the processes involved in analyzing which neural regions of the brain are involved in bilingual memory is a subtraction method. Researchers compare what has been impaired with what is functioning regularly. This contrast between the destroyed and intact regions of the brain, aids researchers in discovering the components of language processing. It has been found that under typical circumstances, when multiple languages are lost at the same time, they are usually regained in the same fashion. It is therefore presumed that areas of the brain, which are responsible for processing language, are potentially the same. There have been examples of cases where languages have been restored prior to one another and to a greater degree, but this is fairly uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Goral, M., Levy, E., &amp; Obler, L. (2002) Neurolinguistic aspects of bilingualism. ''International Journal of Bilingualism, 6''(4), 411-420. doi:10.1177/13670069020060040301&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques allowing researchers to observe brain activity in multilingual patients are conducted whilst the subject is simultaneously performing and processing a language. Research has proposed that the entire production and comprehension of language is most likely regulated and managed by neural pools, whose stations of communication are in the cortical and subcortical regions.&lt;ref name=Moretti&gt;Moretti, R., Torre, P., Antonello, R. M., Cazzato, G., &amp; Bava, A. (2003). Subcortical-cortical lesions and two-step aphasia in a bilingual patient. ''Advances in psychology research, 23'', 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that there are no grounds on which to assume the existence of distinct cerebral organization of separate languages in the bilingual brain. That is to say, the cerebral regions that are engaged for both languages are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Marangolo, P., Peran, P., Piras, F., Rizzi, C., &amp; Sabatini, U. (2009). Parallel recovery in a bilingual aphasic: a neurolinguistic and fMRI study. ''Neuropsychology, 23''(3), 405-409. doi:10.1037/a0014824&lt;/ref&gt; Although neurologists have a basic understanding of the underlying neural components and mechanisms of bilingual language, further research is necessary in order to fully understand or conclude any other findings.&lt;ref name=Moretti /&gt; 
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|alt=MRI|Anterior Cingulate]][[Neuroimaging]] techniques such as [[fMRI]]s have shown that at least four brain areas are involved in bilingual switching: [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], inferior frontal cortex, [[anterior cingulate]], and [[supramarginal gyrus]]. It is expected that switching from one language to another should involve different functional processes when compared to the brain of an individual who only speaks one language. However further studies on brain activation during this switching of languages needs to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Baker. S. A., Kovelman, I., &amp; Petitto, L. (2008). Bilingual and monolingual brains compared: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of syntactic processing and a possible "neural signature" of bilingualism. ''J Cogn Neurosci, 20''(1): 153–169. doi: 10.1162/jocn.2008.20011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual episodic memory==
[[Episodic memory]] is closely related to [[semantic memory]], [[Tulving]] created the two categories as a way to distinguish the specific knowledge from the general knowledge. Episodic memory contains the records of unique events which occurred at particular times,&lt;ref name=Macleod&gt;Macleod, C. M. (1976). Bilingual episodic memory: acquisition and forgetting. ''Journal of  Verbal Learning and Verbal Behaviour, 15'', 347-364.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly Autobiographical memories are stored in episodic memory.  It holds the events from personally experienced past,&lt;ref name= Schrauf&gt;Schrauf, R.W., Pavlenko, A. &amp; Dewaele J.-M. (2003) Bilingual episodic memory: An introduction. ''The International Journal of Bilingualism'', ''7''(3), 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; they exist in subjective time and space and using it requires a conscious recollection and a controlled process.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Tulving referred to this as "mental time travel",&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and he "classifies encoding as an event, rather than a process".&lt;ref name =Murray&gt;Murray, D. (1985). Review of elements of episodic memory. ''Canadian Psychology, 26''(3), 235-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested that bilinguals that have better control of their language processing should perform better in episodic than semantic memory tasks.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Bilinguals store the input of language exceedingly well, regardless of their intention to learn.&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; Language forms a surface in the progressive retrieval of features of an event (e.g., on College Ave, at Tim Hortons, on Tuesday...), that triggers further forms within the same language serving to guide retrieval. The events, objects, characters, etc. are all cued by linguistic elements that might serve as a series of triggers.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; This information is highly integrated, the superiority of action memory is due to better episodic integration for action memory (vs verbal);&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; we remember events based on language cues and these cues further solidify the events.

To test episodic memory researchers usually use items that can be better related to normal everyday life, such as sentences.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;  Language recognition depends somewhat on the retrievability of meaning, but the extent of this dependence is unknown. Retrieval of memories is language-specific, it matches the language spoken at the time. Depending on what language is used what is recalled may be different because a cue can activate many meanings, it is the context that conditions what meaning is considered first,&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and context can change over language and cultures.

Bilinguals also tend to be [[bicultural]], it is known that we filter all of our experiences through culturally shaped scripts. So, those that are bilingual and therefore for the most part bicultural have multiple scripts to draw from, or more than one set of narrative constraints. All experiences imply some sort of narrative structure, and narrative traditions are culturally shaped. They direct our perception of reality and the encoding of memories. Though they may not directly determine their perception of reality, they determine "how the story is told" which may be different from "how it happened".&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; This shapes memory, as stories that are deemed as worthy to be told are further solidified by the retelling and reliving of the experience.

===Bilingual autobiographical memory===

[[Autobiographical memory]] is a type of [[Episodic memory]] process which is involved in the recall of one's life experiences and personal events of ones past.&lt;ref name= Golato/&gt; Bilinguals have the ability to recall some life experiences in one language, and other events using another. When recalling language information it is important that the language is recalled in the same [[context (language use)|context]] as it was encoded. This is referred to as [[Context-dependent memory]] Ex. If one who is bilingual were to learn a Spanish song in a Spanish speaking country, and then come back to their native land, they would have difficulty remembering the song. However once they were immersed in a Spanish context again, recall would come with much more ease.&lt;ref name=Viorica&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Ulric, Neisser (2000.) Language-dependent recall of autobiographical memories. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 3'', 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that autobiographical memories have increased availability in the language they were created in. That is to say, memories are richer and more elaborate when recalled in the language that the event has taken place, rather than the other language available to them.&lt;ref name=Viorica /&gt; This can also be referred to as the [[Encoding specificity principle]], where memories appear to be encoded in a language-specific manner.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt; Earlier memory events that occur during youth and are encoded in the first and dominant language, are more emotionally charged, have a higher quality of detail and are greater in number than those memories recalled in the second language.&lt;ref&gt;Schrauf, R. W. (2000), Bilingual autobiographical memory: experimental studies and clinical cases. ''Culture Psychology, 6''(4), 387-417. doi: 10.1177/1354067X0064001&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be argued that the language that is spoken and recalled more frequently, will have more associations to multiple circumstances and is therefore more likely to be remembered.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;  Problems can arise if a language that comes to mind 'internally' is not the language that is being spoken externally. For example, if someone recalled an event in Spanish, but then reported it in English. This changeover in languages is most likely to do with the [[Content (memory)|content]] of the memory itself.&lt;ref name=Viorica /&gt; Evidence has been shown that language-specific recall of information when probed or cued in the matching language, is recalled vividly, and with much more elaboration and detail. It has also been shown that each language that a bilingual possesses, may represent experiences in somewhat different fashions.&lt;ref name=Golato /&gt;

==Bilingual working memory==

[[File:Baddeley working memory.jpg|thumb|alt=Baddeley's model|Alan Baddeley's Model of Working Memory]]
[[Working memory]] is an active part of the memory system that temporarily stores and processes information during mental operations.&lt;ref name=Clellen&gt;Gutiérrez-Clellen, V.,F., &amp; Calderón, J. (2004). Verbal working memory in bilingual children. ''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 47''(4), 863-76. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/232333683&lt;/ref&gt; Highly related are the concepts of [[attention]] and executive control.&lt;ref name=Namazi&gt;Namazi, M., &amp; Thordardottir, E. (2010). A working memory, not bilingual advantage, in controlled attention. ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, 13''(5), 597-616. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13670050.2010.488288&lt;/ref&gt; A major function of the working memory system is the retention and processing of verbal information.&lt;ref name=Namazi /&gt; [[Baddeley's model of working memory]] suggests the phonological loop, a slave system that is responsible for the rehearsal of verbal information and has been implicated in language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A., Gathercole, S., &amp; Papagno, C. (1998). The phonological loop as a language learning device. ''Psychological Review, 105''(1), 158-173. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/214220164&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures of verbal working memory are predictive of proficiency in a second language&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; and working memory capacity is strongly correlated with first and second language abilities.&lt;ref name=Namazi /&gt; Despite these correlations, research into the effects of bilingualism on working memory have been largely inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; Bilingual performance on working memory tasks can be affected by language dominance, language proficiency, and the nature of the task, variables which can be difficult to control and assess.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; However, most recent research suggests that there are no differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals in regards to working memory performance,&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel De Abreu, P. M. J. (2011). Working memory in multilingual children: Is there a bilingual effect? Memory (Hove.Print),19(5), 529-537. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/901183359&lt;/ref&gt; although more research is still required to make any conclusive claims. The evidence suggests that working memory performance has a stronger relationship with general linguistic proficiency than it does with the acquisition of a second language.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; It has also been observed that there are no significant cross-language differences within bilinguals, providing further support for the hypothesis that working memory is not language specific.&lt;ref name=Clellen /&gt; Bilingual speakers are, however, more accurate in assessing their [[metalinguistic]] reading and working memory abilities compared to monolingual speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ransdell, S., Barbier, M., &amp; Niit, T. (2006). Metacognitions about language skill and working memory among monolingual and bilingual college students: When does multilingualism matter? ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, 9''(6), 728-741. doi:10.2167/beb390.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digit span===

Research has found that there are cross-linguistic differences on a short-term memory test known as the [[digit-span]] task. For example, Chinese speakers as compared to English speakers had a greater digit span.&lt;ref name=Thorn&gt;Thorn, A. S. C., &amp; Gathercole, S. E. (2001). Language differences in verbal short-term memory do not exclusively originate in the process of subvocal rehearsal. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review: A Journal of the Psychonomic Society, Inc., 8(2), 357-364. doi:10.3758/BF03196173&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation of this observation is that digits in English take longer to say and subvocally rehearse in the [[phonological loop]], a component of Baddely's model of working memory. It has been suggested that because memory for short words is better than for long words, a phenomenon known as the ''word-length effect'', that there are cross-linguistic differences on the digit span task.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt; This difference has also been observed in Welsh-English bilinguals, who rated themselves as more proficient in Welsh but had a greater digit span in English because of the shorter digit names.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt; However, research has suggested that familiarity and long-term memory may play an important role and that differences are not strictly the result of subvocal rehearsal rates.&lt;ref name=Thorn /&gt;

===Inner speech===

Our thoughts often occur as the inner speech of our natural language. Inner speech is used for such things as rehearsing facts, having a mental conversation with oneself, and counting, among many others.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;Larsen, S. F., Schrauf, R. W., Fromholt, P., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2002). Inner speech and bilingual autobiographical memory: A polish-danish cross-cultural study. ''Memory, 10''(1), 45-54. doi:10.1080/09658210143000218&lt;/ref&gt; Being fluent in more than one language can affect inner speech in multiple ways. Studies have revealed that fluent bilinguals use their natural language to mentally represent exact numbers, however, non-numerical facts are retrieved in either language with equal ease.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, P. (2002). The cognitive functions of language. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 25''(6), 657-74; discussion 674-725. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212317857&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual individuals report feeling and acting different when in different linguistic mindsets and are capable of switching between them for the strategic purpose of activating different (context/language-dependent) information.&lt;ref&gt;Schrauf, R.

Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212295845&lt;/ref&gt; As perceived language proficiency in a second languages increases, the use of that second language for inner speech becomes more habitual.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt; As well, it has been reported that bilinguals who suffer from psychosis experience hallucinations or reduced linguistic competence in only one language.&lt;ref&gt;Henser, S. (2002). Relativistic implications of a natural-language-based format for thought. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences,2''5(6), 688-689. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/212296538&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual semantic memory==
[[Semantic memory]] is a term coined by [[Tulving]] and is closely related to episodic memory, it is a kind of mental dictionary containing all the attributes of event-free knowledge.&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; It relates to general facts about the world (e.g., the sky is blue, 2+2=4)&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; and it has no concern with time or space.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; Semantic memory does not require conscious thought, as it generally is automatic; it is not bound, except as interest links themes. It has been suggested that retrieval cues for semantic data are themselves semantic.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

Recent studies have shown that knowing a second language extends semantic memory and other cognitive capabilities&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt; as they recruit different cognitive operations.  It is shown to increase the normal capacity and expose the person to new situations and different ways of organizing thoughts. They learn to incorporate different concepts, and language specific inputs.&lt;ref name= Kormi-NouriR /&gt;  The finding of a positive bilinguality effect for semantic memory provides support for the role of organization in bilinguality.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;  [[Bilingualism]] and [[monolingualism]] semantic memory is often tested using word fluency tests, to gauge whether and how well these individuals organize their thoughts.  These tests have indicated that the type of material is not necessarily of importance but rather the mental activity is more important.  It is also found that the bilingualism effect can be observed more under automatic processing than under deliberate processing.&lt;ref name= Kormi-Nouri /&gt;

There are two predominant models of bilingual memory, the Hierarchical Model and the Concept features model. The Hierarchical Model assumes three linked components: a first language lexicon, a second language lexicon, and a conceptual store containing semantic referents.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt; Links between words in the first language lexicon and their meanings in the underlying conceptual store would be strong for bilinguals.  For newer bilinguals links running from the second language lexicon to the conceptual store would be relatively weak, if present at all, the links from the second language lexicon to the first language lexicon would be the strong ones. So the bilingual would translate the word from the second language into the first language and from there access the conceptual store (Cheval to horse to basic idea of a horse vs. cheval to basic idea of a horse). Fluent bilinguals have stronger and more direct links to the conceptual store form both languages.  In the Concept Features Model, when words have highly prototypical, concrete referents (desk, juice) the translations in both languages would activate the same set of underlying semantic nodes. In more conceptual and abstract referents (poverty, intelligence) translation equivalents activate different but overlapping sets of semantic nodes.&lt;ref name= Schrauf /&gt;

In bilingual memory as Colin M. MacLeod&lt;ref name=Macleod /&gt; found the two translated words (e.g., Horse and Cheval) are not stored as synonyms, they share the same supralinguistic semantic representation in memory (a supralinguistic concept is an abstraction of meaning more primitive than the word itself, it cannot be defined). It is stored in a kind of tag on a language free semantic representation of the world, where the input language is stored as a semantic trace.

In general a positive effect of bilingualism in semantic memory is more pronounced for older than for younger children.&lt;ref name= Kormi-NouriR /&gt;  Since bilingual children engage in extensive practice of two languages at an early age, they become better at paying attention to parts of information and at inhibiting other parts. Overall they have better recall and recognition in letter fluency especially when older and more educated, but the more similarity between their two languages lessens the advantage, as when they are very close there is more overlap of information.

===Bilingual mental lexicon===
{{see also|Bilingual Lexicon|l1=Bilingual lexicon}}
[[Mental lexicon]] refers to the permanent store of words in an individual's memory, and is thought to be organized in a semantic network.&lt;ref name =Wang&gt;Wang, H., &amp; Hou, Y. (2011). Research into the mental lexicon representation of Chinese English learners based on spreading activation model. ''Studies in Language and Literature, 2''(1), 68-80.&lt;/ref&gt; This network is related to the [[spreading activation]] model purposed by Collins and Loftus, as one word (node) is activated, words that are semantically and lexically related will also be activated.&lt;ref name= Swanson /&gt;&lt;ref name =Wang /&gt; [[File:Semantic Features Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|alt=mental lexicon|Mental Lexicon Model]] Evidence has been found to support the view that a bilingual individual has the same conceptual system for both of their languages.&lt;ref name =Dong&gt;Dong, Y., Gui, S., &amp; Macwhinney, B. (2005). Shared and separate meanings in the bilingual mental lexicon. ''Bilingualism, 8''(3), 221-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dong, Gui, and Macwhinney have demonstrated the convergence of a new language into a preexisting mental lexicon in their article "Shared and Separate Meanings in the Bilingual Mental Lexicon".&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt; When a person first learns a second language, the language has its own conceptual system and is heavily reliant on the first language to gain understanding and meaning of the new words.&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt; For example, a Spanish learner is learning the word "gato", and will refer back to their original language (ex. English) to translate it into "cat" to gain meaning, relation, and contextual information surrounding that word. However, the more advanced an individual becomes in acquiring a certain language, the two conceptual systems will eventual converge into one, where one language influences the other and vice versa.&lt;ref name =Dong /&gt;

===Tip of the tongue in bilinguals===

It has been found that Bilinguals are more susceptible to the [[tip of the tongue]], in cases where the [[phonology]] of a word is different in both languages. For example, when recalling a word such as "hair" in English, there is more [[Language transfer|interference]] from the French word "cheveux", because they sound and are spelled differently. However, when a word is phonologically similar in both languages, bilinguals produce less errors than individuals who are monolingual. For example, the word "chocolate" is similar to the translated word in French, which is "chocolat". Overall, bilinguals experience the tip of the tongue phenomenon more than individuals who are monolingual. This is confirmed by the evidence that bilinguals are less able to recall words, or initiate representations of words that are different in each language.&lt;ref&gt;Gollan, T. H., &amp; Acenas, L. R. (2004). What is a TOT? Cognate and translation effects on Tip-of-the-Tongue states in spanish–english and tagalog–english bilinguals. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition'', 30 (1), 246 –269. DOI: 10.1037/0278-7393.30.1.246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual-coding theory==

The [[dual-coding theory]] was first postulated by Paivio and Desrochers in 1980, and indicates that two systems are responsible for the encoding and retrieval of information from memory.&lt;ref name= Arnedt&gt;Arnedt C. S., &amp; Gentile, J. R. (1986). A test of dual coding theory for bilingual memory. ''Canadian Journal of Psychology, 40''(3), 290-299.&lt;/ref&gt; The verbal representational system encodes verbal information, such as words. While the imagery system encodes and retrieves non-verbal objects, such as images and scenes.&lt;ref name= PAC&gt;Paivio, A., Clark, J. M., &amp; Lambert, W. (1988) Bilingual dual-coding theory and semantic repetition effects on recall. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 14''(1), 163-172.&lt;/ref&gt; The dual-coding theory enunciates that these two systems can operate independently, as well as interdependently. Therefore, verbal cues can be activated independently of images, and vice versa. However verbal cues can also prime images through associative relationships, while images can prime verbal items through associative connections as well.&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;  This is not surprising, as a person can often describe an image using verbal behaviors, indicating the interconnectedness of the two systems. This theme continues into the bilingual adaptation of the dual-coding theory, which indicates that an individual's verbal representational systems for their two languages operate independently of one another, but also have associative connections with each other.&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid&gt;Vaid, J. (1988). Bilingual memory representations: A further test of dual coding theory. ''Canadian Journal of Psychology, 42''(1), 84-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, thinking of synonyms for "fierce" using English words, would only involve the English language system. But if a person is required to translate the word "fierce" into the French version, this would entail the two language systems to have associative connections. Indicating that the two language systems can act independently of each other, and that each language system has their own within language connections.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= PAC /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt;

Some flaws with the bilingual dual coding theory have been identified. One of which deals with the constant finding that translated items are better recollected than the words that are directly recalled or require deriving synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; This was originally thought because translated words are better remembered because they engage both memory systems, compared to synonyms which require the use of only one memory system. With this in mind, it was also thought that between language systems have stronger associations, compared to within language systems. This means that there are well developed associations for the translated words because there are stronger associations between two languages, compared to the connections within only one language, as seen with synonyms.&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; Other explanations have also been explored to explain this phenomenon, one is that the translated words are better remembered because they are more deeply processed than words that people are simply asked to recall or create synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt; This is in line with the [[levels of processing effect]], where in relation to the bilingual dual coding theory, words that participants are required to think of synonyms for are better recalled than the words they were simply asked to copy. This is because creating synonyms requires deeper processing than just duplicating a word. Similarly, words that participants are required to translate will be better remembered than the words they created synonyms for.&lt;ref name= Arnedt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Vaid /&gt;

==Language-dependent recall==
Language-dependent recall is a phenomenon that signifies memories are best recalled when the language at encoding matches the language during recall.&lt;ref name= Ulric&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Ulric, N. (2000). Language-dependent recall of autobiographical memories. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 129''(3), 361-368.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the [[encoding specificity principle]] purposed by Tulving and Thompson, which states that recall is better when the retrieval context is similar to the context in which the memory was encoded.&lt;ref name= Fausey&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Fausey, C.M. (2006). Language-dependent memory in bilingual memory. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20''(8), 1025-1047.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language-dependent recall is also significantly related to [[context-dependent memory]]. In the perspective of bilingualism, context dependent memory indicates that the language spoken during the encoding of the event acts as the external context. Whereas the language that a person thinks, rehearses and conducts inner speech constitutes the internal environment. Therefore, it is important to reinstate these internal and external contexts in which a person encodes the memory in order to enhance recall.&lt;ref name= Ulric /&gt;

Consequently, this has major impacts on bilingual individuals, who can interchangeably encode a memory in English, for instance, and encode another memory in French due to their diverse language capabilities. An example of context-dependent memory in the case of bilingualism is seen in an example by Viorica and Kaushanskaya. They asked participants this question: "name a statue of someone standing with a raised arm while looking into the distance". This inquiry was asked in two separate languages, English and Mandarin. When asked the question in Mandarin, the individuals were more likely to say the "Statue of Mao". However, when asked in English, the participants said the "Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Viorica, M., &amp; Kaushanskaya, M. (2007). Language content guides memory content. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 14''(5), 925-933.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when a person encodes a memory in English, but is asked about the memory in French, their inner verbalization of the memory, matches that during the encoding (i.e. they are remembering the event in the language that it was encoded with). Thus indicating the importance of reinstating the internal and external context during retrieval to match the context during encoding.

Accordingly, autobiographical memories and semantic knowledge can be impaired when the language during the recall (ex. English) of the memory does not match the language during encoding (ex. French).  However, there are several benefits when the contexts do match.  For example, Viorica and Fausey found that when the linguistics at encoding match the linguistics during retrieval it increases the speed, accuracy, and emotional intensity of the memory. Thus suggesting that language impacts the cues that are involved in the retrieval of bilingual memories.&lt;ref name= Fausey /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecolinguistics''', or '''ecological linguistics''', emerged in the 1990s as a new [[paradigm|frame of study]] of linguistic research, widening [[sociolinguistics]] to take into account not only the social context in which language is embedded, but also the [[ecology|ecological]] context.

[[Michael Halliday]]'s 1990 paper ''New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.|first=Halliday, M. A.|date=April 1990|title=New Ways of Meaning: A Challenge to Applied Linguistics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED324960}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often credited as a seminal work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of the [[ecosystem]]s that life depends on. The main example Halliday gave was that of 'economic growth', describing how 'countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink', which leads to ecologically destructive consequences. 

==Overview==
Since Halliday's initial comments, the field of ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a wide range of linguistic frameworks and tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The [http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ International Ecolinguistics Association], characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org|title=The International Ecolinguistics Association|website=ecolinguistics-association.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other ecological humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology.

The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in '[[Linguistic ecology]]', 'communication ecology' and 'learning ecology' in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is becoming less prevalent now as ecolingusitics becomes increasingly understood as a form of ecological humanities/social science.

Another aspect of ecolinguistics is the influence of the natural world on language. In 1996, [[David Abram]]'s book, ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' described how the wider ecology (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures (Abram, 1996), helping people attune to their environment. On the other hand, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that 'our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs' (1996:267).

Overall there are three main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The Ecological Analysis of Language', the second 'Language Diversity', and the third 'The Influence of Ecology on Language'.

==Ecological analysis of language==

The ecological analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an ecological perspective with reference to an ecological framework (or ecosophy), and judged to be beneficial in encouraging people to protect the ecosystems that life depends on, or destructive in encouraging behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for new stories to live by (Stibbe 2015). Stories which have been exposed and resisted by ecolinguistics include consumerist stories, stories of unlimited economic growth, advertising stories, stories of intensive farming, and stories which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using Positive Discourse Analysis, ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional and indigenous forms of language around the world.

This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about the environment and environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999). It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economic discourse or discursive constructions of consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature (e.g. Goatly 2000). The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' was introduced in Stibbe (2015), which describes eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Approaches such as [[environmental communication]] and [[ecocriticism]] have broadly similar aims and techniques to this form of ecolinguistics.

==Language diversity==

Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and linguistic imperialism are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important [[Traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]] contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995). This research is in line with the United Nations Environment Program's position that:

"Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and which has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species, and ecosystems. (UNEP 2007)"

Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that 'Delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost'. Mühlhaüsler (2003:60) describes how 'The rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity'.

Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the ecological wisdom embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

==Influence of ecology on language==

Abram's early chapter on "The Flesh of Language"  examined the contribution of the sensate body—and of the body's ongoing interaction with the earthly terrain—in the emergence of meaningful speech. A longer chapter on "Animism and the Alphabet" contrasted the discourse of indigenous, oral cultures with the discourse of literate cultures. For oral cultures, the coherence of spoken language is inseparable from the coherence of the surrounding ecology, from the expressive vitality of the more-than-human terrain. For these peoples "it is the animate earth that speaks; human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse." (p.&amp;nbsp;179) A subsequent chapter, entitled "In the Landscape of Language," drew examples from a range of divergent oral cultures to show some of the diverse ways that the local, more-than-human terrain informs and influences the discursive speech of oral cultures. Overall, Abram argues that ecology plays a key role in shaping human language in oral cultures, but with writing this role becomes less and less significant. This results in a situation where ‘our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs’ (1996:267). He therefore argues for using language in ways which bring ecology (or the 'more-than-human-world') back into language:

"there can be no question of simply abandoning literacy, of turning away from all writing. Our task, rather, is that of taking up the written word, with all of its potency, and patiently, carefully, writing language back into the land. Our craft is that of releasing the budded, earthy intelligence of our words, freeing them to respond to the speech of the things themselves - to the green uttering-forth of leaves from the spring branches." (Abram 1996:273)

__NOTOC__
'''Ethnolinguistics''' (sometimes called '''cultural linguistics''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferraro |first=Gary |title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-10008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies the relationship between language and culture and how different [[ethnic group]]s perceive the world. It is the combination between [[ethnology]] and linguistics. The former refers to the way of life of an entire community: all the characteristics that distinguish one community from the other. Such characteristics make the cultural aspects of a community or a society.

Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Cognitive Foundations of Grammar''. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1974) ''Topophilia: A study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, words for the [[cardinal direction]]s ''east'' and ''west'' are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] speakers of [[Greenland]], however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one's position on the coast. Similarly, the [[Yurok language|Yurok]] lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the [[Klamath River]].

Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"/&gt; Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"&gt;Sharifian, Farzad (2011). Cultural Conceptualisations and Language: Theoretical Framework and Applications. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Not a typo|Cultural Linguistics}}, language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of [[applied linguistic]] research, including [[intercultural communication]], [[second language learning]], Teaching English as an International Language, and [[World Englishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, Farzad &amp; Palmer, Gary B. (eds.) (2007) Applied cultural linguistics: Implications for second language learning and intercultural communication. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''farfallino alphabet''' (in [[italian language|Italian]] '''alfabeto farfallino''') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] used primarily in [[Italy]], which can be regarded as an elementary form of [[substitution cipher]]. It is usually used by [[child]]ren for amusement or to converse in (perceived) privacy from [[adult]]s. The name "farfallino" comes from the word "farfalla" (butterfly), which is an ordinary Italian word but sounds like the "codified" words in farfallino alphabet. The farfallino alphabet is similar to games found in other languages such as [[jeringonza]] ([[spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), [[langue de feu]] ([[french language|French]]), [[Fay Kee Bolee]] ([[Urdu]]) and [[pig latin]] ([[English language|English]]).

==Rules and variations==
The usual rules for farfallino alphabet are based on the substitution of each vowel with a 3 letter sequence where the vowel itself is repeated with an interceding ''f''.
 
* [[:wikt:casa#Italian|casa]] → ca'''fa'''sa'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:lago#Italian|lago]] → la'''fa'''go'''fo'''
* [[:wikt:stella#Italian|stella]] → ste'''fe'''lla'''fa'''
* [[:wikt:re#Italian|re]] → re'''fe'''
* [[:wikt:cercare#Italian|cercare]] → ce'''fe'''rca'''fa'''re'''fe'''

&lt;blockquote style="background: ccccff; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;"&gt; Here is an example:
:''Quefestofo èfe ufun efesefempifiofo difi frafasefe ifin afalfafabefetofo fafarfafallifinofo. Nofon èfe fafacifilefe, afanchefe peferchèfe vafa defettofo ifil pifiùfu vefelofocefe pofossifibifilefe''
Its translation in Italian is:
:Questo è un esempio di frase in alfabeto farfallino. Non è facile, anche perché va detto il più veloce possibile
Which means, in English:
:This is an example of phrase in Farfallino Alphabet. It is not easy, also because you should say it as fast as possible.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are several minor variations to this scheme. One such variation is based on the following substitution rules: 
* a → agasa
* e → eghese
* i → ighisi
* o → ogoso
* u → ugusu

Although rules for ''e'' and ''i'' look different, they are not; the additional ''h'' is needed in Italian to enforce a [[voiced velar plosive]] sound for letter ''g'', which is implicit in the other combinations. Another more complicated scheme, which is used in some regions of Italy, is as follows:
* a → aufer
* e → enghel
* i → ix
* o → older
* u → uflez

[[File:ConnectorSymbols.svg|thumb|Schematic symbols for male and female connector pins]]
In [[electrical]] and [[machine|mechanical]] trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating [[Electrical connector|connectors]] or [[fastener]]s is conventionally assigned the designation '''male''' or '''female'''. The "female" connector is generally a [[AC power plugs and sockets|receptacle]] that receives and holds the "male" connector. On occasion, the terms "male" and "female" are respectively referred to as the '''A''' and '''B''' ends{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name; unambiguous, though rare, terms include '''plug''' and '''socket''' or '''jack'''.

The assignment is a direct [[analogy]] with [[genitalia]] and [[heterosexual]] [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]; the part bearing one or more [[Protrusion|protrusions]], or which fits inside the other, being designated [[male]] in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated [[female]]. Extension of the analogy results in the verb '''to [[mating|mate]]''' being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together. 

In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power ''from'' one device ''to'' another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

In terms of mathematical [[graph theory]], an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a [[directed tree]], with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.

In other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is ''not'' enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. In plumbing situations where one-way flow ''is'' desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. gravity flow, one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.

==Mechanical fasteners==
[[Image:Bolt-with-nut.jpg|thumb|''Female'' nut threaded onto a ''male'' bolt]]
In mechanical design, the prototypical "male" component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a [[mounting boss]], or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.

While some mechanical designs are "one-off" custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire [[fastener]] industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.

==Modular construction toys==
[[Image:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|Lego toy brick connections are ''male'' on top, and ''female'' underneath]]
Although this aspect is not highlighted in their promotional literature, several common construction toys&lt;ref name=Toys&gt;[[:Category:Construction toys]]&lt;/ref&gt; embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. This should not be surprising, since these toys feature the nearly infinite flexibility and versatility of shape that a modular interconnect architecture can enable. Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known [[construction set]]s using [[group theory]] to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.

For example, the canonical [[LEGO]] plastic blocks have "female" indentations on the lower surface, and "male" bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. [[Meccano]] and [[Erector]] have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.

[[Stickle bricks]], using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless. [[Lincoln logs]] use a very simple form of genderless connections. [[Kapla]] or [[KEVA planks]] are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.

==Plumbing==
{{main article|Threaded pipe}}
[[Image:Malefemalepipe.jpg|thumb|right|Left: A ''male'' threaded pipe,&lt;br&gt;Right: a ''female'' threaded [[Piping and plumbing fittings|elbow]]]]

In plumbing fittings, the "M" or "F" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:
* MIPT denotes Male Iron Pipe Thread;
* FIPT denotes Female Iron Pipe Thread.

A short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Nipple|nipple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plumbingsupply.com/chrome.html Chrome Fittings &amp; Nipples]&lt;/ref&gt; A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Coupling|coupling]].

[[Hermaphroditic]] connections, which include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as [[Storz]] [[fire hose]] connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the 
[[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)]] connectors section of this article.

==Downspout==
[[Downspout]]s ('''downpipes''', '''rain conductors''' or '''leaders''') are used to convey rainwater from [[roof gutters]] to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes.  These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often [[crimp connection|crimped]] with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section.  These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.

==Ductwork==
[[Sheet metal]] [[ductwork]] for conveying air in [[HVAC]] systems typically uses gendered connections.  Typically,  the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female.  However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers,  "backwards" gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing [[Adhesive|mastic]] or tape to prevent leakage anyway.  The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.

==Electrical and electronic==

Although the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of [[electrical connectors]] because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female [[D-subminiature]] connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the "maleness" of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of ''male pins'', rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like [[XLR connector|XLR]]. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.

Further confusion can be caused by the term "[[jack (connector)|jack]]", which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and [[IEEE 200-1975]] (replaced by [[ASME Y14.44-2008]]) define "[[plug (connector)|Plug]]" and "[[jack (connector)|Jack]]" by location or mobility, rather than gender.&lt;ref name=IEEE3151975&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams (including Reference Designation Letters)|year=1975|publisher=IEEE|url=http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/315-1975.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE2001975&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE-200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASME-y14-44-2008&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 : Section 2.1.5.3 (2) | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/y1444-2008-reference-designations-electrical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A connector in a fixed location is a jack and a moveable connector is a plug.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt; The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug.  Jacks use the [[reference designator]] prefix of J and plugs use the [[reference designator]] prefix of P.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt;  It is possible in the case of box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts.  In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.

It is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is ''not'' always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer's AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male [[Coaxial power connector|coaxial power]] jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.

To summarize, it is considered best practice to use "male" and "female" for connector ''gender'', and "plug" and "jack" for connector ''function'' or ''mobility''.

===Variant usages===
In the UK, many [[Commonwealth countries]] and some non-English-speaking countries{{where|date=March 2012}}, the word "jack" may refer to the ''plug'' on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as "jack plugs", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or ''sockets'' (which North Americans would call "jacks"), but the second word was dropped.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.

In the United Kingdom, for example, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a "jack", that plugs into a ''socket'' on the main unit. The same generally occurs also in Italy, where the English word "jack" is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.

In Romania female connectors are known as "mamă" (mother) and male connectors are "tată" (father).

===Abbreviations and alternate terminology===
The standard letters "M" and "F" are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR [[microphone]] or [[hydrophone]] connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
* A3F = Audio 3-pin Female connector;
* A3M = Audio 3-pin Male connector.

The terms '''plug''', '''pin''', and '''prong''' are also often used for "male" connectors, and '''receptacle''', '''socket''', and '''slot''' are used for "female" connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than ''male'' and ''female'', especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.

For example, a female high-density [[D-subminiature]] connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Gender selection in electronic design===
Electronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.

With an RS232 [[serial port]], the male connector is more fragile than the female connector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the [[serial port]], in direct violation of the connector gender convention specified in the [[RS-232]] standard for "DTE" computer equipment. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention would cause many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.

In the case of electrical power connections, designers do not reverse connector gender in such a casual fashion, because exposing live AC line power on male connectors is unsafe and generally illegal. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage use a special male [[IEC 60320 C14]] connector (see Gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.

===Safety===
[[File:NEMA 5-15 Outlet 120V-15A.jpg|thumb|upright|Electrical power outlets are ''female'' for safety.]]

In electrical connections where [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] is sufficient to cause [[Electric shock|injury]], the part permanently connected to the power ''source'' is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device ''receiving'' the power.

In the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under [[electrical code]] to make or use any ''gender changers'' to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.

In [[Extra-low voltage|low-voltage]] use such as for [[telecommunication|data communications]], electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common [[Category 5 cable|"patch cables"]] used for [[Ethernet]] (and the similar cords used for [[telephone]]s) typically have male [[modular plug]]s on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.

[[File:Hohlstecker und Hohlbuchse 5,5x2,5.jpg|thumb|left|Common 5.5×2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[coaxial power connector]]s. Power is provided by the ''female'' ''plug'' on the right to the ''male'' ''jack'' on the left; the exposed conductors are not hazardous due to the low voltage. See text for further explanation. &lt;!--It's also usually isolated, but that's a lot of explanation...--&gt;]]

As an illustrative example of some design tradeoffs in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture. A commonly seen [[coaxial power connector]] is usually set up so that power is fed ''from'' the female plug on the right ''into'' the male jack on the left (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]].

In this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies [[Extra-low voltage|low voltage]] that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.
{{clear right}}

===Ambiguous gender===
Some electrical connectors are [[hermaphroditic]] because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of [[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)|Genderless connectors]] elsewhere in this article for more detailed information.

As an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a ''single'' connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector ''body'', rather than the mixed-gender connector ''pins'' and ''sockets''. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are ''not'' freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, '''mixed-gender'''. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).

Male connector pins are often protected by a '''shell''' (also called a '''shroud''', '''surround''', or '''shield'''), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. [[RF connector]]s often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] and [[triaxial cable]]. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the ''innermost'' connecting point.  With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know a Connector: RP-TNC|url=http://blog.showmecables.com/rp-tnc-connector/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for [[USB]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE-1394), [[HDMI]], and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact "pins" are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector ''as if'' it were a connector ''pin''. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are "female jacks".  A unique connector configuration where the contacts are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon where the contacts are bifurcated and nest with one another axial at a 90 degree rotation in cross-shaped wells.  In this case the plugs had the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets longitudinally. 

A casual glance at a USB "Type A" plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB "Type A" cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical [[graph theory]], USB buses are [[directed tree]]s, whereas FireWire buses have a true [[bus network]] topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.

==Genderless (hermaphroditic)==
[[Image:Train coupling.jpg|thumb|Paired "knuckle" type hermaphroditic mechanical [[Janney coupler|couplers]] for railcars (viewed from above)]]
[[Image:Arduino Protoboard Shields.jpg|thumb|[[Arduino]] "shield" boards connected via stackable bus connectors]]
By definition, a [[hermaphroditic]] connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include '''hermaphrodite''', [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|androgynous]], '''genderless''', '''sexless''', '''combination''' (or '''combo'''), '''two-in-one''', '''two-way''', and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with ''mixed gender'' connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.

Another closely related type is the '''stackable connector''' for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic [[milk crate]]s. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the [[IEEE-488]] instrumentation bus. '''Stackable mezzanine bus connectors''' are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the [[Arduino]] add-on daughterboards called "shields". The older [[PC/104]] embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.

The hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent "wrong gender" connector problems in field deployments.&lt;ref name=Timbercon&gt;{{cite web|last=Timbercon|title=Hermaphroditic Fiber Optic Connectors|url=http://www.timbercon.com/hermaphroditic-connectors/|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphenolFiber&gt;{{cite web |last=Amphenol Fiber Systems International |title=TFOCA-III Fiber Optic Connectors |url=http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185522/http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, [[railcar]]s are usually equipped with hermaphroditic [[railway coupling]] mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a [[train]] consist without having to turn the railcar around first.
For the same reason, several [[spacecraft docking mechanism]]s are designed to be "androgynous",
including the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]], the [[NASA Docking System]], and [[Chinese Docking Mechanism]].

In the absence of genderless connectors, ''[[gender changer]]'' fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.

When an enforced sense of unidirectionality or "one-way flow" is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.

Some commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the [[SAE connector]] for 12 V DC power, [[jackhammer]] air hose connectors, and the [[Anderson Powerpole]] series of modular high-current power connectors. The [[IBM]] [[token ring]] connector was another widespread example, but it has become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation ([[GenRad]]) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the "[[GR connector]]".

Some [[audio multicore cable]]s are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlwindusa.com/massdiff.html Whirlwind Technical Articles. ''Wiring MASS Connectors FAQ'']&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and which to the [[audio mixer]], facilitating faster set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2003/april/big/big.php Live Sound International. Archives, April 2003. ''Connect Corner: The ins and outs of multipin connector designs''. Peter Janis, Cabletek.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edac.net/product.html?ProductID=61 EDAC.

==Gender changers==
Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: "[[gender changer]]", "gender mender", "gender bender", "gender blender", "sex changer", and "homosexual adapter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gender-mender.html Jargon File: gender mender]&lt;/ref&gt; A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a "male gender changer" might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.

Adding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as [[Crossover_cable|cross-over]] pin-outs or even [[Active_cable|embedding micro-controllers]] for performance, or for [[Logic_level#Logic_voltage_levels|logic level]] or protocol adaptations, which would properly make them an [[Adapter_(computing)|adapter]], but this nomenclature is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common parlance.

==Examples==
* [[Coaxial power connector]], for low voltage DC connections
* A power cord on an [[Home appliance|appliance]] terminates in a (male) plug; it connects to a (female) socket in a wall or on an extension cord.
* [[Coaxial cable]]s used for video or other high-[[frequency]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] are normally terminated, at both ends, in a [[RF connector|connector]] comprising an inner pin and an outer fixed or rotating shell; these are conventionally reckoned as male.
* A threaded [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is female and a [[screw|bolt]] is male.
* Connectors for [[Air brake (road vehicle)|air brake]] [[Air hose|hoses]] on heavy [[Semi-trailer truck|trucks]] and [[Rolling stock|railroad equipment]] use genderless "[[gladhand connector]]s". In [[Railway air brake|railroad air brake]] use, this makes the orientation of rolling stock irrelevant, and is used with the standard North American [[Janney coupler|railroad coupler]] that connects cars together, also genderless.
* The [[Talmud]] describes arrow heads and mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, depending on their construction, i.e. a prong on a male arrow head fits into a hollowed out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a female shaft, from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as [[s'chach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Goldwurm| first = R.

The '''German Orthographic Conference of 1901''' (the '''Berlin II Orthographic Conference'''; {{lang-de|Zweite Orthographische Konferenz}} or ''{{lang|de|II. Orthographische Konferenz}}'') took place in Berlin from 17th till 19 June 1901. The results of the conference became official in the [[German Empire]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Peter von Polenz: ''Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart – Band III – 19. und 20. Jahrhundert''. Walter de Gruyter, 1999, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kopke: ''Rechtschreibreform und Verfassungsrecht''. J.C.B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck) Tübingen, 1995, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GdIiD"&gt;Edited by Werner Besch, Anne Betten, Oskar Reichmann, Stefan Sonderegger: ''Sprachgeschichte: Ein Handbuch zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und ihrer Erforschung – 2., vollständig neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage – 3. Teilband'' (''Hanbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft'', Band 2.3), Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 2495 (chapter "Geschichte der Interpunktionssysteme im Deutschen").&lt;/ref&gt; 
The standardized [[German spelling]] that resulted from the conference was largely based on the [[Prussian]] school spelling, but also on the [[Orthographic Conference of 1876]].

The conference results removed numerous existing variant forms.
Soon after the conference, its results were criticized by people{{who|date=June 2015}} who believed there should be further changes.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The spelling was used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], apart from the replacement of ''[[ß]]'' with ''ss'' in Switzerland in later years.
The ''Erziehungsrat des Kantons Zürich'' stopped the teaching of ''ß'' in schools in 1935 with the Kanton Zürich being the first to do so, and the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' as last Swiss newspaper stopped using ''ß'' in 1974. However, some Swiss book publishers still use ''ß''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon: ''Die deutsche Sprache in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Das Problem der nationalen Varietäten''. Walter de Gruyter, 1995, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Gerhard Helbig, Lutz Götze, Gert Henrici, Hans-Jürgen Krumm: ''Deutsch als Fremdsprache. Ein internationales Handbuch. 1. Halbband''. Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 496f.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 95 years later that the German spelling was changed with a [[German spelling reform of 1996|reform in 1996]].

==Overview ==

Indications are that the [[prevalence]] of upper back and neck pain has increased dramatically in the decade leading up to 2016.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hoy DG, Protani M, De R, Buchbinder R. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21665126"The epidemiology of neck pain.’'], ''Best Practice &amp; Research: Clinical rheumatology.'', 2010 Dec;24(6):783-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Amy Cuddy, ''Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges'', Little, Brown and Company, December 2015: 226-8. {{ISBN|9780316256575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase has been attributed to the corresponding widespread adoption of laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other small portable digital devices.

Because their screens do not separate from their keyboards these small devices cannot be set up [[ergonomically]] correctly (unless an extra screen or extra keyboard is added). They are unlike personal desk top computers (PCs) in this respect. Most commonly, the user hunches to operate them, often for many hours a day.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"&gt;[http://newsroom.simplyhealth.co.uk/iposture-generation-facing-a-lifetime-of-back-pain"iPosture generation facing a lifetime of back pain.’'], ''Simply Health.'', 2 October 2013, Retrieved 13 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunching increases the effective load on the neck up to several times more than does erect posture, due to increasing moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;KK Hansraj, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head."],''Surgery Technology International.'', Nov 25, 2014:277-9&lt;/ref&gt; Local pain, [[cervicogenic headache]] and [[referred pain]] extending down the arms can arise from the sustained muscle strain, cervical [[facet joint]] (or apophyseal, or zygapophyseal joint) compression and diminution of the [[Intervertebral disc|cervical]] foraminal nerve exits.

A hunched posture also sends out a body language message of submission and lower self-confidence, with some research indicating it can actually promote these in the person holding it. A comprehensive view of the research and concepts is found in Dr [[Amy Cuddy]]’s book ‘Presence’ (2015).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Treatment may include analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilsation, posture instruction and spinal fulcrums. Biomechanical analysis suggests a combination of approaches is best and gives more lasting results.

== Signs and Symptoms ==

In a neck with perfect posture (as seen for instance in young children) the head is balanced above the shoulders. In this position the load on each [[vertebra]] of the cervical spine is spread evenly between the two facet (apophyseal) joints at the back and the [[intervertebral disc]] and vertebral body at the front.

The iHunch is characterised by a posture with the head sitting somewhat forward of the shoulders (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the point of the shoulder (acromion process)). This can be very marked, with the back of the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward.

When the patient is asked to look up at the ceiling, the hunched-forward upper thoracic curve does not change as viewed from the side. Rather, the lower cervical spine ‘hinges’ backward at C5/6/7, a movement pattern known as ‘swan-necking'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eorthopod.com/news/swan-neck-deformity-of-the-cervical-spine/ "Swan Neck Deformity of the Cervical Spine"],''eOrthopod'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

This indicates that the upper back vertebrae have frozen in their habitual flexed positions, with the surrounding collagen of the ligaments, joint capsules and fascia shortening to reinforce this hypomobility. (This is the dowager’s hump of the elderly of earlier generations, now observable in modern (2016) late teenagers.&lt;ref name="medicinenet1"/&gt;)

Symptoms include overuse muscle pain and fatigue along the back of the neck and reaching down to the mid-back, often starting with the upper [[trapezius]] muscle bellies between the shoulders and neck. Cervicogenic headache from the joints and muscle attachments at the top of the neck is common.&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657/ "Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment."],''Lancet Neurol.'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201065/ "Cervicogenic Headaches: An Evidence-led Approach to Clinical Management"],''International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy.'', Volume 6(3); Sept 2011:254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The compressive load on the cervical facet joints predisposes to acute joint locking episodes, with pain and movement loss.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Vangindertael ed. [http://www.physio-pedia.com/Facet_Joint_Syndrome "Facet Joint Syndrome"],''Physiopedia'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients with already diminished cervical foramina spaces and/or [[osteophytes]], nerve root irritation and impingement can trigger referred pain down the arm(s).&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Jackson [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881998/"The Classic: The Cervical Syndrome"],'' Clinical Orthopeadics and Related Research'', v.468(7); 2010 Jul: 1739–1745&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

The human spine is well suited to erect upright posture, with the increased heart rate from movement shunting a good blood supply to the muscles. This is clearly not the
case for vast numbers of sedentary humans spending many hours daily bent over laptops, tablets, smartphones and similar. A biomechanical assessment of thoracic hunching shows the abnormal spinal loading and other effects which plausibly account for the recent steep rise in thoracic and cervical pain in step with the ubiquitous adoption of the small IT devices.

Hunching has always caused problems, for instance in occupational groups like dentists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/print/volume-98/issue-7/columns/preventing-pain-in-dentistry/trapezius-myalgia-making-dentistry-a-pain-in-the-neck-mdash-or-head.html/"Trapezius myalgia: making dentistry a pain in the neck — or head''], "Dental Economics, vol 98, issue 8; 2008&lt;/ref&gt; surgeons,&lt;ref&gt;Soueid A1, Oudit D, Thiagarajah S, Laitung G.

What has changed is the amount of hunching in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young.

== Epidemiology ==

The first [[laptop]] was produced in 1981 but it took more than a decade of development for the designs to approach current (2016) levels of portability and capacity, and hence uptake. Apple produced the first smartphone (the [[iPhone]]) in 2007 and the first tablet (the [[iPad]]) in 2010. In 2015 there were 4.43 billion [[mobile phone]] (cellphone) users in the world, of which 2.6 billion had smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Piejko [https://deviceatlas.com/blog/16-mobile-market-statistics-you-should-know-2016"16 mobile market statistics you should know in 2016"],''Device Atlas'', 12 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, 45% owned a [[tablet computer]] in 2014 and 92% owned a mobile phone; for younger adults aged 18–29, only 2% didn’t own a mobile phone and 50% had tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Anderson [http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/"Technology Device Ownership: 2015"],''Pew Research Centre: Internet, Science and Tech.'', 29 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A large Finnish cross-sectional study on school-age adolescents published in 2012 concluded that more than two hours a day spent on computers was associated with a moderate/severe increase in musculoskeletal pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paula T Hakala, Lea A Saarni, Raija-Leena Punamäki, Marjut A Wallenius, Clas-Håkan Nygård and Arja H Rimpelä [http://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2474-13-41"Musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents - pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study’'], ''BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders'', 22 March 2012: {{doi|10.1186/1471-2474-13-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the average UK 18-24 year-old spent 8.83 hours a day in front of a PC, laptop or tablet.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"/&gt; Neck pain per se has been a large problem for a long time, and surveyed repeatedly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A composite review of studies with good methodology by Fejer et al published in 2006 found that point [[prevalence]] (in pain right now) of neck pain in the adult (15–75 years) population ranged from 5.9% to 22.2%, with one study of the elderly (65+ years) finding 38.7% were in pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer R1, Kyvik KO, Hartvigsen J [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15999284"The prevalence of neck pain in the world population: a systematic critical review of the literature."],''European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society'', 2006 Jun;15(6)):834-48&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, more urban populations had more neck pain, e.g. 22.2% of a large 1998 Canadian study had neck pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Côté P, Cassidy JD, Carroll L. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9704377"The prevalence of neck pain and related disability in Saskatchewan adults"],''Spine'',1998 Aug 1;23(15):1689-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these surveys of neck pain prevalence, and adding to them the prevalence of thoracic pain and cervicogenic headache, it is reasonable to estimate that around one adult in six (15%) probably has pain in any, some or all of those areas right now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/ebpneckpain.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”],''Healing Arts Continuing Education'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However the published [[epidemiological]] papers draw on raw data from surveys done at least 10 years ago, and there are indications that the numbers have been rising dramatically since then – as rapidly as the adoption of laptops, tablets and smartphones. This is reflected in the recent rise in the number of popular articles, news items and media discussions about the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11531042"Smartphone addiction creating generation of teenage hunchbacks”],''New Zealand Herald'', Sunday Oct 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Navarro [http://www.techtimes.com/articles/115913/20151215/blame-your-iphone-for-ruining-your-posture-and-your-mood.htm"Blame Your iPhone For Ruining Your Posture And Your Mood”],''TECHTIMES'', 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen August [http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2576611/steve-august-the-ihunch"Steve August: the iHunch”],''Saturday Morning: Radio New Zealand'', 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==

The iHunch is a multi-factorial problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodystance.co.nz/ihunch.php “The iHunch analysed”], Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thoracic hunching requires flexing of the thoracic facet joints. After sufficient time and load, they can freeze and lock in this position. The [[collagen]] of the surrounding [[ligaments]], [[fascia]] and [[joint capsules]] will shorten down around the immobile joints, reinforcing the hunched hypomobile section of spine.
* The middle back support muscles ([[erector spinae]], [[rhomboid muscles|rhomboids]], middle and lower trapezius fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak.
* The cantilevered (poked forward) head position loads the spine up to several times more than erect posture, because of the increased moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;Hansraj KK. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head”],''Surgical Technology International'', 2014 Nov;25::277-9&lt;/ref&gt; So the posterior neck muscles (especially the upper fibres of trapezius) holding the head in its forward position, often sustained for many hours, can strain, producing individual [[myofibril]] and cell damage. Repair of this microtrauma involves the laying down of adhesive [[fibrosis]], as a normal part of the [[inflammatory response]]. Adhesive fibrosis is relatively non-elastic, so after sufficient repeated [[microtrauma]] from muscle strain, the posterior neck muscles become strained, shortened and less elastic.
* In this same cantilevered head position, the [[longus colli]] muscles and other deep neck flexors around the front of the neck are hardly being used, so they become weak, allowing the chin to poke out.
* The combined effect of all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At the top of the cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with pain referring over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the [[nuchal line]] of the [[occiput]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657"Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.”], ''The Lancet. Neurology'', 2009 Oct;8(10):959-68&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the [[intervertebral foramina]] are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, referring pain some distance down the arm(s).

== Treatment ==

[[Neck pain]] generally has been treated with a profusion of approaches and modalities, including [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; pain relief medications ([[analgesics]]) such as acetaminophen; low dose tricyclic [[antidepressants]] such as amytriptyline for chronic problems; [[Physical therapy]] (a.k.a. physiotherapy in British-derived cultures) which utilises a wide range of techniques and modalities; spinal manipulation from [[osteopaths]], [[chiropractors]], manipulating physiotherapists and doctors; massage; muscle strengthening programmes including gyms and [[Pilates]]; postural approaches such as the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and the [[Alexander Technique]]; stretching approaches such as [[yoga]]; ergonomic approaches including setting up desk top computers correctly and frequent breaks; [[acupuncture]]; and surgery for severe structural problems such as osteophytic impingement on the cervical nerve roots and [[cervical disc herniation]].

A biomechanical analysis of the iHunch indicates its standard, logical development from much flexed activity and its multi-factorial character. (See '''Pathogenesis''')

A composite approach which covers each component of the problem is therefore likely to be most successful and lasting. Most of the general treatment approaches to neck pain cover only one aspect. A logical response should include as a minimum:

* Strengthening, especially of (1) the middle and lower back support muscles and scapula retractors, and (2) the longus colli and the deep neck flexor muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stretching, especially of the upper fibres of the trapezius muscle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.htmll “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Massage, to loosen adhesive fibrotic tethering of the posterior neck and upper trapezius muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"/&gt;
* Unlocking of the hypomobile (frozen) facet joints of the thoracic spine and stretching of the shortened collagen reinforcing the excessive kyphosis (hunch). A sufficiently tight patch of thoracic spine cannot be freed up solely by patient exercises, stretches or movements. This is due to leverage – with any general exercise, the segments of the spine that are moving well will tend to move more, reducing the leverage on the hypomobile segments. A sufficiently localised external force is then necessary, such as specific hands-on spinal mobilisation or manipulation. A randomized clinical trial by Cleland et al showed manipulation of the thoracic spine reduced neck pain immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland JA, Childs JD, McRae M, Palmer JA, Stowell T. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922233"Immediate effects of thoracic manipulation in patients with neck pain: a randomized clinical trial.”], ''Manual Therapy'', 2005 May;10(2):127-35&lt;/ref&gt;
* However unless the surrounding shortened collagen also receives sufficient stretching, collagen rebound will tend to freeze up the facet joint again rapidly. Collagen is stronger by weight than steel wire and is best stretched by a sufficiently long, strong, localised, passive stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A Fisher [http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ce-Co/Collagen.html"Chemistry Explained Collagen”], ''Chemistry Encyclopedia'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms this may be achieved by the hunched patient lying back on a spinal fulcrum device, which uses the upper body weight to provide the external force, localised over the fulcrum.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

'''Language politics in Francoist Spain''' centered on attempts in [[Francoist Spain|Spain under Franco]] to increase the dominance of the [[Spanish language]] (Castilian) over the other [[languages of Spain]].
The regime of [[Francisco Franco]] had [[Spanish nationalism]] as one of its bases.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;
[[Sebastian Balfour]], "Spain from 1931 to the Present", in ''Spain: a History'', edited by
[[Raymond Carr]].  Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0198206194}}. (p. 266).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his dictatorship, the Spanish language (known in some parts of Spain as ''castellano'', i.e., ''Castilian'') was declared Spain's only [[official language]].
The public use of other languages was either banned,&lt;ref&gt;The use Catalan was banned for the on-duty functionaries of the province of Barcelona in 1940. Cf. {{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-X|pages=353|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; discouraged or frowned upon depending on the particular circumstances and timing, while the use of non Castilian names for newborns was forbidden in 1938, except for foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;"disposición do ''Boletín Oficial del Estado'' do 18 de maio pola que, advertindo que "La España de Franco no puede tolerar AGRESIONES CONTRA LA UNIDAD DE SU IDIOMA, ni la intromisión de nombres que pugnan con su nueva constitución política (...) tratándose de españoles, los nombres deberán consignarse en castellano""{{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-X|pages=353|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
The situation evolved from the harshest years of the immediate afterwar (especially the 1940s, also the 1950s) to the relative tolerance of the last years (late 1960s and early 1970s); Franco died in 1975, and his successor [[Juan Carlos of Spain]] began the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].

==Previous situation==
For the first time in the history of Spain, the [[Second Republic (Spain)|Second Republic]] recognised [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] as official languages when it granted autonomy for some regions with a regional language.

==The Spanish language==
[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|right|300px]] 
As part of the nationalistic efforts:
* [[Spanish film]]s were produced only in Spanish. All foreign films were required to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]], and all films originally produced in the languages of [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] were required to be re-issued in Spanish.
* [[Spanish names]] and Spanish versions of Catholic and classical names were the only ones allowed. Leftist names like ''[[Lenin|Lenín]]'' and regional names like even the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''[[George (given name)|Jordi]]'' (after Catalonia's patron saint, [[Saint George]]) were forbidden and even forcibly replaced in official records. Only Christian names in Spanish were allowed in official documents.

In the first decade of Franco's rule, languages other than Castilian were "confined to private spaces".&lt;ref name="sb" /&gt;

In the regime's most radical discourse, languages other than Spanish were often considered "[[dialect]]s" in the sense of speeches that were not developed enough to be "real [[language]]s". [[Basque language|Basque]] was different enough that it could not be taken as a debased form of Spanish but was despised as a rural language of limited currency, unfit for modern discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones, 
''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education'', (1998), Multilingual Matters (pp. 285-6).&lt;/ref&gt; This never happened at the academic level, though.

All these policies became less strict and more permissive as time passed.

==Evolution==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The Press Law of [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]] replaced the pre-publication censorship with after-the-fact punishments.

==Situation by areas==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}

Most notably, several sporting organizations -- including [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Athletic Bilbao]], among others -- were forced to change their names from the local language to Spanish. In fact, [[Atlético Madrid]], itself with roots in Athletic Bilbao, received its current name as a result of Franco's language policies, in 1941. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

{{Politics of Latvia}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' on the "Amendments to the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution of the Republic of Latvia]]"  was held on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/valodas-referendums-notiks-18februari.d?id=42026900|title=Valodas referendums notiks 18.februārī|publisher=Delfi.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed amendments included Articles 4, 18, 21, 101 and 104 of the Constitution of Latvia by adding the condition about [[Russian language|Russian]] as the second official language, as well as prescribing two working languages&amp;nbsp;— Latvian and Russian&amp;nbsp;— for self-government institutions.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine.

Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum's question was "Do you support the adoption of the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" that provides for the Russian language the status of the second official language?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html |title=Referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" |publisher=Web.cvk.lv |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2000 census, Russian was the [[native language]] of 37.5% and the [[second language]] of 43.7% of the residents. Since 2000, Russian has been regarded as a foreign language according to the Official Language Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=134&amp;id=164 |title=Valsts valodas likums |publisher=Vvk.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2010, the [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] started to collect signatures to force a referendum on whether all publicly financed schools would have to use [[Latvian language|Latvian]] exclusively. By 9 June 2011, they had gathered 120,433 signatures of the minimum 153,232 signatures required, failing to force a referendum.

Protesting against the National Alliance initiative, on 15 February 2011, the youth movement "[[United Latvia]]" ({{lang-ru|Единая Латвия}}), led by Eduard Svatkov, announced the idea of making [[Russian language|Russian]] an official language, alongside Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/153.html |title=Vienota Latvija: Krievu valodai ir jābūt oficiālai valsts valodai |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/16/44711142.html |title=Activitists want Russian to be Latvia"s 2nd state language: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2011, "United Latvia", together with the newly created organisation "Mother Tongue" ({{lang-ru|Родной Язык}}), led by activist [[Vladimir Linderman]] (former leader of the Latvian branch of the Russian [[National Bolshevik Party]]), [[Yevgeny Osipov (politician)|Yevgeny Osipov]] (leader of "Osipov Party"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/70511 |title="Партия Осипова" официально зарегистрирована|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksandr Gaponenko]] (director of the Institute of European Studies, economist), started to collect signatures for a [[initiative|referendum petition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/155.html |title="Vienota Latvija" sāk parakstu vākšanu par krievu valodas nostiprināšanu Satversmē |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/ru/home/155.html |title="Единая Латвия" начинает сбор подписей для закрепления русского языка в Сатверсме |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered 187,378 signatures, forcing a referendum.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/30608/ |title=The voice of the people |publisher=[[The Baltic Times]] |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/presseschau/archiv/article/ARTICLE100367-Don-t-panic-at-Russian-referendum-in-Latvia |title=Don't panic at Russian referendum in Latvia |publisher=eurotopics.net, [[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]] |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kp.ru/daily/25824.4/2800855/ |script-title=ru:Владимир Линдерман, инициатор референдума в Латвии: "Не врите, что русский язык был ввезен в Прибалтику на танках"|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum initiators mentioned possible [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of minority children as the main reason to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.subbota.com/2011/03/09/tn001.html |title=Может ли русский язык быть вторым государственным? |publisher=Old.subbota.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noravank.am/eng/articles/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=5081 |title=Peculiarities of bilingual education from the point of view of the national identity |publisher=Noravank.am |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of this protest action was to slow down the ongoing process of National Alliance signature collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.lv/story/17578.html |title=За русский язык |publisher=Gazeta.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those initiating the referendum to make Russian co-official argued: "In such case there is no other defense method than attack. The initiator of hysteria should be shaken strongly to stop hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.za-rodnoj-jazik.lv/arhiv/manifest/manifest.html |title=За родной язык |publisher=Za-rodnoj-jazik.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held after the [[Saeima]] rejected the draft law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" supported by more than one-tenth of the voters during the Collection of signatures. At least half of the entire electorate has to vote Yes in the referendum in order for it to be valid (771,893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/407778-referendums_notiks_18februari_visi_dodamies_balsot |title=Referendums notiks; 18.februārī visi dodamies balsot|publisher=Tvnet.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholars stated that beside statehood elements, the initiative would have influenced multiple basic human rights and general principles of law protected by the Constitution of Latvia, such as the right to preserve and develop the Latvian language and Latvian ethnic and cultural identity, to participate in the work of the state and of local government, and to hold a position in the civil service; the right to choose one’s employment and workplace freely; the right to education; the rights of a child; and the right to equality and non-discrimination, principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"/&gt;

The referendum organisers did not deny that the main achievement would be to show a large number of Russian language supporters and the final goal would be to change the status of Russian from foreign to some legal (i.e. regional) in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/197269 |title=Линдерман: получение русским официального статуса и в интересах латышей тоже|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official status for Russian was requested due to the fact that the Constitution and Official Language Law do not have any other definitions for language status other than making a language official. Amendments for granting any other status for Russian (i.e. regional) would have had a higher risk of rejection by the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia|Constitutional Court]], thus cancelling the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasha.lv/rus/novosti/news/Interwie/46990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three-quarters of voters voted against Russian as a second national language, with only the eastern region of [[Latgale]] seeing a majority of citizens voting for the change. The referendum had considerably higher voter participation than in previous elections and referendums, with more than 71.1% of registered voters casting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/report-results.html Provisional results of the referendum] Retrieved 2012-02-19. (in Latvian)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
A large part of the Russian speaking community in Latvia (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because, since 1991, they have held [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizen]] status and thus have no right to vote. However, the above numbers also show that non-citizens could not have changed the result of the referendum if they had been allowed to vote. If all 290,660 members of the Russian community had participated and voted in favor of the motion, the proposal would still have been rejected with 59.15% against and 40.60% in favor, with turnout increasing to 75.68% from 71.11%.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Analysis==
Analysts say the turnout, at nearly 70 percent, indicates the strength of feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2012/02/19/latvians-say-no-in-russian-language-vote Latvians say “no” in Russian language vote] www.euronews.net. Retrieved 2012-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum can widen the schism in society and the government will have to undertake serious efforts to consolidate the country's two groups. Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/latvia-russian-language_n_1286544.html?ref=world Latvia Russian Language Referendum Has High Turnout] The Huffington Post.

A '''lecture''' (from the French 'lecture', meaning 'reading' [process]) is an oral [[presentation]] intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a [[university]] or [[college]] [[teacher]]. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.

Though lectures are much criticised as a [[teaching method]], universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of [[communication]] that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon [[passive learning]].  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to [[active learning]]. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in [[academia]] as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.

Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "[[keynote|keynote addresses]]", i.e., lectures. The [[public lecture]] has a long history in the sciences and in [[social movement]]s. [[Hiring hall|Union halls]], for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, [[Local church|churches]], [[Community centre|community center]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[museum]]s, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of [[oral tradition]] in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of [[grey literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603045435/http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} GreyNet International, Document Types in Grey Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Golan levin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Golan Levin]] lecturing using a projected side]]
The noun "lecture" dates from 14th century, meaning "action of reading, that which is read," from the [[Latin]] ''lectus'', pp. of ''legere'' "to read." Its subsequent meaning as "oral discourse on a given subject before an audience for purposes of [[Education|instruction]]" is from the 16th century. The verb "to lecture" is attested from 1590.
The noun "lectern" refers to the reading desk used by lecturers.

==History==
The practice in the [[medieval university]] was for the instructor to read from an original source to a class of students who took notes on the lecture. The reading from original sources evolved into the reading of glosses on an original and then more generally to lecture notes. Throughout much of history, the diffusion of knowledge via handwritten lecture notes was an essential element of academic life.

[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rembrandt's ''The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp'']]
Even in the twentieth century, the lecture notes taken by students, or prepared by a scholar for a lecture, have sometimes achieved wide circulation (see, for example, the genesis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''Cours de linguistique générale'').  Many lecturers were, and still are, accustomed to simply reading their own notes from the lectern for exactly that purpose. Nevertheless, modern lectures generally incorporate additional activities, e.g. writing on a chalk-board, exercises, class questions and discussions, or student presentations.

The use of [[multimedia]] presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] has changed the form of lectures, e.g. video, graphics, websites, or prepared exercises may be included. Most commonly, however, only outlines composed of "bullet points" are presented.  Critics such as [[Edward Tufte]]  contend that this style of lecture bombards the audience with unnecessary and possibly distracting or confusing graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Tufte, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified lecture format, generally presented in 5 to 15 minute short segments, is now commonly presented as video, for example in [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) or in programs such as the [[Khan Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html Daphne Koller, ''What we're learning from online education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804030308/http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html |date=2012-08-04 }}, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hogarth lecture 1736.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[William Hogarth]]'s 1736 [[engraving]], 
''Scholars at a Lecture'']]
Bligh, in ''What's the Use of Lectures?'', argues that lectures "represent a conception of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to students who do not and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing."  Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information.  Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968).  He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes.  Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. 
The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.
Early editions of the book contained a reply paid evaluation card. This research showed that the section on alternative teaching methods within lectures was the most highly praised.&lt;ref name=Bligh&gt;{{cite book|last=Bligh|first=Donald|title=What's the use of lectures?|year=1998|edition=5th|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=9781871516791|pages=316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-xxxqZXUU8C}} [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf Ch.1 and Ch. 3 reprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011213244/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of the lecture as needing to be a didactic event has been challenged by Meltzer and Manivannan (2002) and Sandry (2005) who maintain that lectures can involve active learning.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|title=Using Technology to Prevent Plagiarism: Skilling the Students|first1=Christopher|last1=Ireland|first2=Gillian|last2=Byrne|date=29 April 2015|publisher=|via=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175516/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|archivedate=31 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elliot (2005) sees difficulties in the encouragement of active learning with phenomena such as [[social loafing]] and [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension]] causing audience members to be reluctant to participate.&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt; A possible solution to the encouragement of audience involvement in lectures is the use of an [[Audience response#Use in Educational Settings|audience response system]] which allows audience members to participate anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199 | volume=41 | title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education | journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education | pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
The effectiveness of traditional lecture is and has been debated. Some advantages of lecturing include: quick exposure to new material, greater teacher control in the classroom, an engaging format, which may complement and clarify course material, and facilitating large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Lecturing also permits the dissemination of unpublished or not readily available material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Lecturing|url=http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|website=TeachingResourcesGuide.com|publisher=South Alabama University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112936/http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
There has been much debate as to whether or not lecturing actually improves student learning in the classroom.  Commonly cited disadvantages of lecture include: placing students in a passive (rather than an active) role, encouraging one-way communication, requiring significant out-of-class time for students to engage with the material, and requiring the speaker to possess effective speaking skills.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311181116/http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally misattributed&lt;ref name=notes2notes/&gt; to [[Mark Twain]]:
{{quote|College is a place where a professor’s lecture notes go straight to the students’ lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either.&lt;ref name=notes2notes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Professor’s Lecture Notes Go Straight to the Students’ Lecture Notes|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=April 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502201823/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}. This source suggests that [[Edwin Slosson]] is more likely the original writer.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other forms==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
While lecturing is generally accepted as an effective form of instruction, there have been some prominent educators who have succeeded without the help of lectures.

Many [[university]] courses relying on lectures supplement them with smaller discussion sections, [[tutorial]]s, or laboratory experiment sessions as a means of further actively involving students. Often these supplemental sections are led by [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s, [[tutor]]s, [[teaching assistant]]s, or teaching [[fellow]]s rather than senior [[Faculty (division)|faculty]]. Those other forms of academic teaching include [[Conversation|discussion]] ([[recitation]] if conducted by a teaching assistant), [[seminar]]s, [[Training workshop|workshop]]s, [[observation]], practical application, [[case example]]s/[[case study]], [[experiential learning]]/[[active learning]], [[computer]]-based instruction, and [[tutorial]]s. 
  
In [[school]]s, the prevalent mode of student-teacher interaction is [[lesson]]s.

The term "[[Parlour|parlor]] lecture" gained currency throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] during the mid-19th century.  It referred to the custom of inviting noted speakers to deliver private lectures, which were typically hosted in the parlors of wealthy and socially influential families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm Gaskell's Compendium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172539/http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian mysticism}}
A '''''Lingua Ignota''''' (Latin for "unknown language") was  described by the 12th century [[abbess]] of Rupertsberg, [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard of Bingen, OSB]], who apparently used it for mystical purposes. To write it, she used an alphabet of 23 letters denominated ''litterae ignotae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingensis|first1=Hildegardis|title=Riesencodex|date=1175-1190|pages=934, 464v|url=http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fdokumentserver.hlb-wiesbaden.de%2FHS_2%2Fmets17.xml&amp;tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=934&amp;tx_dlf%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;cHash=16dea2091d5605fe4f100c3fd07fdab5|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

She partially described the language in a work titled ''Lingua Ignota per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata'', which survived in two manuscripts, both dating to ca. 1200, the [[Wiesbaden Codex]] and a Berlin MS (Lat. Quart. 4º 674), previously Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, collected by Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmayer E; Sievers, E. (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/diealthochdeutsc03steiuoft#page/390/mode/2up ''Sachlich geordnete Glossare''].  Die Althochdeutschen Glossen, Vol. III. pp. 390-404.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is a [[glossary]] of 1011 words in Lingua Ignota, with [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]es mostly in [[Latin]], sometimes in [[Middle High German|German]]; the words appear to be [[A priori (Languages)|a priori]] [[Neologism|coinages]], mostly nouns with a few adjectives. Grammatically it appears to be a partial [[relexification]] of Latin, that is, a language formed by substituting new vocabulary into an existing grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jean Jeskalian, ''Hildegard of Bingen: the creative dimensions of a Medieval personality."  Graduate Theological Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Lingua Ignota is unknown, and it is not known who, besides its creator, was familiar with it. In the 19th century some{{who?|date=July 2018}} believed that Hildegard intended her language to be an ideal, [[universal language]]. However, nowadays{{when?|reason= starting when?|date=July 2018}} it is generally{{whom?|reason=If you don't mean that in the implausible sense of "by everyone", then by whom?|date=July 2018}} assumed that Lingua Ignota was devised as a secret language; like Hildegard's "unheard music", she would have attributed it to [[divine inspiration]]. Inasmuch as {{vague|reason= is this supposed mean "To the degree that" or "Since (as all readers will agree)"?|date=July 2018}}  the language was constructed by Hildegard, it may be considered one of the earliest known [[constructed language]]s.

In a letter to Hildegard, her friend and provost Wolmarus, fearing that Hildegard would soon die, asks ''[[ubi sunt|ubi]] tunc vox inauditae melodiae? et vox inauditae linguae?'' (Descemet, p.&amp;nbsp;346; "where, then, the voice of the unheard melody? And the voice of the unheard language?"), suggesting that the existence of Hildegard's language was known, but there were no initiates who would have preserved its knowledge after her death.

==Sample text==
The only extant text in the language is the following short passage:
:''O '''orzchis''' Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es '''caldemia''' stigmatum '''loifolum''' et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam '''crizanta''' in alto sono, et es '''chorzta''' gemma.''
These two sentences are written mostly in Latin with five key words in Lingua Ignota; as only one of these is unambiguously found in the glossary (''loifol'' "people"), it is clear that the vocabulary was larger than 1011 words.  (Higley 2007 finds probable correspondences for two other words.)

:"O ''orzchis'' [[Ecclesia (Church)|Ecclesia]], girded with divine arms, and adorned with hyacinth, you are the ''caldemia'' of the wounds of the ''loifol'', and the city of sciences. O, o, and you are the ''crizanta'' in high sound, and you are the ''chorzta'' gem."
''loifol'' "people" apparently is inflected in Latin, yielding ''loifol-um''.

Newman (1987) conjectures the translation
:"O ''measureless'' Church, / girded with divine arms / and adorned with jacinth, / you are the ''fragrance'' of the wounds of ''nations'' / and the city of sciences. / O, o, and you are ''anointed'' / amid noble sound, / and you are a ''sparkling'' gem."

==The glossary==
The glossary is in a hierarchical order, first giving terms for God and angels, followed by terms for human beings and terms for family relationships, followed by terms for body-parts, illnesses, religious and worldly ranks, craftsmen, days, months, clothing, household implements, plants, and a few birds and insects. Terms for mammals are lacking (except for the [[bat]], Ualueria, listed among birds, and the [[Griffin|gryphon]], Argumzio, a half-mammal, also listed among the birds).

The first 30 entries are (after Roth 1880):
* Aigonz: ''deus'' (God)
* Aieganz: ''angelus'' (angel)
* Zuuenz: ''sanctus'' (saint)
* Liuionz: ''salvator'' (saviour)
* Diueliz: ''diabolus'' (devil)
* Ispariz: ''spiritus''
* Inimois: ''homo'' (human being)
* Jur: ''vir'' (man)
* Vanix: ''femina'' (woman)
* Peuearrez: ''patriarcha''
* Korzinthio: ''propheta''
* Falschin: ''[[vates]]''
* Sonziz: ''apostolus''
* Linschiol: ''martir''
* Zanziuer: ''confessor''
* Vrizoil: ''virgo'' (virgin)
* Jugiza: ''vidua'' (widow)
* Pangizo: ''penitens''
* Kulzphazur: ''attavus'' (great-great-great-grandfather)
* Phazur: ''avus'' (grandfather)
* Peueriz: ''pater'' (father)
* Maiz: ''maler'' (sic, for ''mater'', mother)
* Hilzpeueriz: ''nutricus'' (stepfather)
* Hilzmaiz: ''noverca'' (stepmother)
* Scirizin: ''filius (son)
* Hilzscifriz: ''privignus'' (stepson)
* Limzkil: ''infans'' (infant)
* Zains: ''puer'' (boy)
* Zunzial: ''iuvenis'' (youth)
* Bischiniz: ''adolescens'' (adolescent)

Nominal composition may be observed in ''peueriz'' "father" : ''hilz-peueriz'' "stepfather", ''maiz'' "mother" : ''hilz-maiz'' "stepmother", and ''scirizin'' "son" : ''hilz-scifriz'' "stepson", as well as ''phazur'' : ''kulz-phazur''. Suffixal derivation in ''peueriz'' "father", ''peuearrez'' "patriarch".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''maxim''' is a concise expression of a fundamental [[morality|moral]] rule or principle, whether considered as [[wikt:objectivity|objective]] or [[subjectivity|subjective]] contingent on one's [[philosophy]]. A maxim is often [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and motivates specific actions. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' defines it as:
{{quote|Generally any simple and memorable rule or guide for living; for example, 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] speaks of 'a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart ([[Locksley Hall]]), and maxims have generally been associated with a 'folksy' or 'copy-book' approach to [[moral]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Maxim (Oxford University Press 2008) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deontological ethics==

In [[deontological ethics]], mainly in [[Kantian ethics]], maxims are understood as [[subjectivity|subjective]] principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1)&amp;nbsp;the action, or type of action; (2)&amp;nbsp;the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3)&amp;nbsp;the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the [[categorical imperative]] provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.

The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|date=1993|pages=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.&lt;ref name="Gregor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|translator=Mary Gregor |title=Critique of Practical Reason|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=25/5:27|isbn=0-521-59051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, an action is said to have "moral worth" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his [[duty]] purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason.  Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely "from duty", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.

==Personal knowledge==
[[Michael Polanyi]] in his account of [[tacit knowledge]] stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Claxton, ''Live and learn (1992) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993).

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

The term '''morphome''' refers to a function in linguistics which is purely [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or has an irreducibly morphological component.  The term was introduced by [[Martin Maiden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|title=Morphological autonomy and diachrony|journal=Yearbook of Morphology|date=2004|issue=2004|pages=137–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Mark Aronoff]]'s identification of morphomic functions and the morphomic level—a level of linguistic structure intermediate between and independent of [[phonology]] and [[syntax]].  In distinguishing this additional level, Aronoff makes the empirical claim that all mappings from the morphosyntactic level to the level of phonological realisation pass through the intermediate morphomic level.

== Typology of morphomic patterns ==
Functions defined at the morphomic level are of many qualitatively different types.

One example is the different ways the [[perfect participle]] can be realised in English––sometimes, this form is created through [[suffix]]ation, as in ''bitten'' and ''packed'', sometimes through a process of [[ablaut]], as in ''sung'', and sometimes through a combination of these, such as ''broken'', which uses ablaut as well as the suffix ''-n''. Since these processes, which achieve the same result, are of different categories, it is not possible to call the formation of the perfect participle in English a suffix, so it must be assumed that it exists as an abstract category on the morphomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|title=Morphology by Itself|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is the division of [[lexemes]] into distinct inflectional classes. Inflectional classes present distinct morphological forms, but these distinctions bear no meaning beyond signalling inflectional patterns; they are internal to morphology, and thus morphomic.

Martin Maiden's theory of morphomes has been mostly developed with regard to the Romance languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029319590|title=The romance verb : morphomic structure and diachrony|last=1957-|first=Maiden, Martin,|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191056390|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=1029319590}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he identified many examples of morphomic stem distributions.

A different typology of morphomic patterns has been put forth by Erich Round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Round|first=Erich R.|title=Rhizomorphomes, meromorphomes, and metamorphomes|date=2015-03-01|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.001.0001/acprof-9780198723769-chapter-3|work=Understanding and Measuring Morphological Complexity|pages=28–52|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.003.0003|isbn=9780198723769|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes rhizomorphomes, which are a property of roots (corresponding to the traditional notion of inflectional class), metamorphomes, which are a property of paradigms, a set of cells which behave in a particular way (corresponding to the morphome in Maiden's terms, such as patterns of stem distribution), and meromorphomes, which are a property of exponents, and have only been identified for now in [[Kayardild language|Kayardild]] and related languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9613">'''Official multilingualism''' is the policy adopted by some [[State (polity)|states]] of recognizing multiple [[language]]s as [[Official language|official]] and producing all official documents, and handling all [[communication|correspondence]] and official dealings, including [[court]] procedure, in these languages. It is distinct from personal [[multilingual]]ism, the capacity of a person to speak several languages.

==States with policies of official bilingualism==

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Languages of Afghanistan}}
[[Afghanistan]] uses [[Dari language|Dari]] (or Afghan [[Persian language|Persian]]) and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as official languages. Many citizens are bilingual. These two languages account for 85% of Afghanis' native tongues.&lt;ref name="affactbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belarus===
{{see also|Languages of Belarus}}
In [[Belarus]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is far more common than [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and Section 17 of the [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]] designates both as official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/belarusian.shtml |title=Languages across Europe. |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
{{see also|Languages of Burundi}}
The official languages of [[Burundi]] are the local [[Kirundi language]] as well as the colonial French.

===Cameroon===
{{See also|Languages of Cameroon}}
[[Cameroon]] is extremely diverse linguistically and uses English and French as official languages.

===Canada===
{{Main|Bilingualism in Canada}}
{{See also|languages of Canada}}
In Canada [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]  have  special legal status over other languages in Canada’s courts, [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html|title=Official Languages Act - 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work=Act current to July 11th, 2010|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] is the only official bilingual province, while [[Quebec]] is the only province where French is the sole official language. The remaining provinces have English as the only official language. In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some bilingual services and some education in both official languages up to the high school level. English and French are official languages in all three territories (because they are federally administered). In addition, [[Inuktitut]] is also an official language in [[Nunavut]], and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]].

===Central African Republic===
{{see also|Languages of the Central African Republic}}
Out of 120 languages spoken in the [[Central African Republic]], French and the [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi-based]] creole [[Sango language|Sango]] are official.

===Chad===
{{see also|Languages of Chad}}
Citizens of [[Chad]] speak over 120 languages, and the standardized [[Chadian Arabic]] serves as the lingua franca with colonial language French also being official.

*[[Cook Islands]]

===Cyprus===
{{see also|Languages of Cyprus}}
Island nation of [[Cyprus]] has had [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as its languages since the 1960 [[Constitution of Cyprus|Constitution]] (Article 3, section 1). The usage of either language is complicated by the political dispute that lead to the creation of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

*[[Djibouti]]
*[[East Timor]]

===Finland===
{{see also|Languages of Finland}}
In Finland, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both considered "national languages". Municipalities of Finland are divided into three categories: unilingual Swedish, unilingual Finnish or bilingual. Finnish is the maternal language of about 90% of the population, and the bilingual or swedophone population is concentrated to the coastal areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and [[Southwest Finland]]. The autonomous province of [[Åland]] is officially unilingual (Swedish). Both Swedish and Finnish are compulsory school subjects.

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Bilingualism in Hong Kong}}
{{see also|Languages of Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong is officially bilingual. Both English and Cantonese are official languages.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Languages of the Philippines}}
The [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippine constitution]] designates [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as the national language and – along with English – as official languages. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the national and official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remained, along with English, as a de facto official language until removed in 1973 by a constitutional change. After a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, when the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] removed its official status.&lt;ref name="official languages"&gt;Article XIV, Section 3 of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1935-constitution.html 1935 Philippine Constitution] provided, "[...] Until otherwise provided by law, English and Spanish shall continue as official languages." The [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1943-constitution.html 1943 Philippine Constitution] (in effect during occupation by Japanese forces, and later repudiated) did not specify official languages. Article XV, Section 3(3) of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1973-constitution.html 1973 Philippine constitution] ratified on January 17, 1973 specified, "Until otherwise provided by law, English and Pilipino shall be the official languages.

Some people in native Tagalog areas are bilingual, while in non-Tagalog areas it is common to be multilingual in Filipino, English, and in one or more of the regional [[Languages of the Philippines|language]]s, or as in other cases in languages such as Spanish, [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ([[Hokkien]]), and Arabic due to factors such as ancestry and religion. Eleven regional languages are recognised by the government as auxiliary official languages in their respective regions, while 90+ other languages and dialects are spoken by various groups.

'''Optimot, linguistic inquiries''', is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute for Catalan Studies]] and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.

== History ==
Up to 2007, the Consortium for Linguistic Normalization, the TERMCAT Terminology Centre, the Institute of Catalan Studies, and the directorate-general of Linguistics Politics dealt with linguistic inqueries that came from general population, companies, organizations, and language professionals. In order to avoid decentralization of the linguistic enquiries and to offer a unified service, Optimot was implemented. The search engine started working in October 2007 and the personalized service began in February 2008. Mainly, Optimot was to improve quality in linguistic-inquiry service by unifying criteria, and to promote linguistic autonomy.

== Search sources ==
The sources used in the searches performed by Optimot are the following:&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.91021952ed2301e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ee8e44ce74aa3110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Optimot, consultes lingüístiques]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pariṇāma-vāda''' ({{lang-sa|परिणामवाद}}), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the [[Samkhya]]s, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] School of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) [[Vivartavada]] (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: Upadesasahasari of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpvPUsnUO8Sq7QaCnYDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the fourth, [[Pratityasamutpada|Pratityasamutpada-vada]], the theory of dependent origination of [[Buddhism]].

According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of [[Vedanta]], also accepted by the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta]], causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or [[Prakrti]]. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of [[Brahman]].
Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the [[Monotheism|Monotheistic Schools]]’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from [[Vivartavada]], the [[Monism|Monistic Schools]]’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.

==Arambha-vada==

The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]], which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sadhu Santideva|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arambhavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman as the cause==

The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of [[Pradhana]] or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.

==Sat-Karya-vada==

According to this philosophy, which follows from [[Satkaryavada|Sat-Karya-vada]], the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its [[Shakti]] (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srikanth’s Philosophy of the Monotheistic Vedanta|author=Ruma Chaudhury|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvwyXwxelxIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prakrti]] is orderly. The [[Ṛta]] (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in [[Indian Philosophy]] to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=414, 294, 364|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra view==

[[Tantra]] has influenced the [[Hindu]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of [[Abhasavada]] or [[Pratibimbavada]], explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakti – The Power in Tantra|author=Rajmani Tigunait|publisher=Himalayan Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XnnFl6ZFHwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWHPUoC7IMyThQe6woGgCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivartavada==

[[Gaudapada]] treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. [[Badarayana]] also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by [[Adi Sankara]], to whom owing to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of Gaudapadiya|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidyaranya]] reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form ([[Panchadasi]] 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=59,124|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd.|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKXPUqz3DJSqhQedzYHYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Both, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. [[Ramanuja]] accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Garma C.C.Chanpage=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6bPUtvnJ46ihgfY1oCYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">A '''passive speaker''' (also referred to as a '''receptive bilingual''' or '''passive bilingual''') is a [[speaker types|category of speaker]] who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leap|first=W|date=1998|title=Indian language renewal|url=|journal=Human Organization|volume=47|pages=283–291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such passively fluent individuals are often raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, Charlotte; Fathman, Ann (19 December 2008). "The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism''. '''11''' (5): 577–597. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F13670050802149192 10.1080/13670050802149192].&lt;/ref&gt;

Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]] who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

==Passive language==
A ''passive language'' is a related term used in interpreting or translating. It is the language or languages '''from''' which the interpreter works. For example if an interpreter's job is to translate from German, Dutch and Swedish into French, then French is the active language while the others are passive.

== Language attitudes ==
A more common term for the phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual' in which people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judged as not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare. One's fluency of a bilingual in a languages is domain-specific: it depends on what each language is used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|page=21|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language although there are social (extralinguistic) factors that underlie their different competencies.

== Basque Country ==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co-official status of [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to become a working reality. As there are now many monolingual Spanish-speakers, and no monolingual Basque-speakers in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], there is little reason for those fluent in Basque to speak it, regardless of the domain, circumstance or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|date=2009|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philology''' is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is the intersection between [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], [[history]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2joVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Philology |last=Peile |first=John |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1880 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.

In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philology |title=philology |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/philology |title=philology |website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philology]] studies [[classical languages]]. Classical philology principally originated from the [[Library of Pergamum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=F. W.|title=A Companion to Classical Texts|year=1968|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=22–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]]. It was preserved and promoted during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and eventually resumed by European scholars of the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]], where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) ([[Germanic philology|Germanic]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic]]), Eurasian ([[Slavistics]], etc.) and Asian ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit]], [[Sinology|Chinese]], etc.) languages. [[Indo-European studies]] involves the [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] philology of all [[Indo-European languages]].

Philology, with its focus on historical development ([[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] analysis), is contrasted with [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistics]] due to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[Synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]]. The contrast continued with the emergence of [[structuralism]] and [[Chomskyan]] linguistics alongside its emphasis on [[syntax]].
{{wiktionary}}

== Etymology ==
The term "[[:wikt:philology|philology]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλολογία}} (''philología''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111282 |chapter=φιλολογία |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the terms {{lang|grc|φίλος}} (''phílos'') "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[lógos]]'') "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of {{lang|grc|[[logos|λόγος]]}}. The term changed little with the Latin ''philologia'', and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from the [[Middle French]] ''philologie'', in the sense of "love of literature".

The adjective {{lang|grc|φιλόλογος}} (''philólogos'') meant "fond of discussion or argument, talkative", in [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]], also implying an excessive ("[[sophism|sophistic]]") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom, {{lang|grc|[[philosophy|φιλόσοφος]]}} (''philósophos'').

As an [[allegory]] of literary erudition, ''philologia'' appears in fifth-century postclassical literature ([[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature ([[Chaucer]], [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]]).

The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" ([[historical linguistics]]) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understanding [[sound law]]s and [[language change]], the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "from [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] to [[Nietzsche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/nwegmann/ |title=Nikolaus Wegmann, Princeton University Department of German |publisher=Scholar.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "Them Philologists: Philological Practices and Their Discontents from Nietzsche to Cerquiglini." ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 26 (2011): 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |title=Philology: General Works |journal=The Year's Work of English Studies |volume=4 |number=1 |year=1923 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1093/ywes/IV.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict", in ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] usage, and in British academia, "philology" remains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while in [[US English]], and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Morpurgo Davies|A. Morpurgo Davies]], ''History of Linguistics'' (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Bravmann, ''Studies in Semitic Philology''. (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the harsh critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly [[scientism|scientistic]] study of language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]].

== Branches ==

=== Comparative ===
{{main article|Comparative philology}}
[[File:Indo European philology historical and comparative 1969.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Indo-European Philology: Historical and Comparative'' by [[William Burley Lockwood]] (1969)]]

The [[comparative linguistics]] branch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities between [[Sanskrit]] and [[European languages]] were first noted in the early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;This is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he dates the first ''Gita'' translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and [[decipher]]ing the origins of older texts.

=== Textual ===
{{main article|Textual criticism}}
Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements of [[textual criticism]], trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among Ancient scholars in the 4th century BC Greek-speaking world, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission.  Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible.  Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the [[Bible]] from the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "[[critical apparatus]]", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.&lt;ref name = GB1&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JewJCYZlYV8C&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction |first=D. C. |last=Greetham |publisher=Garland Publishing |year=1994 |accessdate=2011-07-16 |isbn=9780815317913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study method known as [[higher criticism]] studies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.

Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known as [[New Philology]] has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.

=== Cognitive ===
{{main article|Cognitive philology}}
Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.

=== Decipherment ===
In the case of [[Bronze Age literature]], philology includes the prior [[decipherment]] of the language under study. This has notably been the case with the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Ugaritic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. In the case of [[Old Persian]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions ([[Middle Persian]] and [[Ancient Greek|Alphabetic Greek]]).

Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and others deciphered the [[Behistun Inscription]], which records the same text in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], using a variation of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] for each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was deciphered in 1915 by [[Bedřich Hrozný]].

[[Linear B]], a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known as [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]]. [[Linear A]], the writing system that records the still-unknown language of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], resists deciphering, despite many attempts.

Work continues on scripts such as the [[Maya script|Maya]], with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by [[Yuri Knorozov]] and others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as a [[logosyllabic]] style of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.

==In popular culture==

In the ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist - as was Lewis' close friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science-fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', is a philologist.

[[Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld]], the main character in [[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s 1997 comic novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' is a philologist, educated at Cambridge.

The main character in the [[List of submissions to the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language film]] in 2012, ''[[Footnote (film)|Footnote]]'', is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] philologist, and a significant part of the film deals with his work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">A '''philosophical language''' is any [[constructed language]] that is constructed from [[first principles]], like a [[Engineered language|logical language]], but may entail a strong claim of absolute perfection or transcendent or even mystical truth rather than satisfaction of pragmatic goals. Philosophical languages were popular in [[Early Modern]] times, partly motivated by the goal of recovering the lost [[Adamic language|Adamic]] or [[Divine language]].  The term '''ideal language''' is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as [[Toki Pona]] are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. It may be known as a language of pure ideology. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages today. 

In most older philosophical languages, and some newer ones, words are constructed from a limited set of [[morphemes]] that are treated as "elemental" or fundamental. "Philosophical language" is sometimes used synonymously with "taxonomic language", though more recently there have been several [[conlang]]s constructed on philosophical principles which are not taxonomic.  Vocabularies of [[oligosynthetic language]]s are made of [[compound word]]s, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of [[morpheme]]s; oligoisolating languages, such as Toki Pona, similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words. 

[[Toki Pona]] is based on [[minimalism|minimalistic]] [[voluntary simplicity|simplicity]], incorporating elements of [[Taoism]]. [[Láadan]] is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on [[muted group theory]].  

A priori languages are constructed languages where the vocabulary is invented directly, rather than being derived from other existing languages (as with [[Esperanto]] or [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).  Philosophical languages are almost all [[a priori (languages)|a priori languages]], but most ''a priori'' languages are not philosophical languages.  For example, [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] are all ''a priori'' but not philosophical languages: they are meant to seem like natural languages, even though they have no genetic relation to any natural languages.

==History==
Work on philosophical languages was pioneered by [[Francis Lodwick]] (''A Common Writing'', 1647; ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'', 1652), Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] (''[[Logopandecteision]]'', 1652), [[George Dalgarno]] (''Ars signorum'', 1661), and [[John Wilkins]] (''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'', 1668).  Those were systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. In 1855, English writer [[George Edmonds (lawyer)|George Edmonds]] modified Wilkins' system, leaving its taxonomy intact, but changing the grammar, orthography and pronunciation of the language in an effort to make it easier to speak and to read.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, George. ''A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language''.  [[Richard Griffin and Company]], London and Glasgow, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] created ''[[lingua generalis]]'' (or ''lingua universalis'') in 1678, aiming to create a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically; as a side effect he developed [[binary calculus]].&lt;ref name="lingua"&gt;[http://history-computer.com/Dreamers/Leibniz.html history-computer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

These projects aimed not only to reduce or model grammar, but also to arrange all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies.  This idea ultimately led to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally as a tree, and so impossible to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts.  Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century.  

After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the fringe.  Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (for example, [[Ro (language)|Ro]]).  More recent philosophical languages have usually moved away from taxonomic schemata, such as 21st century [[Ithkuil]] by [[John Quijada]].

The  examiner can [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness when an inconsistent statement is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior consistent statement.

==Impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement==
Before the witness can be impeached the examiner must have extrinsic evidence of the prior statement. The examiner must also provide the witness with the opportunity to adopt or reject the previous statement. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/files/crf13.htm Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 613]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, prior inconsistent statements may not be introduced to prove the truth of the prior statement itself, as this constitutes [[Hearsay in the United States|hearsay]], but only to impeach the credibility of the witness. 

However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and the minority of U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, a prior inconsistent statement may be introduced as evidence of the truth of the statement itself if the prior statement was given in live testimony and under oath as part of a formal hearing, proceeding, trial, or deposition.&lt;ref&gt;In some U.S. jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement that is signed or adopted by a witness is admissible both for impeachment and substantive purposes. ''See'', ''e.g.'', [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady|''Commonwealth v. Brady'']], 507 A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986). 

This approach has been rejected in the federal system.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Note''' that under [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §§769, 770, and 1235, prior inconsistent statements may be used for both impeachment and as substantive evidence, even if they were not originally made under oath at a formal proceeding, as long as "the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the statement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=47361519371+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve California Evidence Code §770]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolstering with a prior consistent statement==
===Prior consistent statements===

A prior consistent statement is not a hearsay exception, the FRE specifically define it as non hearsay. A prior consistent statement is  admissible:
# to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated a statement, for instance, during her testimony at trial; 
# the witness testifies at the present trial; and 
# the witness is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801 Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801 (d)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement that the prior consistent statement have been made under oath at a prior trial or hearing.

A form of prior consistent statement excepted from this rule is that of prior identification by the witness of another person in a lineup.

The '''Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730''' (''4 Geo II. c. 26'')&lt;ref&gt;"4th year of the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], chapter 26."&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which made [[English language|English]] (instead of [[Law French]] and [[Latin]]) the obligatory language for use in the courts of England and in the [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|court of exchequer]] in Scotland. The Act followed a medieval law from 1362 (the [[Pleading in English Act 1362]]&lt;ref&gt;36 Edw. III c. 15&lt;/ref&gt;), which had made it permissible to debate cases in English, but all written records had continued to be in Latin. It was amended shortly later to extend it to the courts in Wales,&lt;ref&gt;6 Geo II. c. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and to exempt from its provisions the "court of the receipt of his Majesty's exchequer" in England.&lt;ref&gt;6 Geo. II. c. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It never applied to cases heard overseas in the [[court of admiralty]].

A similar act was pasted on 22 November 1650 by the [[Rump Parliament]] during the [[Commonwealth of England]]: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56426 Act for turning the Books of the Law and all Process and Proceedings in Courts of Justice into the English Tongue].

The Act was introduced by the then [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], and came into force on 25 March 1733. It was repealed by the [[Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879]].&lt;ref&gt;42 &amp; 43 Vict c 59&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in 1737, the [[Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register complex''' is a combination of phonation type, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], length, [[vowel]] quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.

For instance, in a system where [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], voice quality and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like "Pai" (as in the [[English language|English]] word "Pie") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, "Pai" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~gt18/Papers/Vietnamese_tonogenesis.pdf |title=Vietnamese and tonogenesis: revising the model and the analysis |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many register languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in [[Bantu languages]] and throughout [[Africa]]. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the [[Kru languages]], though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and possibly [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8558">In [[modal logic]] and the [[philosophy of language]], a term is said to be a '''rigid designator''' or '''absolute substantial term''' when it designates (picks out, denotes, refers to) the same thing in ''all [[possible worlds]]'' in which that thing exists&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', Revised Second Edition 2008, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; and does not designate anything else in those possible worlds in which that thing does ''not'' exist. A designator is ''persistently rigid'' if it designates the same thing in every possible world in which that thing exists and designates nothing in all other possible worlds. A designator is ''obstinately rigid'' if it designates the same thing in every possible world, period, whether or not that thing exists in that world. Rigid designators are contrasted with [[Non-rigid designator|''connotative terms'', ''non-rigid'' or ''flaccid designators'']], which may designate different things in different possible worlds.

==History==
The [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers in the [[Middle Ages]] developed a theory of [[properties of terms]] in which different classifications of [[concepts]] feature prominently.

Concepts, and the terms that signify them, can be divided into '''absolute''' or '''connotative''', according to the mode in which they signify. If they signify something absolutely, that is, after the manner of substance, they are '''absolute''', for example rock, lion, man, whiteness, wisdom, tallness. If they signify something connotatively, that is, with reference to a subject of inherence, i.e., after the manner of accidents, they are '''connotative''', for example, white, wise, tall.

Both connotative and absolute concepts can be used to signify accidents, but since connotative concepts signify with a reference to a subject of inherence, they can refer to object with different definitions and properties (i.e. with different ''essences''). For example, large, as a connotative concept, can signify objects with many distinct essences: a man, a lion, a triangle can be large.

On the other hand, absolute concepts signify objects that have the same definitions and properties. For example, the concept of gold, as an absolute concept, can signify only objects with the same definitions and properties (i.e. with the same ''essence'').

==Proper names and definite descriptions==
The notion of absolute concepts was then revived by [[Saul Kripke]], with the name “rigid designation”, in the lectures that became ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', in the course of his argument against [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivist]] theories of reference, building on the work of [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]]. At the time of Kripke's lectures, the dominant theory of reference in [[analytic philosophy]] (associated with the theories of [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]) was that the meaning of sentences involving proper names could be given by substituting a contextually appropriate description for the name. Russell,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1917), ''Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, famously held that someone who had never met [[Otto von Bismarck]] might know of him as ''the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of the German Empire]]'', and if so, his statement that (say) "Bismarck was a ruthless politician" should be understood to mean "The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a ruthless politician" (which could in turn be analysed into a series of more basic statements according to the method Russell introduced in his theory of [[definite descriptions]]). Kripke argued—against both the Russellian analysis and several attempted refinements of it—that such descriptions could not possibly ''mean the same thing'' as the name "Bismarck," on the grounds that proper names such as "Bismarck" always designate ''rigidly'', whereas descriptions such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire" do not. Thus, for example, it ''might have been the case'' that Bismarck died in infancy. If so, he would not have ever satisfied the description "the first Chancellor of the German Empire," and (indeed) someone else probably would have. It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire&amp;mdash;that is (at least according to its surface-structure) a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names ''work'' is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of ''that particular person'' in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, ''the first Chancellor of the German Empire'' we ''could'' be talking about what might or might not have been true of ''whoever'' would have happened to fill that office in those situations.

The "could" here is important to note: rigid designation is a property of the ''way terms are used'', not a property of ''the terms themselves'', and some philosophers, following [[Keith Donnellan]], have argued that a phrase such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire" ''could'' be used rigidly, in sentences such as "the first Chancellor of the German Empire could have decided never to go into politics." Kripke himself doubted that there was any need to recognize rigid uses of definite descriptions, and argued that [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s notion of [[scope (logic)|scope]] offered all that was needed to account for such sentences. But in either case, Kripke argued, nothing important in his account depends on the question. Whether definite descriptions can be used rigidly or not, they can at least ''sometimes'' be used non-rigidly, but a proper name ''can only be used rigidly''; the asymmetry, Kripke argues, demonstrates that no definite description could ''give the meaning'' of a proper name&amp;mdash;although it might be used to explain ''who'' a name refers to (that is, to "fix the referent" of the name).

==Essentialism==
In ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke argues that [[proper name]]s and certain [[natural kind]] terms&amp;mdash;including biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxa]] and types of natural substances (most famously, "water" and "H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O") designate rigidly. He argues for a form of [[scientific essentialism]] not unlike Aristotelian essentialism. Essential properties are common to an object in all possible worlds, and so they pick out the same objects in all possible worlds - they rigidly designate.

==Causal-historical theory of reference==
Proper names rigidly designate for reasons that differ from natural kinds terms. The reason '[[Johnny Depp]]' refers to one particular person in all possible worlds is because some person initially gave the name to him by saying something like "Let's call our baby 'Johnny Depp'". This is called the initial baptism. This usage of 'Johnny Depp' for referring to some particular baby got passed on from person-to-person in a giant [[Causal theory of reference|causal and historical chain of events]]. That is why everybody calls Johnny Depp 'Johnny Depp'. Johnny's mother passed it onto her friends who passed it onto their friends who passed it onto their friends, and so on.

==Necessary identities==
{{see|Necessity of identity}}
One puzzling consequence of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If [[water]] is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then water is ''necessarily'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but ''conditionally'', ''if'' water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

''Sakshi'' is beyond time, space and the triad of experiencer, experiencing and experienced; ''sakshi'' witnesses all thoughts, words and deeds without interfering with them or being affected by them, other than ''sakshi'' there is nothing else in the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02ANh3NTm6sC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the word, साक्षी (''sākṣī''), used in the following verse from [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],

:एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः सर्वव्यापी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा |
:कर्माध्यक्षः सर्वभूताधिवासः साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च ||

:"The same Deity remains hidden in all beings, and is all-pervasive and the indwelling Self of all beings. He is the supervisor of actions, lives in all beings, (He is) the Witness, the bestower of intelligence, the Absolute and devoid of the (three) gunas." ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Sl. VI.11)
[[Pāṇini|Panini]] states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Śvetāśvatatra Upanisad 1986 Ed.|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=190–191|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/svetasvatara-upanishad-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakshi means [[Ishvara]], the चेता (cetā), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriya Yoga|author=Paramahamsa Hariharananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G11HR9B4io8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedanta]] speaks of mind (''chitta'') or ''antahkarana'' ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (''Chittakasha'') involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (''drg'') and the observed (''drshya''), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka|Drg-drshya-Viveka]]'' tells us:-

:"When form is the object of observation or drshyam, then the eye is the observer or drk; when the eye is the object of observation, then the mind is the observer; when the pulsations of the mind are the objects of observation, then Sakshi or the Witnessing-Self is the real observer; and it is always the observer, and, being self-luminous, can never be the object of observation. When the notion and the attachment that one is the physical body is dissolved, and the Supreme Self is realized, wherever one goes, there one experiences [[Samadhi]]. "

''Sakshi'', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the unchangeable eternal Reality, is the Pure Consciousness and knowledge, in which regard [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=86–87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJGFP__WXX0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oyExU7uCHs-GrAemvoCQBg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the senses (''indriyas'') are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Pschology: Its Meaning for the West|author=Swami Akhilananda|publisher=Routledge|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSVvzCC4mVYC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viIxU4rkNYLOrQfwzIAI&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the ''Bhumika'' ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of ''pranava'' (''Aum'' or ''[[Om]]'') as formed of or divided into – ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and ''ardhmātra'', which is on account of the difference of ''sthula'' ('gross'), ''sukshama'' ('subtle'), ''bija'' ('seed' or 'causal') and ''sakshi'' ('witness') whose ''avasthas'' ('states') are – 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. ''Sakshi'' which is '[[turiya]]' is the essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty which perceives the individual personality is ''Sakshi'' or 'Witness' or the higher 'Ego'. Mind (''manas''), Ego (''ahankara'') and ''Sakshi'', all perform different functions but that difference of functions does not mean difference in nature or essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rambles in Vedanta|author=B.R.Rajam Iyer|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=280, 289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89doofWiWJIC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iAxU9W8FIiFrAfQz4HQDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Philosophy discovered the concept of ''Sakshi'', the ultimate Observer, or Witness behind the sense of individuality, or the ego; the ''Sakshi'' is the timeless Being which witnesses all this ceaseless flow and change in the world of thought and things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manoniyantran|author=T.N.Achuta Rao|publisher=Gyan Books|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okUjWme6MF8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=sakshi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BB0xU-DbOI6FrgeLuYD4Dw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Secondary reference''' points to the [[understanding|representation]] as a necessary part in granting a [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] to a (part of a) [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In this approach, [[word]]s that don’t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s 'round [[quadrilateral|quadrangle]]'. [[Alexius Meinong]]'s Types of [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] can be mentioned here, too.

In the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.

Another example is presented by [[George Berkeley]]. He says: "[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither [[Oblique projection|oblique]] nor [[rectangle]], neither [[equilateral]], equicrural, nor scalenon, but ''all and none'' of these at once?" (''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing [[John Locke]], demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).

Whether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can’t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn’t; the sentence then doesn’t have a meaning for B.

'''''Shabda''''', or '''{{IAST|Śabda}}''', is the [[Sanskrit]] word for "speech sound". In [[Sanskrit grammar]], the term refers to an [[utterance]] in the sense of [[linguistic performance]].

==History==
In classical Indian [[philosophy of language]], the grammarian [[Katyayana]] stated that ''shabda'' ("speech") is eternal (''nitya''), as is ''[[artha]]'' "meaning", and that they share a mutual co-relation. According to [[Patanjali]], the permanent aspect of ''shabda'' is [[sphoṭa|{{IAST|sphoṭa}}]] ("meaning"), while ''dhvani'' ("sound, acoustics") is ephemeral to ''shabda''.

Om, or [[Om|Aum]], a sacred syllable of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]], is considered to be the first resonating vibrational sound within an individual being. It also denotes the non-dualistic universe as a whole. In Buddhism, Om corresponds to the [[crown chakra]] and white light.

[[Bhartrihari]], on the other hand, held a ''shabda-[[advaita]]'' position, identifying ''shabda'' as indivisible, and unifying the notions of cognition and linguistic performance, which is ultimately identical to [[Brahman]]. Bhartrhari recognised two entities, both of which may be referred to as ''shabda''. One entity is the underlying cause of the articulated sounds, while the other entity is the functionality that is used to express meaning. Bhartrhari thus rejected the difference posited between the ontological and the linguistic by [[Indian logic|logicians]]. His concept of ''shabda-brahman'' which identified linguistic performance and creation itself ran parallel to the Greek concept of ''[[logos]]''.

Language philosophy in Medieval India was dominated by the dispute of the "naturalists" to the [[Mimamsa]] school, notably defended by [[Kumarila]], who held that ''shabda'' designates the actual phonetic utterance, and the Sphota school, defended by [[Mandana Mishra]], which identifies ''[[sphota]]'' and ''shabda'' as a mystical "indivisible word-whole".

==In religion==

===Hinduism===
''Shabda'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that was first used as a religio-philosophic term in the context of Hindu religion. It refers to the verbal testimony (of revealed scriptures: ''[[shruti]]'' that is indispensable to gaining knowledge of the ultimate reality, Brahman.

===Sikhism===
In [[Sikhism]] the term ''Shabad'' has two primary meanings. The first context of the term is to refer to a hymn or paragraph or sections of the [[Holy Text]] that appears in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the main holy scripture of the Sikhs. The Guru Granth Sahib is organised by chapters of ''[[ragas]]'', with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in Guru Granth Sahib is the [[Mool Mantar]]. The script used for the ''Shabad'' is [[Gurmukhi]]. ''Shabad'' is the term also used to refer to hymns within other Sikh scriptures, like [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]]. The second use of the term ''Shabad'' in Sikhism is for the holy name of God, [[Waheguru]].

===Other faiths and philosophies===
Esoterically, ''Shabd'' is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.”&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/gloss.htm Glossary of Oriental terms and important names of persons and places] ''&lt;/ref&gt; Variously referred to as the ''Audible Life Stream'', ''Inner Sound'', ''Sound Current'' or ''Word'' in English,{{source?|date=January 2018}} the ''Shabd'' is the [[Esotericism|esoteric]] essence of [[God]] which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of [[Sant Mat]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Eckankar]], Vardankar (a split-off from Eckankar),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giamboi|first1=Heather|title=Thousands of Visits to Heaven and the Heart of God: "The Most Profound, Vividly Detailed Out of Body Discoveries Yet!"|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchell|first1=Paul|title=The Shariyat-Ki-Huray Book Two|publisher=Direct Path Publishing|isbn=978-0996907378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]].

Adherents believe that a ''[[satguru]]'', [[Eck Master]], or VARDAN Master, who is a [[human]] being, has merged with the ''Shabd'' in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the ''Satguru'' attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in [[Sant Mat]] the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d’être]]'' for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized.

''Naam'' ("Word") has been described through the use of several different terms. [[Sant Baljit Singh]], a contemporary Sant Mat Master, uses the term "Light and Sound Current". He describes it as the connecting link between human beings and God.

'''Speech-Language Pathology''' is a field of expertise practiced by a [[clinician]] known as a '''speech-language pathologist''' ('''SLP'''), also sometimes referred to as a '''speech and language therapist'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''speech therapist'''. SLP is considered a "related health profession" along with [[audiology]], optometry, [[occupational therapy]], [[Psychologist|clinical psychology]], [[physical therapy]], and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" SLPs are legally permitted to conclude to certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of [[communication disorders]] ([[Speech disorder|speech disorders]] and [[Language disorder|language disorders]]), cognitive-communication disorders, [[voice disorders]], and [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency are only two facets of the work of an SLP, however. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|first=|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include:
* [[phonation]] (producing sound)
* [[resonance]]
* [[fluency]]
* [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]]
* [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] variance;
* [[Human voice|Voice]] (including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]])
The components of [[language]] include:
* [[Phonology]] (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* [[Syntax]] (constructing sentences according to the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of a target language);
* [[Semantics]] (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* [[Pragmatics]] (social aspects of communication).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E.

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional [[dysphagia]] and [[feeding disorder]]s. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/|title=Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The profession==
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech ([[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates [[voice therapy]] to be especially helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Factor|first1=Stewart|last2=Weiner|first2=William|title=Parkinson's disease: Diagnosis &amp; clinical management : Second edition|date=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=9781933864006|pages=77–83|edition=2nd, rev. and updat;2; ed.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-discipline collaboration===

SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to [[audiologist]]s, [[physician]]s, neonatal specialists &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Mathisen, B. A., Carey, L.

For example, the treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]], often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.&lt;ref name="revistaOMF"&gt;

===Working environments===

SLPs work in a variety of clinical and [http://www.txsource.com educational settings]. SLPs work in public and private [[hospital]]s, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, [[hospice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pollens R |title=Role of the speech-language pathologist in palliative hospice care |journal=J Palliat Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=694–702 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15588361 |doi= 10.1089/jpm.2004.7.694|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA's) 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

===Education and training===
====United States====
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level [[professional degree]] field. [[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

===Salary information===
Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years. The median salary for pathologists jumped from $66,920 in 2010 to $74,680 in 2016, according to the BLS. The best-paid speech-language pathologists earned more than $116,810 in 2016, while the lowest-paid earned less than $47,070.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the basic salary that a Graduate SLP would earn is estimated at $59,500 Australian dollars rising to $120,000 for Private SLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/AU/Job=Speech_Pathologist/Salary|title=Speech Pathologist Salary (Australia)|website=www.payscale.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of assessment==
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  {{details|Speech and language assessment}}

==Clients and patients==
Speech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.

In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]]. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://asha.org/telepractice/&lt;/ref&gt; Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://vocalsaints.co.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/helping-your-childs-speech.aspx#close&lt;/ref&gt; If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.

A '''transcription service''' is a business service basically based on Speech to Text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speech To Text(Audio Transcription) |url=https://www.govivace.com/products/speech-to-text-transcription/ |publisher=GoVivace Inc. |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; process which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often provided for business, legal, or [[medical transcription|medical purposes]]. The most common type of transcription is from a [[spoken language|spoken-language]] source into [[Written language|text]] such as a [[computer file]] suitable for printing as a [[document]] such as a report. Common examples are the proceedings of a [[court hearing]] such as a [[criminal trial]] (by a [[court reporter]]) or a [[physician]]'s recorded voice notes ([[medical transcription]]). Some transcription businesses can send staff to events, speeches, or seminars, who then convert the spoken content into text. Some companies also accept recorded speech, either on cassette, CD, VHS, or as sound files. For a transcription service, various individuals and organisations have different rates and methods of pricing.	That can be per line, per word, per minute, or per hour, which differs from individual to individual and industry to industry. Transcription companies primarily serve private law firms, local, state and federal government agencies and courts, trade associations, meeting planners and nonprofits.

Before 1970, transcription was a difficult job, as secretaries had to write down the speech as they heard it using advanced skills, like [[shorthand]].	They also had to be at the location where the service was required. But with the introduction of [[tape cassette]]s and portable recorders in the late 1970s, the work became much easier and new possibilities emerged. Cassettes can travel through [[internal mail]] or [[mail|external mail]] which meant for the first time, the transcribers could have the work brought to them in their own office which could be in a different location or business. For the first time, transcribers could work from home for many different businesses at their own convenience, provided they met the deadlines required by their clients.

With the birth of modern technology like [[speech recognition]], transcription has become much easier. An [[MP3]]-based [[Dictaphone]], for example, can be used to record the sound. Recordings for transcription can be in different media file types&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transcriptionwing.com/audio-formats/|title=Audio Formats {{!}} TranscriptionWing|date=2015-09-01|work=TranscriptionWing: General Transcription Services, Audio Transcriptions|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The recording can then be uploaded to a [[Personal computer|PC]], uploaded to a [[cloud storage]], or emailed within minutes to someone who could be anywhere in the world.	The transcriptionist can then replay the audio many times. The sound can also be [[filtered]], [[equalization (audio)|equalised]] or have the [[tempo]] adjusted when the clarity is poor. The completed document can then be emailed back and printed out or incorporated into other documents – all within just a few hours of the original recording being made.

The industry standard for transcribing an audio file takes one hour for every 15 minutes of audio. For live usage, [[real-time text]] transcription services are available for captioning purposes, including [[Remote CART]], [[Captioned Telephone]], and live [[closed captioning]] for live broadcasts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Real-Time Captioning |url=https://www.govivace.com/solutions/captionai/ |publisher=GoVivace Inc. |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Live transcripts are less accurate than offline transcripts, as there is no time for corrections and refinements.	However, in a multistage subtitling process with a broadcast delay and access to a live audio feed it is possible to have several correction stages and for the text to be displayed at the same time as the "live" transmission.

== Interview transcription ==

Interview transcription is a word-to-word written documentation of a taped or live interview. All types of interviews pertaining to legal cases, businesses, research, celebrity interviews and many more can be transcribed. While tapes need to be played and replayed to get the exact information one is looking for, transcribed copies allow easy lookup for the desired information.	A written transcript is also important to identify key topics discussed in an interview. People with hearing imparity or deafness can also have access to the interview proceedings with accurately prepared interview transcripts. When transcribing interviews one needs to be aware and plan around conditions that ensure quality recording and transcribing.

== Medical transcription ==

By the early 1900s, the main responsibility of a doctor lay in treating the patient and other responsibilities such as creating a patient's medical record, keeping the files up to date and any other related paperwork eventually fell into the hands of hired medical stenographers. With the invention of typewriters, maintaining records became easier and with the invention of cassette players, it made way for the development of transcription machines. The initial versions available for purchase, offered the ability to record speech on cassette tapes. In fact, they were very popular for a long time although they did not offer much voice clarity at all. As soon as the usage of computers picked up in organizations and in other sectors, cassette tapes were replaced with better storage devices such as floppy discs and CD's. Today, the availability of highly sophisticated recording equipment ensures that multiple high clarity files can be created, stored and sent for medical transcription purposes.

Medical transcription presents other challenges as a service to the transcriber. For example, working knowledge of medical terminology like ICD codes and an understanding of the rules and regulations regarding HIPPA compliance may be necessary to complete a medical transcription service.

== Transcription security ==
Business meetings, and professional recordings can contain sensitive data, so security is an important factor which should not be overlooked by a transcription company when providing services to its clients. Companies should therefore follow the various laws and industry [[best practice]], especially so when serving [[law firm]]s, [[government agencies]] or [[court]]s.	Medical Transcription specifically is governed by [[HIPAA]], which elaborates data security practices and compliance measures to be strictly followed, failure of which leads to legal action and penalties.

Transcription security includes maintaining confidentiality of the data through [[information security]] practices including limiting access with [[password]]s and ensuring a [[secure environment]] for data and appropriate methods of disposal of all materials and deletion of files.	Personnel may be required to sign [[non-disclosure agreements]] on a regular basis as well as take various [[oath]]s regarding [[confidentiality]] and [[accuracy]].

An '''umbrella term''' is a word or phrase that covers a wide range of concepts belonging to a common [[Categorization|category]]. For example, ''[[cryptology]]'' is an umbrella term that encompasses [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]], among other fields. Similarly, an [[umbrella organization]] is a central and coordinating body representing a number of smaller, separate bodies.

A '''blanket term''' is a closely related [[morpheme|word]] or [[phrase]] that is used to describe multiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary or have a minimal relationship, but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease of use. In other words, a blanket term, by itself, gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but it is easy to say and remember. Blanket terms may originate as [[slang]] but eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary.

==Examples of umbrella terms==
* In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]:
** [[Grave goods]] – The personal possessions of a deceased person.
** [[Venus figurines]] – They extend over diverse time periods.
** [[Votive deposit]] – They are "essentially" in every human culture/"tribe".

[[File:Utterance.png|thumb|Utterance being spoken]]
[[File:Two-people-talking-logo.jpg|thumb|A black and white icon of two people talking to indicate discussion with one another]]

In [[spoken language]] analysis, an '''utterance''' is the smallest unit of [[speech communication|speech]]. It is a continuous piece of speech beginning and ending with a clear pause. In the case of [[oral language]]s, it is generally but not always bounded by silence. Utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do. They can be represented and delineated in [[written language]] in many ways.

In oral/spoken language utterances have several features including paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as [[facial expression]], [[gesture]], and posture. Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as [[ellipsis]], which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps. Moreover, other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non-fluency features including: voiced/un-voiced pauses (like "umm"), tag questions, and false starts when someone begins their utterances again to correct themselves. Other features include: fillers ("and stuff"); accent/dialect; deictic expressions, which are utterances like "over there!" which need further explanation to be understood; simple conjunctions ("and," "but," etc.); and colloquial lexis which are everyday informal words.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allinfo.org.uk/levelup/enb1.htm|title=Level Up: English Language|website=www.allinfo.org.uk|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterances that are portrayed in writing are planned, in contrast to utterances in improvised spoken language. In written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language. Discourse structure (which can also be found in spoken language) is how the conversation is organized, in which [[adjacency pairs]] - an utterance and the answer to that utterance - are used. [[Discourse marker]]s are used to organize conversation ("first," "secondly," etc.). [[Lexis (linguistics)|Lexis]] denotes the words being used in a text or spoken; these words can create a [[semantic field]]. For example, a semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore, admire, and care. Grammar/syntax is another feature of language in general but also utterances, and [[pragmatics]] means that when utterances are spoken or written the meaning is not literal, as in sarcasm.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Characteristics/features ==
An utterance which is found in spoken and [[written language]] as in a [[Screenplay|script]] has several characteristics. These include paralinguistic features which is a feature of communication that doesn't involve words but is added around an utterance to give meaning. Examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions, laughter, eye contact, and gestures. [[Prosodic]] features refer to the sound of someone's voice as they speak: pitch, [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and stress. Ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language, when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation. For example: A: Juice? B: Please. A: Room temperature? B: Cold.

Non-fluency features also occur when producing utterances. As people think about what to say to while speaking, there are errors and corrections in speech. For example, voiced/un-voiced pauses which are "umm," "erm," etc. in voiced pauses and in transcripts un-voiced pauses are denoted as (.) or (1) relating to the amount of time of the pause. [[Tag question]]s are also a part of non-fluency features; these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying. An example is "Do you know what I mean?" False alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again, usually to correct themselves.

[[Filler (linguistics)|Fillers]] usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance; these include lexis such as, "like," "and stuff,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Candea|first=Maria|year=2005|title=Inter- and intra-language acoustic analysis of autonomous fillers|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00321914/document|journal=Hal|volume=|pages=47–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accent/dialect is also a characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced, the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world. [[Deictic expression]]s are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood, like: "Wow! Look over there!" Simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like "and," "but," etc. Colloquial lexis is a type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== Child-directed speech ==
{{main|Child-directed speech}}
[[File:Mother Kissing Baby.jpg|thumb|A mother kissing her baby daughter]]
The development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents, adults, or any other guardian the child has growing up. Studies have indicated that this development of utterances is affected by the parent, adult, or guardian's [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). It has been shown that children have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood from parents with a high education and higher SES status, while children with less educated parents and lower SES status have a smaller vocabulary and a slower growth in their [[vocabulary]] skills (Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan &amp; Pethick, 1998; Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, Laursen &amp; Tardif, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991; Lawrence &amp; Shipley, 1996; Ninio, 1980){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexis when speaking to their children as opposed to parents that are less educated (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003 a; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea &amp; Hedges, in press){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Hoff conducted an analysis that shows support for this correlation in 2003 which shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their SES status and thus child vocabulary development. High-SES mothers use longer utterances when talking to their children and a wider variety of words. They also spend more time talking to their children. Low-SES mothers use shorter utterances and a smaller vocabulary. As a result, children with more educated parents have larger vocabularies (Hoff, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Meredith|title=Child-directed speech: relation to socioeconomic status, knowledge of child development and child vocabulary skill|url=https://www.education.umd.edu/HDQM/labs/Rowe/LDPL/Publications_files/Rowe_JCL_2008.pdf|journal=Cambridge University Press|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In child-directed speech, utterances have several additional features. For example, the [[phonology]] in child-directed speech is different: Utterances are spoken more slowly, with longer pauses in between utterances, higher pitches, etc. The lexis and semantics differ, and a speaker uses words suited for children, "doggie" instead of "dog," for example. The grammar is simpler, repetitive, with less use of verbs and adjectives. There is a greater use of one word utterances and the [[pragmatics]] uses supportive language like expansions and re-casting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revisionworld.com/a2-level-level-revision/english-language/child-language-acquisition/child-directed-speech|title=Child Directed Speech {{!}} a2-level-level-revision, english-language, child-language-acquisition, child-directed-speech {{!}} Revision World|website=revisionworld.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gricean maxims ==
Paul Grice (1989) came up with four maxims necessary in order to have a collegial conversation in which utterances are understood:

#'''Maxim of Quantity''': provide the right amount of information needed for that conversation
#'''Maxim of Quality''': provide information that is true
#'''Maxim of Relation''': provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand
#'''Maxim of Manner''': give order to your utterances throughout conversation, be clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mako |first=Okanda |year=2015 |title=Understanding violations of Gricean maxims in preschoolers and adults |pmc=4488609 |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=6 |page= 901|via=Frontiers Media SA |pmid=26191018 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Spector |year=2013 |title=Maxims of Conversation |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0129.xml#obo-9780199772810-0129-div1-0005 |journal=Oxford Bibliographies |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakhtin's theory of utterance==
According to philosopher  [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], there are four accepted properties that utterances should have:
* '''Boundaries''' – All utterances must be bounded by a "change of speech subject". This usually means, as previously mentioned, that they are bounded      by silence.
* '''Responsivity or dialogicity''' – The utterance must be either responding/following a previous utterance or generating dialogue.
* '''Finalization''' – An utterance must have a clear ending, and only occurs if the speaker has said everything he or she wishes to say.
* '''Generic form''' – The choice of the speech genre is determined based on the specific circumstances and sphere in which the dialogue occurs.

Bakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and a sentence are not the same thing. According to Bakhtin, sentences do not indicate a change of speech subject, and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances. According to him, the sentence as a language unit is grammatical in nature, while an utterance is "ethical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~jds/Bakhtin%20utterance.htm Utterance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vocabulary''' is a set of familiar [[words]] within a person's [[language]]. A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for [[communication]] and [[learning|acquiring knowledge]]. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a [[second language]].

== Definition and usage ==

Vocabulary is commonly defined as "all the words known and used by a particular person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88554&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knowing'' a word, however, is not as simple as merely being able to recognize or use it. There are several aspects of word knowledge that are used to measure word knowledge.

=== Productive and receptive knowledge ===

The first major distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve) or receptive (also called receive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person's receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well-known to barely known (see [[Vocabulary#Degree of knowledge|degree of knowledge]] below). A person's receptive vocabulary is the larger of the two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed. In this case, the child's receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but his or her active vocabulary is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child's active vocabulary begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.

Productive vocabulary, therefore, generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary. Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.

=== Degree of knowledge ===
Within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as ''degree of knowledge''. This simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt. Roughly, these stages could be described as:

# Never encountered the word.
# Heard the word, but cannot define it.
# Recognize the word due to context or tone of voice.
# Able to use the word and understand the general and/or intended meaning, but cannot clearly explain it.
# Fluent with the word – its use and definition.

=== Depth of knowledge ===

The differing degrees of word knowledge imply a greater ''depth of knowledge'', but the process is more complex than that. There are many facets to knowing a word, some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by ''degree of knowledge''. Several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept. One such framework includes nine facets:

# [[orthography]] – written form
# [[phonology]] – spoken form
# [[Referent|reference]] – meaning
# [[semantics]] – concept and reference
# [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] – appropriacy of use or cash register
# [[collocation]] – lexical neighbours
# [[word association]]s
# [[syntax]] – grammatical function
# [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] – word parts

=== Definition of word ===
Words can be defined in various ways, and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. The most common definition is that of a lemma (the uninflected or dictionary form; this includes ''walk'', but not ''walks, walked or walking''). Most of the time lemmas do not include proper nouns (names of people, places, companies, etc). Another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family. These are all the words that can be derived from a ground word (e.g., the words ''effortless, effortlessly, effortful, effortfully'' are all part of the word family ''effort''). Estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand, depending on the definition used. &lt;ref&gt;Brysbaert M, Stevens M, Mandera P and Keuleers E (2016) How Many Words Do We Know? Practical Estimates of Vocabulary Size Dependent on Word Definition, the Degree of Language Input and the Participant’s Age. Front. Psychol. 7:1116. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01116 [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01116/full]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of vocabulary ==

=== Reading vocabulary ===

A literate person's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading. This is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening.

=== Listening vocabulary ===

A person's [[listening]] vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech. People may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone, gestures, the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation.

=== Speaking vocabulary ===

A person's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in [[speech]]. It is likely to be a subset of the listening vocabulary. Due to the spontaneous nature of speech, words are often misused. This misuse, though slight and unintentional, may be compensated by facial expressions and tone of voice.

=== Writing vocabulary ===

Words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds. Many written words do not commonly appear in speech. Writers generally use a limited set of words when communicating.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} For example, if there are a number of synonyms, a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use, and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest.

== Focal vocabulary ==

Focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group: those with a particular focus of experience or activity. A lexicon, or vocabulary, is a language's dictionary: its set of names for things, events, and ideas. Some linguists believe that lexicon influences people's perception of things, the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. For example, the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] of Sudan have an elaborate vocabulary to describe cattle. The Nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle's particular histories, economies, and environments{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}. This kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy, as with the number of "[[Eskimo words for snow]]". English speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenkeit&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary growth ==
{{main|Vocabulary development}}
During its infancy, a child instinctively builds a vocabulary. [[Infant]]s imitate words that they hear and then associate those words with objects and actions. This is the [[Vocabulary#Listening vocabulary|listening vocabulary]]. The [[Vocabulary#Speaking vocabulary|speaking vocabulary]] follows, as a child's thoughts become more reliant on his/her ability to self-express without relying on gestures or babbling. Once the [[Vocabulary#Reading vocabulary|reading]] and [[Vocabulary#Writing vocabulary|writing vocabularies]] start to develop, through questions and [[education]], the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language.

In [[first grade]], a child who can read learns about twice as many words as one who cannot. Generally, this gap does not narrow later. This results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six, when an English-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words.&lt;ref&gt;"Vocabulary". Sebastian Wren, Ph.D. BalancedReading.com http://www.balancedreading.com/vocabulary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocabulary grows throughout our entire life. Between the ages of 20 and 60, people learn some 6,000 more lemmas, or one every other day.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; An average 20-year-old knows 42,000 words coming from 11,100 word families; an average 60-year-old knows 48,200 lemmas coming from 13,400 word families.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; People expand their vocabularies by e.g. reading, playing [[word game]]s, and participating in vocabulary-related programs. Exposure to traditional print media teaches correct spelling and vocabulary, while exposure to text messaging leads to more relaxed word acceptability constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type= M. A. |title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints |url=http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/48490/1/2011_Lee_MA.pdf |author=Joan H.

== Vocabulary size ==

=== Native-language vocabulary ===
Estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word, what is to know a word, what sample dictionaries were used, how tests were conducted, and so on.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nation|first1=I.

As a result estimates vary from as little as 10,000 to as many as over 50,000 for young adult native speakers of English.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goulden|first1=Robin|last2=Nation|first2=Paul|last3=Read|first3=John|title=How Large Can a Receptive Vocabulary Be?|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=1 December 1990|volume=11|issue=4|pages=341–363|doi=10.1093/applin/11.4.341|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1990-Goulden-Voc-size.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Anna|first1=Catherine|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Eugene|last3=Hall|first3=James|title=Toward a meaningful definition of vocabulary size|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 March 1991|volume=23|issue=1|pages=109–122|doi=10.1080/10862969109547729|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969109547729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milton|first1=James|last2=Treffers-Daller|first2=Jeanine|title=Vocabulary size revisited: the link between vocabulary size and academic achievement|journal=Applied Linguistics Review|date=29 January 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=151-172|doi=10.1515/applirev-2013-0007|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/29879/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One most recent 2016 study shows that 20-year-old English native speakers recognize on average 42,000 [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]], ranging from 27,100 for the lowest 5% of the population to 51,700 lemmas for the highest 5%. These lemmas come from 6,100 word families in the lowest 5% of the population and 14,900 word families in the highest 5%. 60-year-olds know on average 6,000 lemmas more.
&lt;ref name="HowMany2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brysbaert|first1=Marc|last2=Stevens|first2=Michaël|last3=Mandera|first3=Paweł|last4=Keuleers|first4=Emmanuel|title=How Many Words Do We Know?

According to another, earlier 1995 study junior-high students would be able to recognize the meanings of about 10,000–12,000 words, whereas for college students this number grows up to about 12,000–17,000 and for elderly adults up to about 17,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zechmeister|first1=Eugene|last2=Chronis|first2=Andrea|last3=Cull|first3=William|last4=D'Anna|first4=Catherine|last5=Healy|first5=Noreen|title=Growth of a functionally important lexicon|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 June 1995|volume=27|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1080/10862969509547878|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969509547878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native speakers of German average absolute vocabulary sizes range from 5,900 lemmas in first grade to 73,000 for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segbers|first1=J.|last2=Schroeder|first2=S.|title=How many words do children know?

=== Foreign-language vocabulary ===

==== The effects of vocabulary size on language comprehension ====
The knowledge of the 3000 most frequent English word families or the 5000 most frequent words provides 95% vocabulary coverage of spoken discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adolphs|first1=Svenja|last2=Schmitt|first2=Norbert|title=Lexical Coverage of Spoken Discourse|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2003|volume=24|issue=4|pages=425-438|url=https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/applij/24/4/10.1093/applin/24.4.425/2/240425.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For minimal reading comprehension a threshold of 3,000 [[Word family|word families]] (5,000 lexical items) was suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|editor1-last=Bejoint|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Arnaud|editor2-first=P.|title=Vocabulary and Applied Linguistics|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|pages=126-132|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259810338_How_Much_Lexis_is_Necessary_for_Reading_Comprehension|chapter=How Much Lexis is Necessary for Reading Comprehension?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|last2=Ravenhorst-Kalovski|first2=Geke C.|title=Lexical threshold revisited: Lexical text coverage, learners’ vocabulary size and reading comprehension|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=April 2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–30|url=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/rfl/April2010/articles/laufer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for reading for pleasure 5,000 word families (8,000 lexical items) are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh|first1=D.|last2=Nation|first2=I.S.P.|title=What vocabulary size is needed to read unsimplified texts for pleasure?|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=1992|volume=8|issue=2|pages=689-696|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1992-Hirsh-Vocabulary-reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "optimal" threshold of 8,000 word families yields the coverage of 98% (including proper nouns).&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010" /&gt;

==== Second language vocabulary acquisition ====
Learning vocabulary is one of the first steps in learning a second language, but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition. Whether in one's native language or a second language, the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process. There are many techniques that help one acquire new vocabulary.

==== Memorization ====
Although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring, associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition. By the time students reach adulthood, they generally have gathered a number of personalized memorization methods. Although many argue that memorization does not typically require the complex cognitive processing that increases retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006),&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"&gt;Sagarra, Nuria and Alba, Matthew. (2006). "The Key Is in the Keyword: L2 Vocabulary Learning Methods With Beginning Learners of Spanish". ''The Modern Language Journal'', 90, ii. pp. 228–243.&lt;/ref&gt; it does typically require a large amount of repetition, and [[spaced repetition]] with [[flashcard]]s is an established method for memorization, particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in [[computer-assisted language learning]]. Other methods typically require more time and longer to recall.

Some words cannot be easily linked through association or other methods. When a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language, one often assumes they also share [[semantic similarity|similar meanings]]. Though this is frequently the case, it is not always true. When faced with a [[false friend]], memorization and repetition are the keys to mastery. If a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary, that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends. When large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time, when the learner needs to recall information quickly, when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image, or when discriminating between false friends, rote memorization is the method to use. A neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies, accounting for L1-specific memorization abilities of L2-learners has recently been introduced (Hadzibeganovic and Cannas, 2009).&lt;ref name="novel word learning"&gt;Hadzibeganovic Tarik and Cannas, Sergio A. (2009). "A Tsallis' statistics-based neural network model for novel word learning". ''Physica A'', 388, pp. 732–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Keyword Method ====
One useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method. If time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words, one can create mnemonic devices or word associations. Although these strategies tend to take longer to implement and may take longer in recollection, they create new or unusual connections that can increase retention. The keyword method requires deeper cognitive processing, thus increasing the likelihood of retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; This method uses fits within Paivio's (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, A. (1986). ''Mental Representations: A Dual Coding Approach''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dual coding theory because it uses both verbal and image memory systems. However, this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things. Abstract concepts or words that do not bring a distinct image to mind are difficult to associate. In addition, studies have shown that associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; Older students tend to rely less on creating word associations to remember vocabulary.

=== Word lists ===

Several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication. These include [[Basic English]] (850 words), [[Special English]] (1,500 words), [[General Service List]] (2,000 words), and [[Academic Word List]]. Some [[Advanced learner's dictionary|learner's dictionaries]] have developed [[Defining vocabulary|defining vocabularies]] which contain only most common and basic words. As a result word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaards|first1=Paul|title=The evolution of learners’ dictionaries and ''Merriam-Webster’s Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary''|journal=Kernerman Dictionary News|date=July 2010|issue=18|pages=6-15|url=http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000 Oxford 3000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/learn/clear-definitions.html The Macmillan Defining Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Some publishers produce dictionaries based on word frequency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Frequency-Dictionaries/book-series/RFD Routledge Frequency Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; or thematic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grundwortschatz Langenscheidt Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grund-und-Aufbauwortschatz Langenscheidt Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [https://shop.hueber.de/de/catalogsearch/result/?q=Grundwortschatz Hueber Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Apollo 11 map notations.jpg|thumb|right|Notes on a map written with a felt-tip pen by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] while in orbit around the Moon]]
Several instruments have been used to write in [[outer space]], including different types of [[pencil]]s and [[pen]]s. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions.

A common [[urban legend]] states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the conditions experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was developed independently by a private organization in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that NASA spent thousands of dollars developing a space pen, whereas the Russians just took a pencil?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/apollo-nasa-pen.asp|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fisher Space Pen|url=https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html|publisher=Steve Garber, NASA History Web Curator|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov testing out his first Fisher Space Pen back in 1968 | url=http://www.pinterest.com/pin/71987294015259014/ | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission requirements==
Space versus ground recordkeeping presents several serious issues:

===Contamination control===
{{main|Contamination control}}
{{also|Apollo 1}}
As with submarines before them, space capsules are closed environments, subject to strict contamination requirements. Incoming material is screened for mission threats.  Any shedding, including wood, graphite, and ink vapors and droplets, may become a risk.  In the case of a manned capsule, the much smaller recirculating volume, combined with [[microgravity]] and an even greater difficulty of resupply, make these requirements even more critical.

Release of wood shavings, graphite dust, broken graphite tips, and ink compounds are a dangerous flight hazard.  Lack of gravity makes objects drift, even with air filtration.  Any conductive material is a threat to electronics, including the electromechanical switches in use during early manned space programs.  Nonconductive particles may also hamper switch contacts, such as normally-open and rotary mechanisms.  Drifting particles are a threat to the eyes (and to a lesser extent an inhalation threat), which may risk execution of a critical procedure.  Personnel may don protective gear, but both ground and flight crews are more comfortable and more productive "[[Shirt-sleeve environment|in shirtsleeves]]".  Paul C. Fisher of Fisher Pen Company recounts that pencils were 'too dangerous to use in space'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Pen History | url = http://www.allwrite.com/Space-Pen-History.html | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the [[Apollo 1|Apollo 1 fire]], the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|CM crew cabin]] was reviewed for hazardous materials such as paper, velcro, and even low-temperature plastics.  A directive was issued but poorly enforced.  When combined with high oxygen [[Partial pressure|content]], the Apollo 1 cabin burned within seconds, killing all three crew members.

Cosmonaut [[Anatoly Solovyev]] flew with Space Pens starting in the '80s and states "pencil lead breaks...and is not good in space capsule; very dangerous to have metal lead particles in zero gravity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Just the FAQ Ma'am | url = http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | accessdate = October 4, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224752/http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | archivedate = October 4, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission assurance and quality records===
{{main|Mission assurance}}
{{also|Life-critical system|System engineering}}
Strict documentation requirements accompany anything as complex as a large-scale aerospace demonstration, let alone a manned spaceflight.  [[Quality assurance records]] document individual parts, and instances of procedures, for deviances.  Low production and flight rates generally result in high variance; most spacecraft designs (to say nothing of individual spacecraft) fly so infrequently that they are considered [[experimental aircraft]].  When combined with the stringent [[Mass ratio|weight drivers]] of orbital and deep-space flight, the quality-control demands are high.  [[Change control]] records track the evolution of hardware and procedures from their ground testing, [[Flight test|initial flights]], through [[Shakedown (testing)|necessary corrections]] and midlife revision and upgrades, and on to [[Organizational memory|retention of engineering knowledge]] for later programs, and any [[Forensic science|incident investigations]].

When the flight also has scientific or engineering science objectives, [[Dirty data|low-quality data]] may affect mission success directly.

Faced with these requirements, pencils or other non-permanent recordkeeping methods are unsatisfactory.  The act of taking [[Transparency (behavior)|permanent, high-integrity documentation]] itself deters [[kludge]]s, [[workaround]]s, and "[[go fever]]".  The Apollo 1 investigation uncovered procedural and workmanship deficiencies in multiple areas, up to procedures on the pad.

===Pressure and temperature===

At sea level, temperature is moderated by the thick atmosphere.  As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically.  Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, to decrease the stresses (and thus, mass) of their [[Pressure vessel|capsules]].  Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times.  Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures.  While the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] had a {{convert|14.7|psi|abbr=on}} design pressure, and could use its [[orbital module]] as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned [[Zond program|lunar missions]].  In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental depressurizations), provide a [[Factor of safety|margin]], and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.

==Pre-existing writing instruments==
The wood [[pencil]] has been used for writing by [[NASA]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs from the start. It is simple with no moving parts, except for the [[pencil sharpener|sharpener]]. However, wood, graphite, and rubber (in the [[eraser]]) are all [[combustible]] and create dust. Graphite, in particular, both burns and produces dust that conducts [[electricity]].

The [[mechanical pencil]] has been used by NASA starting in the 1960s [[Gemini program]]. It can be made to be as wide as the width of astronauts' gloves, yet maintain its light weight. There are no wooden components which might catch fire and create dust. However, the pencil lead still creates graphite dust that conducts electricity.

[[Grease pencil]]s on plastic slates were used by the Soviet space program as an early substitute for wood pencils. It is simple with no moving parts. The paper shroud is peeled back when needed. The disadvantage is that the paper wrapper has to be disposed of. Writing done with the grease pencil is also [[Data integrity|not as durable]] as ink on paper.

[[Ballpoint pen]]s have been used by Soviet and then Russian space programs as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with graphite pencils and grease pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to [[outgassing]] and [[Viscosity|temperature variations]].

[[Marker pen|Felt-tip pens]] were used by NASA astronauts in the [[Apollo missions]].  However, wick-based instruments are designed around low viscosity, and thus [[operating temperature]] and pressure.

==Writing instruments specifically intended for space writing==
The Fisher Space Pen is a gas-charged ball point pen that is rugged and works in a wider variety of conditions, such as [[zero gravity]], [[vacuum]] and extreme temperatures. Its [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] ink and vent-free cartridge release no significant vapor at common temperatures and low pressures. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), and it functions at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m) and at temperatures from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). However, it is more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives. It has been used by both NASA and Soviet/Russian astronauts on [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]], [[Mir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ...
