*Assessment - This step involves collecting data pertinent to the patient, including nutrition-related History, anthropometric Measurements, biochemical data, nutrition-focused physical findings, client history and comparative standards.
*Diagnosis - Based on the assessment data collected, a nutrition problem may be diagnosed. Causes and contributing factors are identified. 
*Intervention - Based on the nutrition diagnosis, problems are addressed that aid in alleviation of the diagnosis’ signs and symptoms. Activities are constructed to enable the patient to work towards objectives set for them by themselves and their nutrition professional. 
*Monitoring/Evaluation - Progress made on goals and/or expected outcomes is tracked to ensure that nutrition problems are being addressed; adjustments in the Intervention step are made according to progress.&lt;ref name="Boyle2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie A.

'''Adventist Health Studies''' (AHS) is a series of long-term [[Biomedical research|medical research]] projects of [[Loma Linda University]] with the intent to measure the link between [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[disease]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

Seventh-day Adventists have a lower risk than other Americans of certain diseases, and many researchers hypothesize that this is due to dietary and other lifestyle habits.
This provides a special opportunity to answer scientific questions about how diet and other health habits affect the risk of suffering from many chronic diseases.&lt;ref

Two studies on Adventist health involving 24,000 and 34,000 [[California]]n Adventists were conducted over the last 40 years.
Although not sponsored by the Adventist church itself, the church is supportive of the studies.
These studies have been the subject of significant national media coverage on programs such as ''[[World News with Charles Gibson|ABC News: World News Tonight]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and in the ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' feature article "Longevity: The Secrets of a Long Life".&lt;ref

There is a third larger ongoing study that includes Adventists throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

== Studies ==

=== Adventist Mortality Study ===
The first major study of Adventists began in 1960, and has become known as the Adventist Mortality Study. Consisting of 22,940 California Adventists, it entailed an intensive 5-year follow-up and a more informal 25-year follow-up.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...[The] Adventist Mortality Study (1960–1965) did indicate that Adventist men lived 6.2 years longer than non-Adventist men in the concurrent [[American Cancer Society]] Study and Adventist women had a 3.7-year advantage over their counterparts. These statistics were based on life table analyses."&lt;ref

&lt;/ref&gt;
*Death rates from all cancers was 40% lower for Adventist men and 24% lower for Adventist women
*Lung cancer 79% lower
*Colorectal cancer 38% lower
*Breast cancer 15% lower
*Coronary heart disease 34% lower for Adventist men, 2% lower for Adventist women

=== Adventist Health Study 1 (AHS-1) ===
An additional study (1974–1988) involved approximately 34,000 Californian Adventists over 25 years of age. Unlike the mortality study, the purpose was to find out which components of the Adventist lifestyle give protection against disease.

The data from the study have been studied for more than a decade and the findings are numerous – linking diet to cancer&lt;ref name="AHS1-cancer"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically: &lt;ref name=report2008vp5/&gt;
*On average Adventist men live 7.3 years longer and Adventist women live 4.4 years longer than other Californians.
*Five simple health behaviors promoted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for more than 100 years (not [[smoking]], eating a [[Vegetarianism|plant based diet]], eating [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] several times per week, [[Physical exercise|regular exercise]] and maintaining normal [[body weight]]) increase life span up to 10 years.
*Reducing consumption of red and white meat was associated with a decrease of [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].
*Eating [[legumes]] was protective for colon cancer.
*Eating nuts several times a week reduces the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] by up to 50%.
*Eating whole meal bread instead of white bread reduced non-fatal heart attack risk by 45%.
*Drinking 5 or more glasses of [[Drinking water|water]] a day may reduce [[heart disease]] by 50%.
*Men who had a high consumption of tomatoes reduced their risk of [[prostate cancer]] by 40%.
*Drinking soy milk more than once daily may reduce prostate cancer by 70%.

===Adventist Health Air Pollution Study (ASHMOG)===
This is a sub-study of AHS-1. It began in 1976 and is still being conducted. It includes 6,328 Adventists from California.
The study was funded by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].

The study linked the effects of various indoor and outdoor pollutants with respiratory diseases and lung cancer.

=== Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) ===
The current study which began in 2002 with a goal of 125,000 Adventists continues to explore the links between lifestyle, diet and disease among the broader base of Seventh-day Adventists in America and Canada. As of May 2006 it had an enrollment of 96,741.&lt;ref name="AHS2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Gary Fraser with a team of researchers from the School of Public Health at Loma Linda University is conducting the study which is funded by the [[National Cancer Institute]].
In July 2011, National Institutes of Health awarded AHS-2 a $5.5 million 5-year grant to continue the study.&lt;ref name="HCN"&gt;{{cite web

While the study is on-going, some findings have been reported:
*"The 5-unit BMI difference between vegans and nonvegetarians indicates a substantial potential of vegetarianism to protect against obesity. Increased conformity to vegetarian diets protected against risk of type 2 diabetes after lifestyle characteristics and BMI were taken into account. Pesco- and semi-vegetarian diets afforded intermediate protection."&lt;ref name="NIH1"&gt;{{cite journal

===Adventist Religion &amp; Health Study (AHRS)===
This sub-study of AHS-2 began in 2006 and is funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]].
It is also known as the Biopsychosocial Religion and Health Study (BRHS).

The study has exceeded its goal of 10,000 participants with 11,835 subjects as of 2008.&lt;ref name="report2008vp5"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6924">The '''Centre for Reviews and Dissemination''' (CRD) is a health services research centre based at the [[University of York]], [[England]]. CRD was established in January 1994, and aims to provide research-based information for [[evidence-based medicine]]. CRD carries out [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of healthcare interventions, and disseminates the results of research to decision-makers in the [[National Health Service|NHS]]. 

CRD produces three databases:

* Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)
* NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED)
* Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA Database)

These are freely available from the CRD database website [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/] and as part of the [[Cochrane Library]].

CRD also publishes a number of regular reports including ''Effective Health Care'' and ''Effectiveness Matters''.

CRD is funded by the UK [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health's]] NHS Research and Development Programme, as well as from a number of other sources.

==History==

CRD was established in 1994. Along with the UK [[Cochrane Centre]], the 
Centre was originally created as part of the Information Systems 
Strategy of the NHS Research and Development Programme.

The original aims of the centre were:

* To carry out and commission systematic reviews of research findings on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of health care relevant to the NHS
* To improve the accessibility of these and other research reviews by maintaining and updating an international register of research reviews and providing a single access point to this information for enquirers in the NHS
* To provide simple and effective mechanisms by which the results of systematic reviews on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of health service interventions can be communicated rapidly to relevant audiences

Professor [[Trevor Sheldon]] established and directed CRD from 1994 to 1998. He was followed as director by Professor Jos Kleijnen from 1998 to 2005. The current director is Professor Lesley Stewart who took up appointment in 2006.

==About==

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) is part of the [[National Institute for Health Research]] (NIHR) and is a department of the [[University of York]]. CRD is one of the largest groups in the world engaged exclusively in evidence synthesis in the health field. The Centre comprises health researchers, medical information specialists, health economists and a [[dissemination]] team.

CRD undertakes systematic reviews evaluating the research evidence on health and public health questions. The findings of CRD reviews are widely disseminated and have impacted on health care policy and practice, both in the UK and internationally.

CRD produce the DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases which are used by health professionals, policy makers and researchers. 

CRD also undertake methods research and produce internationally accepted guidelines for undertaking systematic reviews.

The Centre's role in developing research evidence to support decision making in policy and practice was highlighted in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091015201227/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/pbr06_cooksey_final_report_636.pdf Cooksey report on UK health research funding] and subsequently in the Government national research strategy [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4127127 Best Research for Best Health]. CRD was also recognised by [[the Lancet]] [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2806%2968974-5/fulltext] as part of NHS R&amp;D's most important contribution to the UK science base, namely building systematic review capacity and promulgating systematic reviews as a global public good.

==Funding &amp; partners==

CRD receives core funding through the NIHR. This funding enables the centre to function as a national resource and provides the necessary infrastructure to respond to requests from policy makers and healthcare professionals, and to support the provision and promotion of the online databases (DARE, NHS EED and HTA ).

In addition to the core funding, the Centre has undertaken independent research for a number of different agencies including:

* [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE)
* [[NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme]] (HTA)
* [[Department of Health]] Policy Research Programme (PRP)
* [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC)
* [[Home Office]]
* [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] (MRC)
* [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]] (SCIE)
* [[NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement]] (NHS III)
* [[NIHR Service Delivery &amp; Organisation Programme]] (SDO)

CRD is one of seven independent academic centres currently undertaking reviews commissioned by [[NICE]]. CRD collaborate with the [[Centre for Health Economics]] at the [[University of York]] to undertake technology assessment reviews that inform [[NICE]] Technology Appraisals on the use of new and existing medicines and treatments within the [[National Health Service|NHS]].

CRD also has close links with the [[UK Cochrane Centre]] and contributes to the work of several of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]]’s Review and Methods groups. The Centre also has representation on the Steering and User groups of the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and is a member of the [[International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment]] (INAHTA).

CRD is a founder member of the [[Public Health Research Consortium]] (PHRC) with brings together researchers from 11 UK institutions. The PHRC aims to strengthen the evidence base for public health, with a strong emphasis on tackling socioeconomic inequalities in health. The centre is collaborating on a number of projects and is providing support for information retrieval and the knowledge transfer activities of the Consortium.

==Soil-transmitted helminthiasis==
{{Main|Soil-transmitted helminthiasis}}

[[Soil-transmitted helminthiasis]] is a [[neglected tropical disease]] as a result of infection of [[intestinal parasite]]s such as roundworm (''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]''), whipworm (''[[Trichuris trichiura]]''), hookworms (''[[Ancylostoma duodenale]]'' and ''[[Necator americanus]]''), and pinworm/threadworm (''[[Strongyloides stercoralis]]''). Most prevalent in the impoverished [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of [[Subsaharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[China]], where [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] are poor, the disease is an enormous burden on humanity, amounting to 135,000 deaths every year, and persistent infection of more than two billion people.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite book|author =WHO|year= |title=Eliminating Soil-transmitted Helminthiasis as a Public Health Problem in Children: Progress Report 2001–2010 and Strategic Plan 2011–2020 |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503129_eng.pdf |publisher= WHO Press, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland |pages=1–78 |isbn= 978-92-4-150312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |year=2012|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e1582|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001582|title=A research agenda for helminth diseases of humans: the problem of helminthiases|vauthors=Lustigman S, Prichard RK, Gazzinelli A, Grant WN, Boatin BA, McCarthy JS, Basáñez MG |pmid=22545164 |pmc=3335854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term impact is even worse. In these regions, the disease is the single most debilitating cause of [[mental retardation|intellectual]] and [[Delayed milestone|physical retardation]]. Thus it remains a relentless factor of backwardness in [[economic stagnation|socio-economic]] and [[human development (humanity)|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bethony J, Brooker S, Albonico M, Geiger SM, Loukas A, Diemert D, Hotez PJ |year=2006 |pmid=16679166 |title=Soil-transmitted helminth infections: ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm| url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68653-4|journal=The Lancet|volume=367|issue=9521 |pages=1521–1532|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68653-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yap P, Fürst T, Müller I, Kriemler S, Utzinger J, Steinmann P |year=2012 |title= Determining soil-transmitted helminth infection status and physical fitness of school-aged children|journal= Journal of Visualized Experiments| volume= 66 |issue= |pages= e3966| doi=10.3791/3966|pmid=22951972 |pmc=3486755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Boatin BA, Basáñez MG, Prichard RK, Awadzi K, Barakat RM, García HH, Gazzinelli A, Grant WN, McCarthy JS, N'Goran EK, Osei-Atweneboana MY, Sripa B, Yang GJ, Lustigman S |year=2012 |title= A research agenda for helminth diseases of humans: towards control and elimination|journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis| volume= 6 |issue=4 |pages= e1547|url= | doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001547|pmid=22545161|pmc= 3335858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

CWW basically is an aim to control STH in children by:&lt;ref name=ifpma/&gt;&lt;ref name=task&gt;{{cite web|author=The Task Force for Global Health|title=Our Work: Children Without Worm|year=2013|url=http://www.taskforce.org/our-work/programs/children-without-worms|work=taskforce.org|publisher=|accessdate=2013-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513012828/http://www.taskforce.org/our-work/programs/children-without-worms|archivedate=2013-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Supporting recipient countries in reducing STH infections as a public health and child development problem in accord with the 2001 resolution of the [[World Health Assembly]] by donating [[mebendazole]] for children in order to reduce associated morbidities, enhance education and promote development.
#Encouraging recipient countries to establish a comprehensive and sustainable STH control policy that combines [[mass deworming]] with the promotion of health education and improvements in sanitation and safe water supplies.
#Increasing the use of effective partnerships at the country level.

==Strategy of Action==

CWW targets children of school age through a slogan called the WASHED Framework, which includes systematic promotion of provision of water, sanitation, [[health education|hygiene education]], and [[mass deworming|deworming]]. Since helminth infections are not easily controlled by a simple treatment regime at a specific target level, CWW made a coordinated plan to improve:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= CWW |title=A Comprehensive Strategy for STH Control|date=31 January 2012| url= http://children-without-worms.ugal.com/how-we-target-STH/#WASHED%20Framework|work= children-without-worms.ugal.com |publisher=Children Without Worms  |accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Gallo K |title=Handwashing: Is it really all that simple?|date=15 October 2011| url= http://endtheneglect.org/tag/children-without-worms/|work= End the Neglect |publisher= |accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Water - Access to [[potable water|drinking water]] for hand-washing and cleaning of foodstuffs to prevent or minimize reinfection.
#Sanitation – Hygienic [[toilets]] and [[Septage|fecal sludge]] management keep infected human [[faeces|excreta]] from human activities, thereby minimizing the risk of reinfection in treated individuals and preventing new infections.
#Hygiene Education - It promotes personal and environmental hygiene in communities where infection is endemic, thus reducing the recurrent infections.
#Deworming - Treatment with broad-spectrum [[anthelmintic]] drugs like [[albendazole]] and [[Vermox]] ([[mebendazole]]) effectively eliminates the intestinal worms, thus the most effective component of the action.

===Implementation of action===

CWW oversees the donation of anthelmintics to the Ministries of Health and Education in eight recipient countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Cameroon, [[Cape Verde]], [[Lao PDR]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zambia]]. The annual donation consists of 200 million tablets of mebendazole from Johnson &amp; Johnson, and 400 million tablets of albendazole from GlaxoSmithKline, and these are estimated for the treatment of up to 300 million children twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Johnson &amp; Johnson|title=A Comprehensive Strategy for STH Control|date=1997–2013| url= http://www.jnj.com/connect/caring/corporate-giving/preventing-disease/intestinal-worms|work= jnj.com |publisher= Johnson &amp; Johnson Services, Inc.|accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= 7 Billion Action |title= Improving the health of the world's children through deworming |year= 2011 |url= http://7billionactions.org/organization/940-improving-the-health-of-the-worlds-children-through-deworming |work= 7billionactions.org |publisher= UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund |accessdate= 2013-05-31 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130806073339/http://7billionactions.org/organization/940-improving-the-health-of-the-worlds-children-through-deworming |archivedate= 2013-08-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The London Declaration==

'''Clinical research''' is a branch of [[healthcare science]] that determines the safety and effectiveness ([[efficacy]]) of [[medications]], [[Medical device|devices]], [[diagnostics|diagnostic products]] and [[medical treatment|treatment regimens]] intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment.

==Overview==
The term "clinical research" refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test article (including its safety [[toxicity]] if applicable and [[efficacy]], if possible at this early stage) are studied.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchmedics.com/ |title=Professional Medical Writing |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lcighdfv?url=http://researchmedics.com/ |archivedate=October 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news1309&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20130916/Adaptive-Clinical-Trials-for-Overcoming-Research-Challenges.aspx |title=Adaptive Clinical Trials for Overcoming Research Challenges |publisher=News-medical.net |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], when a test article is unapproved or not yet cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ([[FDA]]), or when an approved or cleared test article is used in a way that may significantly increase the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks), the data obtained from the pre-clinical studies or other supporting evidence, case studies of off label use, etc. are submitted in support of an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application&lt;ref&gt;FDA Page last updated 27 October 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/applications/ind_page_1.htm Investigational New Drug (IND) Application]&lt;/ref&gt; to the FDA for review prior to conducting studies that involve even one human and a test article if the results are intended to be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA at any time in the future (in the case of an already approved test article, if intended to submit or hold for inspection by the FDA in support of a change in labeling or advertising). Where devices are concerned the submission to the FDA would be for an [[Investigational Device Exemption]] (IDE) application if the device is a significant risk device or is not in some way exempt from prior submission to the [[FDA]]. In addition, clinical research may require [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) and possibly other institutional committee reviews, Privacy Board, Conflict of Interest Committee, Radiation Safety Committee, Radioactive Drug Research Committee, etc. approval whether or not the research requires prior submission to the FDA. Clinical research review criteria will depend on which federal regulations the research is subject to (e.g., ([[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) if federally funded, FDA as already discussed) and will depend on which regulations the institutions subscribe to, in addition to any more stringent criteria added by the institution possibly in response to state or local laws/policies or accreditation entity recommendations. This additional layer of review (IRB/REB in particular) is critical to the protection of human subjects especially when you consider that often research subject to the FDA regulation for prior submission is allowed to proceed, by those same FDA regulations, 30 days after submission to the FDA unless specifically notified by the FDA not to initiate the study.

Clinical research is often conducted at academic medical centers and affiliated research study sites. These centers and sites provide the prestige of the academic institution as well as access to larger metropolitan areas, providing a larger pool of medical participants. These academic medical centers often have their internal [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] that oversee the ethical conduct of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical research ecosystem involves a complex network of sites, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions. This has led to a growing field of technologies used for managing the data and operational factors of clinical research. Clinical research management is often aided by [[eClinical]] systems to help automate the management and conducting of [[clinical trials]].

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) acts in a similar fashion for studies conducted in their region. These human studies are conducted in four phases in research subjects that give [[consent]] to participate in the [[clinical trials]].

==Phases==
{{main|Phases of clinical research}}
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate [[clinical trial]]. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

Phase I includes 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the disease/condition. This study typically lasts several months and its purpose is safety and dosage. Phase II includes larger number of individual participants ranging 100-300, and phase III includes Approximately 1000-3000 participants to collect more data about the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics|title=The Basics|website=National Institutes of Health|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of drugs advance to the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=|first=|website=www.fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]].

[[Construction]] work is a hazardous land-based job. Some construction site jobs include:  building houses, roads, tree forts, workplaces and repair and maintain infrastructures. This work includes many hazardous task and conditions such as working with height, excavation, noise, dust, power tools and equipment. The most common fatalities are caused by the fatal four: falls, being struck by an object, electrocutions, and being caught in between two objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSHA Data &amp; Statistics / Commonly Used Statistics|url=https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html|website=osha.gov|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/construction/|title=CDC - Construction Safety and Health - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction work has been increasing in developing and undeveloped countries over the past few years. With an increase in this type of work occupational fatalities have increased. [[Occupational fatality|Occupational]] fatalities are individuals who die while on the job or performing work related tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Siddhartha|date=6 June 2015|title=Occupational fatalities in the construction sector: A medico-legal viewpoint|url=|journal=Medicolegal Journal|doi=10.1177/0025817214554869|pmid=|volume=83|pages=93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of construction it is important to have safe construction sites.

In deciding the risk precautions, the employer has to provide different degrees of protection. Where one task happens to be more dangerous than another, a greater degree of care has to be taken, but where the employer cannot eliminate the dangerous task, reasonable precautions are needed to reduce the risk according to Nguyen Van Vinh v Cheung Ying Construction Engineering Ltd (2008). This does not, however, imply that an employer is required to remove every risk. The Lord Oaksey commented in Winter v Cardiff Rural District Council (1950) stated that “but this does not mean that an employer must decide on every detail of the system of work or mode of operation. There is a sphere in which the employer must exercise his discretion and there are other spheres in which foremen and workmen must exercise theirs....With regard to the decision how safety precaution has to be taken frequently, it should be left to the foreman or workmen on the site. Whilst the immediate employer of the employee is liable for safety, Morris v. Breaveglen (1993) ruled that the principal contractor cannot escape from his liability. The general employers argued that they should not be liable for the injuries as they were not exercising direct control over the workers. However, judges invalidated such contention in Rainfield Design &amp; Associates Ltd v Siu Chi Moon (2000), “[t]he purpose of the Regulations was clearly to provide for the safety of workman and the primary responsibility for this must rest with the contractor responsible for the site. Even where a subcontractor had a contractual duty to provide plant and equipment, the contractor responsible for the site would not be relieved from its duty under the Regulations.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rita Yi Man|first=Li|last2=Poon|first2=Sun Wah|title=Workers' compensation for non-fatal accidents: review of HongKong court cases|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304195662_Workers%27_compensation_for_non-fatal_construction_accidents_Review_of_Hong_Kong_court_cases|journal=Asian Social Science|volume=5|issue=11|pages=15-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three generations of construction safety informatics==
Li (2019) proposes that there are three generations of construction safety informatics which are relevant to construction safety enhancement:

1. The first generation of construction safety informatics consisted of technologies that relied completely on control by human beings; for example, structural equation modelling requires the work of an analyst.

2. The second generation of construction safety informatics included smart features such as the Internet of Things which can send information to human operators, without human intervention — from sensors, etc. Yet, these “smart” tools cannot learn and improve on their own capabilities.

3. The third generation of construction safety informatics uses state-of-the-art AI, to mimic human behavior and think, act, learn and improve on its own decision making. All that is required is that the relevant information is fed to these systems, so that they can be ‘taught’ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rita Yi Man|first=Li|title=Construction safety informatics, 2019, Springer, Singapore|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811357602#aboutBook|pages=1-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction fatality rates ==
In 2014, the [[United States]] had 4,679 fatal occupational injuries, an [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence rate]] of 3.3 per 100,000 full-time employed workers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2014|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, fatal work injuries in construction and extraction occupations increased 5%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One in five deaths of workers in 2014 were construction related.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Construction has about 6% of U.S. workers, but 17% of the fatalities - the largest number of fatalities reported for any industry sector. In the [[United Kingdom]], the construction industry is responsible for 31% of fatalities at work and 10% of major workplace injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/industry/construction/index.htm|title=HSE - Construction Industry Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] there are 150 fatalities and approximately 400 injuries each year related to construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectin.co.za/about-safety/33-deaths-and-accidents-in-the-construction-industry-they-can-be-prevented.html|title=Deaths and accidents in the construction industry can be reduced|last=robbie|website=www.protectin.co.za|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], the incidence rate for all occupational fatalities is 3.6 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendeloff|first=John|date=2015|title=Occupational Safety and Health in Brazil|url=|journal=RAND Labor &amp; Population|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Little to no information regarding construction fatalities could be found in Asia, South American, Africa, and the Antarctic.)

==Nature of hazards==

===Hazards to construction workers===
[[File:Workplace Safety Signs.jpg|thumbnail|right|Various workplace safety signs commonly used at construction sites and industrial work environments]]
The leading safety hazards on construction sites include falls, being caught between objects, electrocutions, and being struck by objects.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm|title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary, 2014|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hazards have caused [https://www.mccannwallinjurylaw.com/delaware/construction-site-accidents/ injuries] and deaths on construction sites throughout the world. Failures in hazard identification are often due to limited or improper training and supervision of workers.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kines|first=Pete|last2=Andersen|first2=Lars P. S.|last3=Spangenberg|first3=Soren|last4=Mikkelsen|first4=Kim L.|last5=Dyreborg|first5=Johnny|last6=Zohar|first6=Dov|date=2010-10-01|title=Improving construction site safety through leader-based verbal safety communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437510000769|journal=Journal of Safety Research|volume=41|issue=5|pages=399–406|doi=10.1016/j.jsr.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where there is limited training include tasks in design for safety, safety inspection, and monitoring safety.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Failure in any of these areas can result in an increased risk in exposing workers to harm in the construction environment.

Falls are the leading cause of injury in the construction industry, in particularly for elder and untrained construction workers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Xiuwen Sue|last2=Wang|first2=Xuanwen|last3=Daw|first3=Christina|date=2012-06-01|title=Fatal falls among older construction workers|journal=Human Factors|volume=54|issue=3|pages=303–315|issn=0018-7208|pmid=22768635|doi=10.1177/0018720811410057}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) Handbook (29 CFR) used by the United States, fall protection is needed in areas including but not limited to ramps, runways, and other walkways; excavations; hoist areas; holes; form-work; leading edge work; unprotected sides and edges; overhand bricklaying and related work; roofing; precast erection; wall openings; floor openings such as holes; residential construction; and other walking/working surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=STANDARDS&amp;p_toc_level=1&amp;p_keyvalue=Construction|title=Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR)|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other countries have regulations and guidelines for fall protections to prevent injuries and deaths.

Motor vehicle crashes are another major safety hazard on construction sites. It is important to be cautious while operating motor vehicles or equipment on the site. A motor vehicle should have a service brake system, emergency brake system, and a parking brake system. All vehicles must be equipped with an audible warning system if the operator chooses to use it. Vehicles must have windows and doors, power windshield wipers, and a clear view of site from the rear window.  All employees should be properly trained before using motor vehicles and equipment.

Employees on construction sites also need to be aware of dangers on the ground. Cables running across roadways were often seen until cable ramp equipment was invented to protect hoses and other equipment which had to be laid out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dte/library/electrical/electrical.pdf|title=Electrical|publisher=OSHA|work=OSHA.Gov|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common hazard that workers may face is overexposure to heat and humidity in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slatergrant.com/wesley-chapel-construction-site-injuries-lawyer/|title=Wesley Chapel Construction Site Injury Lawyer {{!}} Common Construction Site Injuries|last=|first=|date=|website=Slater {{!}} Grant|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion in this type of weather can lead to serious heat-related illnesses such as [[heat stroke]], [[heat exhaustion]], and [[heat cramps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatstress/heat_illnesses.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Occupational Heat Exposure - Heat-related Illnesses and First Aid {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hazards found on construction site include [[asbestos]], [[solvents]], [[Noise (environmental)|noise]], and manual handling activities.&lt;ref name="NIOSHblog2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/|title=Women’s Health at Work|last2=Tisdale-Pardi|first2=Julie|date=13 May 2013|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|last3=MacDonald|first3=Leslie|last4=Tiesman|first4=Hope M.|accessdate=21 January 2015|first1=Naomi|last1=Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Temporary Fencing.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Temporary fencing on a building site in Sydney, Australia]]

=== Education and safety  ===
Construction workers need to be properly trained and educated on the task or job before working, which will assist in preventing injuries and deaths. There are many methods of training construction workers. One method is coaching construction site foremen to include safety in their daily verbal exchanges with workers to reduce work-related accidents.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; It is important that the workers use the same language to assure the best communication. In recent years, apart from traditional face to face safety knowledge sharing, mobile apps also make knowledge sharing possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-12430-8|title=Rita Yi Man Li, Construction Safety and Waste Management, Springer 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is ensuring that all workers know how to properly use electronics, conveyors, [[Skid-steer loader|skid-steer]], trucks, [[aerial lift]]s, and other equipment on the construction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionequipment.com/osha-hazard-alert-scissor-lift-safety|title=OSHA Hazard Alert: Scissor Lift Safety Construction Equipment|website=www.constructionequipment.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment on the job site must be properly maintained and inspected regularly before and after each shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/house.html|title=Workplace Housekeeping - Basic Guide : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment inspection system will help the operator make sure that a machine is mechanically sound and in safe operating conditions. An employee should be assigned to inspect equipment to insure proper safety. Equipment should have lights and reflectors if intended for night use.  The glass in the cab of the equipment must be safety glass in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10767|title=Equipment. - 1926.600|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkH2BwAAQBAJ|title=Construction Inspection Handbook: Quality Assurance/Quality Control|last=O'Brien|first=James J.|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475711912|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment must be used for its intended task at all times on the job site to insure workers' safety.

Each construction site should have a construction site manager. This is an occupational health and safety specialist who designs and implements safety regulations to minimize injuries and accidents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructioneducation.com/|title=ConstructionEducation.com|website=www.constructioneducation.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He or she also is in charge of conducting daily safety audits and inspections to ensure compliance with government regulations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most construction site managers have an entry level experience or higher degree.

Before any excavation takes place, the contractor is responsible for notifying all applicable companies that excavation work is being performed. During excavation, the contractor is responsible for providing a safe work environment for employees and pedestrians. 

Access and egress are also important parts of excavation safety.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/construction/trenching/competent_person.html|title=Trenching and Excavation Guide for Daily Inspection of Trenches and Excavations - Competent Person|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramps used by equipment must be designed by a person qualified in structural design.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; No person is allowed to cross underneath or stand underneath any loading or digging equipment. Employees are to remain at a safe distance from all equipment while it is operational. Employees who have training and education in the above areas will benefit their co-workers and themselves on the construction site.

===Road construction safety===
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created over 12,600 road construction projects, over 10,000 of which are currently in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Jennifer E., and David E. Fosbroke, [http://www.workzonesafety.org/files/documents/news_events/wz_conference_2010/injury_hazard_Fosbroke_Lincoln.pdf "Injury Hazards in Road and Bridge Construction"], International Bridge Conference Pittsburgh, PA, June 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in highway work zones are exposed to a variety of hazards and face risk of injury and death from construction equipment as well as passing motor vehicles. Workers on foot are exposed to passing traffic, often at high speeds, while workers who operate construction vehicles are at risk of injury due to overturn, collision, or being caught in running equipment. Regardless of the task assigned, [[construction worker]]s work in conditions in poor lighting, poor visibility, inclement weather, congested work areas, high volume traffic and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2001-128/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Building Safer Highway Work Zones: Measures to Prevent Worker Injuries From Vehicles and Equipment (2001-128)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were a total of 119 fatal occupation fatalities in road construction sites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2010 there were 37,476 injuries in work zones; about 20,000 of those were to construction workers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.workzonesafety.org/crash_data/occupational_injuries |title=Occupational Injuries in Work Zones {{!}} WorkZoneSafety.org |date=2015-09-07 |access-date=2016-11-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907211437/https://www.workzonesafety.org/crash_data/occupational_injuries |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Causes of road work site injuries included being struck by objects, trucks or mobile equipment (35%), falls or slips (20%), overexertion (15%), transportation incidents (12%), and exposure to harmful substances or environments (5%). Causes of fatalities included getting hit by trucks (58%), mobile machinery (22%), and automobiles (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/facts_stats/injuries_fatalities.htm|title=Work Zone Facts and Statistics|last=[[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]]|website=www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media safety campaigns ====
Road construction safety remains a priority among workers.  Several states have implemented campaigns addressing construction zone dangers and encouraging motorists to use caution when driving through work zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}http://tuvizo.com/reflective-vests-for-motorists-effective/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/media_gallery/2008/workzone_safety/ |title=Delaware Department of Transportation - Media Gallery |date=2014-07-11 |access-date=2016-11-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711183705/http://www.deldot.gov/information/media_gallery/2008/workzone_safety/ |archivedate=2014-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

National Work Zone Safety Awareness Week is held yearly.  The national event began in 1999 and has gained popularity and media attention each year since.  The purpose of the event is to draw national attention to motorist and worker safety issues in work zones.

== Preventing accidents and improving safety ==
[[File:A construction framer talks about protecting his crew from falls.webm|thumb|A video describing how a construction framer implemented a safety program to prevent falls on construction sites]]
Site preparation aids in preventing injury and death on construction sites. Site preparation includes removing debris, leveling the ground, filling holes, cutting tree roots, and marking gas, water, and electric pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civilengineersforum.com/construction-site-preparation-work/|title=Site Preparation Work - How To Prepare a Site For Construction|website=Civil Engineers Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another prevention method on the construction site is to provide a scaffold that is rigid and sufficient to carry its own weight plus four times the maximum intended load without settling or displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3252/3252.html|title=Worker Safety Series - Construction|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ways to prevent injuries and improve safety include:'''
* Management safety
* Integrate safety as a part of the job
* Create accountability at all levels
* Take safety into account during the project planning process
* Make sure the contractors are pre-qualified for safety
* Make sure the workers are properly trained in appropriate areas
* Have a fall protection system
* Prevent and address substance abuse to employees
* Make safety a part of everyday conversation
* Review accidents and near misses, as well as regular inspections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safetyproresources.com/blog/11-steps-to-improving-safety-culture-in-the-construction-industry|title=11 Steps to Improving Safety Culture in the Construction Industry|last=Roux|first=Lance|website=www.safetyproresources.com|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovative safety training, e.g. adoption of virtual reality in training&lt;ref name="springer.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811057700#aboutBook|title=An Economics analysis on automated construction safety: Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and 3D Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Replace some of the works by robots (many workers may worry that this will decrease their employment rate)&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt;
* Adoption of BIM with three dimensional printing to make the building model first before put into real practice&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt;

The employees or employers are responsible for providing fall protection systems and to ensure the use of systems. [[Fall protection]] can be provided by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, positioning device systems, and warning line systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/electric_power/ppe_fallprotectionequipment.html|title=Electric Power eTool: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - Fall Protection Equipment|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making sure that [[ladder]]s are long enough to safely reach the work area to prevent injury. Stairway, treads, and walkways must be free of dangerous objects, debris and materials. A  registered professional [[engineer]] should design a protective system for [[trench]]es 20 feet deep or greater for safety reasons. To prevent injury with [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, they should be inspected for any damage. The operator should know the maximum weight of the load that the crane is to lift. All operators should be trained and certified to ensure that they operate forklifts safely.

Each safety driver mentioned above has some sub-elements attributed to it.

=== Personal protective equipment ===

[[Hard hat]]s, [[steel-toe boot]]s and [[reflective safety vests]] are perhaps the most common personal protective equipment worn by construction workers around the world. A [[risk assessment]] may deem that other protective equipment is appropriate, such as [[glove]]s, [[goggles]], or [[high-visibility clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=EU Law for the Construction Industry|last=Dalby|first=Joseph|date=1998-02-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-632-04067-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards to non-workers===
Many construction sites cannot completely exclude non-workers. Road construction sites must often allow traffic to pass through. This places non-workers at some degree of risk.

[[Image:Sign Road Work Ahead.jpg|right|thumb|This sign and advisory plate penetrated the wind-shield and roof of a car in a side-impact test crash. A safer sign would have stiffer uprights, no advisory plate and the flashing light would be moved to the point of the sign to spread the impact force.]]

Road construction sites are blocked off and traffic is redirected. The sites and vehicles are protected by signs and barricades. However, sometimes even these signs and barricades can be a hazard to vehicle traffic. For example, improperly designed barricades can cause cars that strike them to roll over or even be thrown into the air. Even a simple safety sign can penetrate the windshield or roof of a car if it strikes from certain angles.

The majority of deaths in construction are caused by hazards relating to construction activity. However, many deaths are also caused by non construction activities, such as electrical hazards. A notable example of this occurred when Andy Roberts, a father of four, was killed in 1988 in New York while changing a light bulb at a construction site when he came into contact with a loose bare wire that was carrying two thousand volts of electricity and died.. Events like this have motivated the passing of further safety laws relating to non construction activities such as electrical work laws.

==Applicable laws==
Under [[European Union Law]], there are [[European Union Directive]]s in place to protect workers, notably Directive 89/391 (the Framework Directive) and Directive 92/57 (the Temporary and Mobile Sites Directive). This legislation is transposed into the Member States and places requirements on employers (and others) to assess and protect workers health and safety.

===Europe===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) is responsible for standards enforcement, while in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland]] (HSENI) is responsible. In [[Ireland]], the [[Health and Safety Authority]] (HSA) is responsible for standards and enforcement.

In Europe, the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] coordinates actions at the EU and national levels and the [[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion]] is responsible for regulation at the EU level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actions to improve safety and health in construction|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/magazine/7|work=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) sets and enforces standards concerning workplace safety and health. Efforts have been made in the first decade of the 21st century to improve safety for both road workers and drivers in construction zone. In 2004, Title 23 Part 630 Subpart J of the Code of Federal Regulations was updated by Congress to include new regulations that direct state agencies to systematically create and adopt comprehensive plans to address safety in road construction zones that receive federal funding.&lt;ref name="gpo.gov3"&gt;[[Federal Highway Administration]] [[United States Department of Transportation|DOT]], [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-09-09/pdf/04-20340.pdf "Work Zone Safety and Mobility &gt; Final rule"], ''[[Federal Register]] Vol.  69,  No.  174'',  September 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

OSHA implemented the Final Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, which went into effect January 1, 2017. It requires employers to submit incident data electronically to OSHA. This data will enable OSHA to use enforcement and compliance assistance resources more efficiently. The amount of data required varies by company and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/finalrule/|title=Final Rule Issued to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debunkify''' is a campaign established in July 2006 aimed at dispelling [[tobacco]] and [[secondhand smoke]] misconceptions in the state of [[Ohio]]. A mobile marketing tour, complete with a Debunkify-branded vehicle and a team of brand ambassadors, canvassed Ohio on a 10-month run, with the aim of debunking tobacco myths and correcting tobacco misconceptions at each of its stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtap.com/news/headlines/5278201.html|title=Debunkify Mobile Tour|author=AbKidder|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout June 2007, 17 participating standTunz artists battled it out online for a chance to play at the Myth Farewell Tour Main Event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cd101.com/sections/events/picturepages/picture_page.asp?pp_id=1198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

Although digital therapeutics can be employed in numerous ways, the term can broadly be defined as a treatment or therapy that utilizes digital and often [[Internet]]-based health technologies to spur changes in patient behavior.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dietitian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Yeager| first=David| title =Fighting Chronic Disease With Digital Therapeutics| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Today's Dietitian''| date =November 2014 | url =http://www.todaysdietitian.com/enewsletter/enews_1114_01.shtml| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of digital products to improve health outcomes dates as far back as 2000&lt;ref name="Frontiers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webb |first=Thomas L. |last2= Joseph|first2=Judith| last3=Yardley |first3=Lucy| last4=Michie| first4= Susan| date=17 February 2010 |title=Using the Internet to Promote Health Behavior Change: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Impact of Theoretical Basis, Use of Behavior Change Techniques, and Mode of Delivery on Efficacy |url=http://www.jmir.org/2010/1/e4/ |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages= e92|doi=10.2196/jmir.4052 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term itself has been in use since around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn85765357&amp;docId=FTK20121101070417#docIndex=4&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of the term in a peer-reviewed research publication was in 2015, in which Dr. Cameron Sepah formally defined the field as: "Digital therapeutics are evidence-based behavioral treatments delivered online that can increase accessibility and effectiveness of health care."&lt;ref name="JMIR01" /&gt; Digital therapeutics can be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with more conventional treatments like pharmacological or in-person therapy.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; As of 2018, digital therapeutics continues to be an evolving field that medical professionals, students, and patients are beginning to utilize.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Ber |first=Jeanne M. |last2=Lombardo |first2=Nancy T.| last3=Wimmer |first3=Erin | date=22 January 2015|title=Building Technology Services That Address Student Needs |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |journal=Medical Reference Services Quarterly|publisher= |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages= 1–16|doi=10.1080/02763869.2015.986708 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used as a preventive measure for patients who are at risk of developing more serious conditions. For instance, a patient with [[prediabetes]] may be prescribed digital therapeutics as a method to change their diet and behavior that could otherwise lead to a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNTime"/&gt; Digital therapeutics can also be used as a treatment option for existing conditions. For instance, a patient with type II diabetes can use digital therapeutics to manage the disease more effectively.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;

The methodology uses a variety of digital implements to help manage, monitor, and prevent illnesses in at-risk patients. These include [[mobile devices]] and technologies, [[Mobile app|apps]], sensors, [[desktop computers]], and various [[Internet of Things]] devices.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kvedar| first=Joseph| title =It’s time to break free of the traditional paradigms of disease management| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Med City News| date =25 August 2016 | url =http://medcitynews.com/2016/08/time-break-free-traditional-paradigms-disease-management/| accessdate =19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These implements can collect a wide variety of data, ranging from [[Big data|big]] to small. Digital therapeutics can theoretically collect a high volume of data from a variety of sources. It also collects "smaller" data, "capturing personalized physiological parameters, behavior patterns and social and geographical patterns that can be recorded from multiple digital sources."&lt;ref name="Drug"/&gt;

==Methodologies==

Digital therapeutics can be used for a variety of conditions. There is no single methodology used in the practice of digital therapeutics. It uses methods rooted in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] to spur patients to make lifestyle changes. The method can be used to manage and prevent numerous conditions, including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, congestive heart failure, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], asthma, [[lung disease]], obesity, substance abuse, ADHD, [[insomnia]], [[panic attack]]s, anxiety, depression, and others.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNDigit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahlberg |first=Leif E. |last2= Grahn |first2=Daniel| last3=Dahlberg |first3=Jakob E. |last4=Thorstensson |first4= Carina A.| date=2016 |title=A Web-Based Platform for Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Hip and Knee: A Pilot Study |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leif_Dahlberg/publication/303801480_A_Web-Based_Platform_for_Patients_With_Osteoarthritis_of_the_Hip_and_Knee_A_Pilot_Study/links/5756a3ac08aec74acf5acd9d.pdf |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= e115|doi=10.2196/resprot.5665 |access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodologies can be as simple as sending notifications designed to alter behavior to patients who are at risk of obesity or diabetes&lt;ref name="Fortune01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt; and as complex as administering an ingestible radio tag that communicates with an external sensor to monitor the efficacy of a given medication.&lt;ref name="Forbes01"/&gt; Diabetes and obesity prevention and management is a major focus in the field of digital therapeutics.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willey |first=Steven |last2=Walsh|first2=James K.| date=8 January 2016 |title=Outcomes of a Mobile Health Coaching Platform: 12-Week Results of a Single-Arm Longitudinal Study |journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|publisher= |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= e3|doi=10.2196/mhealth.4933 |pmid=26747611 |pmc=4723727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vlachopapadopoulou |first1=Elpis |last2=Fotiadis |first2=Dimitrios I. |editor-last=Moumtzoglou |editor-first=Anastasius |title=M-Health Innovations for Patient-Centered Care |publisher=IGI Global |date=26 January 2016 |orig-year= |pages=126–146 |chapter=Chapter 7: The Contribution of mHealth in the Care of Obese Pediatric Patients |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fQB6CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Digital+therapeutics%22&amp;ots=dfrCtFMlHe&amp;sig=sTxVvATahb5uy3gDfszcE4V1-Mk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Digital%20therapeutics%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1466698611 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connected devices like [[insulin pump]]s, [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]], and wearable gadgets can all send data to a unified system. The therapy also uses self-reported data like diet or other lifestyle factors.&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; It is also often used to monitor the potential for heart and lung conditions and change behaviors like smoking, poor diet, or a lack of exercise.&lt;ref name="MCNItsTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatureBio"/&gt;

Digital therapeutics can also be used to treat patients with psychological and neurological disorders. For example, patients with disorders like ADHD, depression, and anxiety can receive cognitive behavioral therapy via their mobile devices.&lt;ref name="MHNOverview"/&gt; One study looked at the efficacy of [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]-based therapeutic interventions to reduce depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="Avatar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pinto |first=Melissa D. |last2= Greenblatt |first2=Amy M.| last3=Hickman |first3=Ronald L. |last4=Rice |first4= Heather M.| last5=Thomas|first5=Tami L. |last6=Clochesy |first6=John M. | date=19 March 2015 |title=Assessing the Critical Parameters of eSMART-MH: A Promising Avatar-Based Digital Therapeutic Intervention to Reduce Depressive Symptoms |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppc.12112/abstract |journal= Perspectives in Psychiatric Care|publisher= |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= 157–168|doi=10.1111/ppc.12112 |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study demonstrated that a 4-week at-home treatment eliminated or reduced panic attacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Outcomes==

The general consensus among researchers in the field of digital therapeutics is that the discipline requires more clinical data and investigation to be fully evaluated.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; A variety of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and impact of behavior change techniques that utilize a digital platform, however.&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt; In a meta-analysis of 85 such studies comprising a total sample size of over 43,000 participants, researchers discovered that digital therapeutics have a "statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior." The study also showed that a broader use of theory, behavior change techniques, and modes of delivery (especially regular notifications) improved the efficacy of a given program.&lt;ref name="JMIR03"/&gt;

Individual studies have also showed some benefits for patients. For instance, a diabetes prevention program using digital therapeutics saw participants lose an average of 4.7% of baseline body weight after 1 year (4.2% after 2 years) and undergo a 0.38% reduction in [[Glycated hemoglobin|A1c]] levels after 1 year (0.43% after 2 years).&lt;ref name="JMIR01"/&gt; Another weight loss pilot program using digital therapeutics reported a mean weight loss of 13.5 pounds (or 7.3% of baseline) with a significant average drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (18.6 mmHg and 6.4 mmHg respectively). The study also saw a slight but statistically insignificant drop in total cholesterol, [[LDL]], [[triglycerides]], and A1c.&lt;ref name="JMIR04"/&gt;

The world's poor are significantly more likely to have or incur a [[disability]] within their lifetime compared to more financially privileged populations. The rate of disability within impoverished nations is notably higher than that found in more [[developed countries]]. Though no one explanation entirely accounts for this connection, recently{{since when?|date=August 2014}} there has been a substantial amount of research illustrating the cycle by which poverty and disability are mutually reinforcing. Physical, cognitive, mental, emotional, sensory, or developmental impairments independently or in tandem with one another may increase one's likelihood of becoming impoverished, while living in poverty may increase one's potential of having or acquiring special needs in some capacity.

==Extent==
[[File:Disable begger in Dhaka.JPG|thumbnail|Man with disabilities in Bangladesh]]
A multitude of studies have been shown to demonstrate a significant rate of [[disability]] among individuals living in [[poverty]]. People with disabilities were shown by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] to comprise 15 to 20 percent of the poorest individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."&gt;Elwan, A. (1999). Poverty and disability: A review of the literature. The World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Former World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]] has stated that this connection reveals a link that should be broken. He stated, “People with disabilities in developing countries are over-represented among the poorest people. They have been largely overlooked in the development agenda so far, but the recent focus on poverty reduction strategies is a unique change to rethink and rewrite that agenda.”&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;The World Bank. (2011). Poverty and disability. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:20193783~menuPK:419389~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The link between disability and development has been further stressed by [[Judith Heumann]], the World Bank's first advisor for international [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]], who indicated that of the 650 million people living with disabilities today eighty percent live in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov"&gt;The Office of Policy Planning and Public Diplomacy. (2012). Special advisor Heumann's remarks on inclusive development. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311193836/http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some research investigations with proved social impact are opening venues that lead to establish enabling factors to break the cycle of deprivation faced by poor people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00450|title=It also helped refine international approaches to the education of the disabled. [Social Impact]. RECOUP. Research Consortium on Educational Outcomes and Poverty (2005-2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department for International Development|United Kingdom Department for International Development]], 10,000 individuals with disabilities die each day as a result of extreme poverty, showing that the connection between these two constructs is especially problematic and deep-seated.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is also present in developed countries, with the Disability Funders Network reporting that in the United States alone those with disabilities are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than those without special needs.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy"&gt;Dickson, J. (2011). Philanthropy's Blind Spot: The Disability Rights Movement. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the World Bank, “Persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as less education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and higher poverty rates.”&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). Disability: Overview. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:21151218~menuPK:282706~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have demonstrated that these reduced outcomes may be attributed to a myriad of institutional barriers and other factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of disabilities in impoverished populations has been predicted to follow a cyclical pattern by which those who live in poverty are more likely to acquire a disability and those who have a disability are more likely to become impoverished.

===The vicious circle===
Experts from the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council attribute the connection between disability and poverty to many systemic factors that promote a “vicious circle.”&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics affirm the mutually reinforcing nature of special needs and low socioeconomic status, showing that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to become impoverished and people who are impoverished are significantly more likely to become disabled. Barriers presented for those with disabilities can lead individuals to be deprived of access to essential resources, such as opportunities for education and employment, thus causing them to fall into poverty. Likewise, poverty places individuals at a much greater risk of acquiring a disability due to the general lack of health care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe working conditions that the poor are subject to.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt;

Experts assert that this cycle is perpetuated mainly by the lack of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] afforded to those living in poverty. The few options available to the poor often necessitate that these individuals put themselves in harms way, consequently resulting in an increase in the acquisition of preventable impairments.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Living in poverty is also shown to decrease an individual's access to preventative health services, which results in an increase in the acquisition of potentially preventable disabilities. In a study by [[Oxfam]], the organization found that well over half of the instances of childhood blindness and hearing impairment in Africa and Asia were considered preventable or treatable.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, H. (1999). Discussion paper for Oxfam: Disability as a development issue and how to integrate a disability perspective into the SCO. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate released by Oxfam provides further evidence of this vicious circle, finding that 100 million people living in poverty suffer from impairments acquired due to malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Discrimination
Prejudice held against individuals with disabilities, otherwise termed [[ableism]], is shown to be a significant detriment to the successful outcomes of persons in this population. According to one study following the lives of children with disabilities in South Africa, the children in the sample described "discrimination from other metal children and adults in the community as their most significant daily problem."&lt;ref name="Clacherty"&gt;Clacherty, G., Matsha, K., &amp; Sait, W. (2004). How do children with disabilities experience poverty, disability, and service? Cape Town, South Africa: Idasa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional forms of discrimination may lead disability to be more salient in already [[social exclusion|marginalized]] populations. Women and individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups who have disabilities have been found to more greatly suffer from discrimination and endure negative outcomes. Some researchers attribute this to what they believe is a “double rejection” of girls and women who are disabled on the basis of their sex in tandem with their special needs.&lt;ref name="Coleridge"&gt;Coleridge, P. (1993). Disability, liberation, and development. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes that accompany both of these attributes lead females with disabilities to be seen as particularly dependent upon others and serve to amplify the misconception of this population as burdensome.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; In a study done by Oxfam, the societal consequences of having a disability while belonging to an already marginalized population were highlighted, stating, “A disabled women suffers a multiple handicap. Her chances of marriage are very slight, and she is most likely to be condemned to a twilight existence as a non-productive adjunct to the household of her birth… it is small wonder that many disabled female babies do not survive.”&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Additionally, women with disabilities are particularly susceptible to abuse. A 2004 UN survey in Orissa, India, found that every women with disabilities in their sample had experienced some form of physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "&gt;United Nations. (2012). Fact sheet on persons with disabilities. Webaccessed: http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This double discrimination is also shown to be prevalent in more industrialized nations. In the United States, for example, 72 percent of women with disabilities live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The intensified discrimination individuals with disabilities may face due to their sex is especially important to consider when taking into account that, according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], women report higher incidences of disability than men.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Furthermore, the connection between disability and poverty holds particular significance for the world's women, with females accounting for roughly 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (2010). Integrating poverty and gender into health programs. The World Health Organization Webaccessed: http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/Nutritionmodule2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional discrimination also exists as there are policies existing in organizations that result in inequality between a disabled person and non-disabled person. Some of these organizations systematically ignore the needs of disabled people and some interfere in their lives as a means of social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Colin|date=1994|title=Institutional discrimination, disabled people and inter professional care|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2014.969831|journal=Journal of Interprofessional Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=203-212|doi=10.3109/13561829409010420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Another reason individuals living with disabilities are often impoverished is the high [[health care|medical costs]] associated with their needs. One study, conducted in villages in South India, demonstrated that the annual cost of treatment and equipment needed for individuals with disabilities in the area ranged from three days of income to upwards of two years' worth, with the average amount spent on essential services totaling three months worth of income.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, S., &amp; Harriss-White, B. (2001). ''The Economic Impact and Developmental Implications of Disability and Incapacity in Adulthood: a village study in South India''. Cambridge: Welfare, Demography, and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not take into account the unpaid work of caregivers who must provide assistance after these procedures and the opportunity costs leading to a loss of income during injury, surgery, and rehabilitation.
Studies reported by medical anthropologists Benedicte Ingstad and Susan Reynolds Whyte have also shown that access to medical care is significantly impaired when one lacks mobility. They report that in addition to the direct medical costs associated with special needs, the burden of transportation falls most heavily on those with disabilities. This is especially true for the rural poor whose distance from urban environments necessitates extensive movement in order to obtain health services.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;Ingstad, B. &amp; Whyte, S. R. (2007). ''Disability in Local and Global Worlds''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these barriers, both economic and physical, it is estimated that only 2 percent of individuals with disabilities have access to adequate rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Despouy, 1993, Human Rights and Disabled Persons (Study Series 6), Centre for Human Rights Geneva and UN New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaccessibility of health care for those living in poverty has a substantial impact on the rate of disability within this population.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Individuals living in poverty face higher health risks and are often unable to obtain proper treatment, leading them to be significantly more likely to acquire a disability within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Financial barriers are not the only obstacles those living in poverty are confronted with. Research shows that matters of geographic inaccessibility, availability, and cultural limitations all provide substantial impediments to the acquisition of proper care for the populations of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. H., Garg, A., Bloom, G., Walker, D. G., Brieger, W. R., &amp; Rahman, H. (2008). "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Brieger2/publication/229569366_Poverty_and_Access_to_Health_Care_in_Developing_Countries/links/59e39a3a458515393d5b8faf/Poverty-and-Access-to-Health-Care-in-Developing-Countries.pdf Poverty and access to health care in developing countries]". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. doi:10.1196&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-specific ailments are particularly harmful for women living in poverty. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that each year 20 million women acquire disabilities due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth that could be significantly mitigated with proper pre-natal, childbirth, and post-natal medical care.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"&gt;DFID (2000). Disability, poverty, and development. The Department for International Development. Webaccessed: http://www.handicap-international.fr/bibliographie-handicap/4PolitiqueHandicap/hand_pauvrete/DFID_disability.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers to care are present in the lack of treatments developed to target [[diseases of poverty]]. Experts assert that the diseases most commonly affecting those in poverty attract the least research funding. This discrepancy, known as the [[10/90 gap]], reveals that only 10 percent of global health research focuses on conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, P. (2004) Diseases of poverty and the 10/90 gap. The World Health Organization. Webaccessed: http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without a redistribution in research capital, it is likely that many of the diseases known to cause death and disability in impoverished populations will persist.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

===Institutional barriers===
Researchers assert that institutional barriers play a substantial role in the incidence of poverty in those with disabilities.

====[[Accessibility]]====
Physical environment may be a large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie, R. (1996). Disability and the city: International perspectives. London: Chapman.&lt;/ref&gt; This "apartheid" has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt; Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="Clacherty"/&gt; Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of [[Braille]], [[sign language]] and shortage of audio tape availability for those who are blind and deaf.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt;

====Education====
The roots of unemployment are speculated to begin with discrimination at an early age. [[UNESCO]] reports that 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are denied access to formal education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, at least 40 million children with disabilities do not receive an education thus barring them from obtaining knowledge essential to gainful employment and forcing them to grow up to be financially dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; This is also reflected in a finding obtained by the [[World Development Report]] that 77 percent of persons with disabilities are illiterate.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."/&gt; This statistic is even more jarring for women with disabilities, with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] reporting that the global literacy rate for this population is a mere 1 percent.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; This may be attributed to the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, boys with disabilities are significantly more likely to receive an education than similarly abled girls.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"/&gt; Beyond simply the skills obtained, experts such as former World Bank advisor [[Judith Heumann]] speculate that the societal value of education and the inability of schools to accommodate special needs children substantially contributes to the discrimination of these individuals.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; It is important to note that the deprivation of education to individuals with special needs may not be solely an issue of discrimination, but an issue of resources. Children with disabilities often require [[Special education|specialized educational]] resources and teaching practices largely unavailable in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action on Disability and Development (1998). ADD Uganda annual report. Kampala: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
Some sociologists have found a number of barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. These may be seen in [[workplace discrimination|employer discrimination]], architectural barriers within the workplace, pervasive negative attitudes regarding skill, and the adverse reactions of customers.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, W.H., &amp; Wilder, E.I. (2005). Voices from the heartland: The needs and rights of individuals with disabilities. Brookline, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Edward Hall, "More disabled people are unemployed, in lower status occupations, on low earnings, or out of the labour market altogether, than non-disabled people."&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, R. &amp; Parr, H. (1999). Mind and body spaces: geographies of illness, impairment, and disability. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that roughly 386 million of the world's working age population have some form of disability, however, up to eighty percent of these employable individuals with disabilities are unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Statistics show that individuals with disabilities in both industrialized and developing countries are generally unable to obtain formal work. In India, only 100,000 of the country's 70 million individuals with disabilities are employed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; In the United States, 14.3 of a projected 48.9 million people with disabilities were employed, with two-thirds of those unemployed reporting that they were unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Similarly in Belgium, only 30 percent of persons with disabilities were able to find gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, R. (2000). [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf Disability issues, trends and recommendations for the World Bank]. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 45 percent of adults with disabilities were found to live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable data on the rate of unemployment for persons with disabilities has yet to be determined in most developing countries.

Sociologists Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer demonstrated that this exclusion of persons with disabilities from the paid labor market is a primary reason why the majority of this population experiences far greater levels of poverty and are more reliant on the financial support of others.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; In addition to the economic gains associated with employment, researchers have shown that participation in the formal economic sector reduces discrimination of persons with disabilities. One anthropologist who chronicled the lives of persons with disabilities in Botswana noted that individuals who were able to find [[informal sector|formal employment]] “will usually obtain a position in society equal to that of non-disabled citizens.”&lt;ref name="Ingstad"&gt;Ingstad, B. (1997). Community-based rehabilitation in Botswana. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the formal workplace is such a social space, the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from this realm is seen by some sociologists to be a significant impediment to social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Equity in employment has been strategized by some, such as sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters, to depend on heightened awareness of current barriers, wider use of assistive technologies that can make workplaces and tasks more accessible, more accommodating job development, and most importantly deconstructing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

Creating inclusive employment that better facilitates the participation of individuals with disabilities is demonstrated to have a significantly positive impact on not only the lives of these individuals, but also the economies of nations who implement such measures. The International Labour Organization estimates that the current exclusion of employable individuals with special needs is costing countries possible gains of 1 to 7 percent of their GDP.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;International Labour Office. (2012). Employment for social justice and a fair globalization: Overview of ILO Programmes. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_140958.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The relationship between disability and poverty is seen by many to be especially problematic given that it places those with the greatest needs in a position where they have access to the fewest resources. Researchers from the [[United nations|United Nations]] and the [[Yale School of Public Health]] refer to the link between disability and poverty as a manifestation of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the assumption that this population is a drain of resources leads society to deny them access to avenues of success. Such exclusion of individuals on the basis of their special needs in turn denies them the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that disprove these stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Chamie, M., Me, A., &amp; Groce, N.E. (2000). Measuring the quality of life: Rethinking the World Bank's disability adjusted life years. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914180312/http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |archivedate=2000-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam asserts that this negative cycle is largely due to a gross underestimation of the potential held by individuals with disabilities and a lack of awareness of the possibilities that each person may hold if the proper resources were present.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

The early onset of preventable deaths has been demonstrated as a significant consequence of disability for those living in poverty. Researchers show that families who lack adequate economic agency are unable to care for children with special medical needs, resulting in preventable deaths.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; In times of economic hardship studies show families may divert resources from children with disabilities because investing in their livelihood is often perceived as an investment caretakers cannot afford to make.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, B. (1999). Promoting the rights of the disabled children globally disabled children become adults: Some implications. Frome: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicte Ingstad, an anthropologist who studied families with a member with disabilities, asserted that what some may consider neglect of individuals with disabilities “was mainly a reflection of the general hardship that the household was living under."&lt;ref name="Ingstad" /&gt; A study conducted by Oxfam found that the rejection of a child with disabilities was not uncommon in areas of [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; The report went on to show that neglect of children with disabilities was far from a deliberate choice, but rather a consequence of a lack of essential resources. The study also demonstrated that services necessary to the well being of these children “are seized upon” when they are made available. The organization thus concludes that if families had the capacity to care for children with special needs they would do so willingly, but often the inability to access crucial resources bars them from administering proper care.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

==Current initiatives==
Initiatives on the local, national, and transnational levels addressing the connection between poverty and disability are exceedingly rare. According to the UN, only 45 countries throughout the world have anti-discrimination and other disability-specific laws.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Additionally, experts point to the Western world as a demonstration that the association between poverty and disability is not naturally dissolved through the development process. Instead, a conscious effort toward inclusive development is seen by theorists, such as Disability Policy expert Mark Priestley, as essential in the remediation process.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;Priestley, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrrpeMGQCLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Disability and the life course: Global perspectives]. NY, NY: University of Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights advocate [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] asserts that it is crucial to better incorporate the voices of individuals with disabilities into the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;Charlton, J.I. (2000). Nothing about us without us: Disability oppression and empowerment. London, England: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His literature on disability rights made popular the slogan, “Nothing about us without us,” evidencing the need to ensure those most affected by policy have an equitable hand in its creation. This need for agency is an issue particularly salient for those with special needs who are often negatively stereotyped as dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt; Furthermore, many who are part of the [[disability rights movement]] argue that there is too little emphasis on aid designed to eliminate the physical and social barriers those with disabilities face. The movement asserts that unless these obstacles are rectified, the connection between disability and poverty will persist.&lt;ref name=" Philanthropy "/&gt;

Employment is seen as a critical agent in reducing stigma and increasing capacity in the lives of individuals with disabilities. The lack of opportunities currently available is shown to perpetuate the vicious cycle, causing individuals with disabilities to fall into poverty. To address these concerns many recent initiatives have begun to develop more inclusive employment structures.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; One example of this is the Ntiro Project for Supported and Inclusive Employment.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"&gt;Parmenter,T.R.(2011). Promoting training and employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. International Labour Office. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_167316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located in South Africa, the project aims to eliminate the segragationist models prevalent in the country through coordinated efforts between districts, NGOs, and community organizations. The model stresses education and pairs individuals with intellectual disabilities with mentors until they have developed the skills necessary to perform their roles independently. The program then matches individuals with local employers. This gradualist model ensures that people who may have been deprived of the resources necessary to acquire essential skills are able to build their expertise and enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"/&gt;

The United Nations has been at the forefront of initiating legislation that aims to deter the current toll disabilities take on individuals in society, especially those in poverty. In 1982 the UN published the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]], which explicitly states "Particular efforts should be made to integrate the disabled in the development process and that effective measures for prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunities are therefore essential."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=23&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine set stage for the UN Decade of the Disabled Person from 1983 to 1992, where, at its close, the General Assembly adopted the [[Standard Rules of the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Rules encourages states to remove social, cultural, economic, educational, and political barriers that bar individuals with disabilities from participating equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (2012). The convention in detail. Webaccessed: {{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612120639/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=222 |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that these movements on behalf of the UN helped facilitate more inclusive development policy and brought disability rights to the forefront.&lt;ref name="dfid_a"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new poverty agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics assert that the relationship between disability and poverty may be overstated. Cultural differences in the definition of disability, bias leading to more generous estimates on behalf of researchers, and the variability in incidences that are not accounted for between countries are all speculated to be part of this mischaracterization.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; These factors lead some organizations to conclude that the projection asserting 10 percent of the global population belongs to the disabled community is entirely too broad. Speculation over the projection of a 10 percent disability rate has led other independent studies to collect varying results. The [[World Health Organization]] updated their estimate to 4 percent for developing countries and 7 percent for industrialized countries. [[USAID]] maintains the initial 10 percent figure, while the United Nations works off half of that rate with a projection of 5 percent.&lt;ref name="dfid" /&gt; The percentage of the world's population with disabilities remains a highly contested matter.

The argument that development should be channeled to better the agency of individuals with disabilities has been contested on several grounds. First, critics argue that development is enacted to harness potential that most individuals in this population do not possess.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Second, the case that health care costs for many persons with special needs are simply too great to be shouldered by the government or [[NGO]]'s has been made, especially with regard to emerging economies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that investing in an individual's rehabilitation will result in substantial change in their agency. Lastly is the proposition of priorities. It is argued that most countries in need of extensive development must focus on health ails such as infant mortality, diarrhea, and malaria that are widespread killers not limited to a specific population.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

Critique with respect to potential solutions has also been made. In regards to implementing change through policy, critics have noted that the weak legal standing of United Nations' documents and the lack of resources available to aid in their implementation have resulted in a struggle to achieve the goals set forth by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="dfid_a" /&gt; Other studies have shown that policy on a national level has not necessarily equated to marked improvements within these countries. One such example is the United States where sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters purport that “the employment of disabled individuals has increased only marginally since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.”&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; The smaller than anticipated impact of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] and other policy-based initiatives is seen as a critical flaw in legislation. This is because many issues surrounding disability, namely employment discrimination, are generally reconciled through the legal system necessitating that individuals engage in the often expensive process of litigation.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">An '''ethnic bioweapon''' (''biogenetic weapon'') is a type of theoretical [[bioweapon]] that aims to harm only or primarily people of specific ethnicities or [[genotype]]s.

== History ==
One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1942 novel ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (republished as ''The Day After Tomorrow''), in which a race-specific [[radiation]] weapon is used against a so-called "[[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]]" invader{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

=== Genetic weapons ===
In 1997, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] referred to the concept of an ethnic bioweapon as a possible risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Cohen|title=Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy|date=1997-04-28|work=Sam Nunn Policy Forum, University of Georgia|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|accessdate=2006-07-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118074748/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a "genetic weapon" plausible, and believed the former [[Soviet Union]] had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plague/interviews/davis.html Interview of Dr Christopher Davis, UK Defence Intelligence Staff], ''Plague War'', [[Frontline (TV series)|Frontline]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2000 policy paper [[Rebuilding America's Defenses]], think-tank [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) described ethnic bioweapons as a potentially "politically useful tool". PNAC went on to provide substantial staffing for the Bush Jr administration.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century'' |url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |date=September 2000 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817122719/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of a "genetic bomb" is presented in [[Vincent Sarich]]'s and [[Frank Miele]]'s book, ''[[Race: The Reality of Human Differences]]'', published in 2004. These authors view such weapons as technically feasible but not very likely to be used. (page 248 of paperback edition.)

In 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as "treatment to [[Alzheimer's]] and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the official view of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] was "The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/gas-protocol-100605.htm Preventing the use of biological and chemical weapons: 80 years on], Official Statement by Jacques Forster, vice-president of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], 10-06-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US government held a congressional committee, ‘Genetics and other human modification technologies: sensible international regulation or a new kind of arms race?’, during which it was discussed how “we can anticipate a world where rogue (and even not-so-rogue) states and non-state actors attempt to manipulate human genetics in ways that will horrify us”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebadgeronline.com/2018/05/ethic-bioweapons-conspiracy-reality/|title=Ethnic-bioweapons: between conspiracy and reality - The Badger|date=2018-05-08|work=The Badger|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the [[President of the United States]]. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine suggested the possibility of a virus used as an ethnic bioweapon that could [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] a "genetically-related ethnic population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/can-there-be-war-without-soldiers-weapons-cyberwarfare/|title=Can There Be War Without Soldiers?|last=Brooks|first=Rosa|date=2016-03-15|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli "ethno-bomb" controversy ==
In November 1998, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Israel was attempting to build an "ethno-bomb" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel planning 'ethnic' bomb as Saddam caves in|author=Uzi Mahnaimi|author2=Marie Colvin|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date=1998-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired News]]'' also reported the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel's Ethnic Weapon? |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,16272,00.html |date=1998-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9904,ridgeway,3697,6.html |title=Ethnic Warfare |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |author=James Ridgeway |date=1999-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Foreign Reports|Foreign Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9811&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=0&amp;P=28059 |title=UPI report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jeff|title=Debunking the “ethno-bomb”|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/02/news_154/|website=Salon|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'', describing the claims as "[[blood libel]]", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic [[Doron Stanitsky]]. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as "wholly fantastical", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now Playing: A Blood Libel For The 21st Century|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=1998-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/talk.politics.mideast/QJKAhCi8UY0/uTqlQUSv8goJ|title=Google Groups quoting Haaretz|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and no sources were ever identified. Neither of the authors of the ''Sunday Times'' story, [[Uzi Mahnaimi]] and [[Marie Colvin]], have spoken publicly on the matter{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

==Russian ban on export of biological samples==
In May 2007, a Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=769777|title=Россия блюдет человеческий образец
|date=2007-05-29|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[[Kommersant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] report about on-going development of "genetic bioweapons" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], American International Health Alliance, Department of Medical Biotechnology of Jagiellonian University, [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division]], Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology Warsaw University, and [[United States Agency for International Development]].

'''''Femalia''''' is a book of 32 full-color photographs of human [[vulva]]s, edited by [[Joani Blank]] and first published by [[Down There Press]] in 1993.{{r|Femalia-1993}} A [[reprint]] [[Edition (book)|edition]] was published by [[Last Gasp]] in 2011.{{r|Femalia-2011}} The photographs were taken by [[Tee Corinne]], Michael Perry, [[Jill Posener]], and Michael A. Rosen. The photographs are presented without commentary, except for Blank's brief introduction to the volume as a whole.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

== History ==

The word used as the book's title, ''[[Wiktionary:femalia|femalia]]'', was taken from the novel ''[[Vox (Nicholson Baker novel)|Vox]]'' by [[Nicholson Baker]].{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Baker-1992|p=143}} The photographs by Corinne and Perry had been taken years before the book's original publication in 1993; those by Posener and Rosen were taken specifically for inclusion in the first edition of ''Femalia''.{{r|Femalia-1993}}

''Femalia'' grew out of Blank's long-term work as a feminist sex educator. She felt that medical and pornographic images of the female genitals were inadequate to her purposes.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}} In her introduction to the first edition, Blank lamented the absence of readily available photographic representations of the vulva other than heavily edited images in male-oriented pornography, and the resulting feeling on the part of a majority of women that "in one way or another, their genitals are not quite ‘normal’".{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}}

== Feminist response ==

Feminist authors have sharply contrasted the portrayals of vulvas in ''Femalia'' with those in typical male-oriented [[pornography]] and in biomedical sources.{{r|Duncan-2005}} ''Femalia'''s portrayals are characterized as accurate, honest, open, and truthful, as exhibiting "stark reality";{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,362}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}} as promoting a positive view of the vulva;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015}} as emphasizing the diversity of the vulva in different women,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=166,202,360,379}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}}{{r|Green-2005|p=181}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Kitzinger-2001|p=264}} as well as the diversity of opinions and perspectives about the vulva on the part of both men and women;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}} and as emphasizing female autonomy.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=222}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Wilkinson-2001|p=25}} By contrast, portrayals of the vulva in pornography and in biomedical science are characterized as stylized and uniform, excluding women whose genitalia do not match their models.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,360}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}} Pornographic portrayals are further characterized as commodified,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=202}} and medical portrayals as sterile.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87}} Feminist sex educators have advocated perusal of the images in ''Femalia'' as an exercise to help women to regard their genitals in a more positive light.{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}}{{r|Savage-2014-12-03}}{{r|Warburton-2007|p=69}}

== Civil liberties ==

Librarian [[Sanford Berman]] has cited ''Femalia'' as an example to illustrate his thesis that libraries engage in inappropriate [[self-censorship]], often motivated by concerns about controversial sexual content, in deciding which books to stock.{{r|Berman-2000-04-16}}{{r|Berman-2001}} Berman comments, "A detailed, artistic picture of a seashell adorns the cover. Were the contents strictly shell photos, the book might make it into at least some libraries. Shells, yes. Vulvas, no."{{r|Berman-2001|p=51}}

In a study of systematic differences in the depiction of female genitals in online pornography, anatomy textbooks, and feminist publications, ''Femalia'' was used as one of three sources of sample depictions in the feminist-publications category.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=76}} This study found a statistically significant difference between online pornography and feminist publications in depicted protuberance of the [[labia minora]], with greater mean protuberance shown in the feminist publications.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77}} It also found greater variation in measured genital proportions shown in the feminist publications than in the other two categories of sources.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77–78}}

''Femalia'' was used as one of two sources of sample depictions of female genitals (the other was [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']]) in a psychological study of the relationship between women's aesthetic perceptions of female genitals and their attitudes toward [[Gynaecology|gynecological]] examinations.{{r|Schick-2010|p=21}} More specifically, the examinations in question were [[Pap test|Pap smears]], and the relevant attitudes were anxiety, embarrassment, and likelihood of making or keeping an appointment for a [[Pap test|Pap smear]].{{r|Schick-2010|p=22–24}}

=== Educational role in clinical practice ===

The [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]] (RACGP) has published a guideline document, authored by Dr. Magdalena Simonis under authority of the RACGP, intended to inform healthcare professionals about female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS), such as [[labiaplasty]], and to advise them about management of patient requests for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07}} In this document, Dr. Simonis identifies lack of appreciation of female genital diversity, not only on the part of the public but also on the part of healthcare professionals, as a contributing factor to the demand for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=2–6}} She advocates the use of ''Femalia'' as a tool for patient education about genital diversity,{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9,13}} in part because it depicts female genitals without digital enhancement.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9}} Dr. Simonis has further referenced this educational use of ''Femalia'' in slide and poster presentations intended to promote better management of the demand for FGCS on the part of healthcare professionals.{{r|Simonis-2015-09-23}}{{r|Simonis-2015-09-13-16}}

Medical anthropologist Eric Plemons has stated that:
:The feminist commitment to ostensibly unmediated representation of ‘natural’ female genitals is one whose value has also been recognized by medical experts; ''Femalia'' has had an unanticipated life in clinical literature.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}
Plemons documents the use of ''Femalia'' as a resource to demonstrate the existence of female genital diversity, and to educate both clinicians and patients as to the range of normal vulval appearance. He attributes its widespread use by healthcare professionals to their belief that "it is one of very few photographic collections of ‘normal’ vulvas that exists".{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

=== Transsexual genital cosmesis ===

''Femalia'' has been used as a way of assessing preferences for [[Perineum|perineal]] and genital cosmetic appearance, to improve [[cosmesis]] in male-to-female [[transsexual]]s ([[Trans woman|transwomen]]) undergoing genital [[sex reassignment surgery]] (GSRS).{{r|Plemons-2015}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Beginning in the year 2000, surgeon Neal Wilson began showing photographs from ''Femalia'' to his prospective GSRS patients and asking them to indicate which vulvas they found most aesthetically pleasing, as well as which ones they would choose for themselves. Dr. Wilson attempted to approximate through surgery the appearance of the photographs from ''Femalia'' selected by his prospective patients, even though he held that they set "impossible standards" because of the limitations of early 21st-century surgical technique.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=429}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Dr. Wilson has republished, in an online journal article, the three photographs most often selected by his patients. He has also provided summary statistics concerning his patients′ choices of vulval photographs from ''Femalia'', as well as a short narrative summary of the specific anatomical features that he believed to be characteristic of the most popular photographs.{{r|Wilson-2002}}

Semantic Web &amp; other Web 3.0 Concepts Explained in Plain English|work=Digital Inspiration|accessdate= December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the concept of the [[Semantic Web]], wherein websites' data is accessible for sorting in order to tailor the presentation of information based on user preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web|title=The Semantic Web|work=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health 3.0 will use such data access to enable individuals to better retrieve and contribute to personalized health-related information within networked electronic health records, and social networking resources.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=69404|title=Healthy Knowledge: Semantic Technology &amp; the Healthcare Revolution|author=Tony Shaw|date=17 August 2010|work=EContent Magazine|accessdate= December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=David B.|title=Health 3.0|journal=P&amp;T|year=2008|pmc=2730068|pmid=19749994|volume=33|issue=2|pages=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giustini, D. |date=2007|title= Web 3.0 and medicine: make way for the semantic web |journal= [[British Medical Journal]] |volume= 335 |pages=1273–1274|doi=10.1136/bmj.39428.494236.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health 3.0 has also been described as the idea of semantically organizing [[electronic health record]]s to create an Open Healthcare Information Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3957314.htm|title=SemTech 2010 Speaks Out About Health 3.0 -- Open Healthcare Information Architecture|date=5 May 2010|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care could also make use of social media, and incorporate virtual tools for enhanced interactions between health care providers and consumers/patients.&lt;ref name="ShachakJadad"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shachak A., Jadad A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Electronic Health Records in the Age of Social Networks and Global Telecommunications | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 303 | issue = 5| pages = 452–453 | doi=10.1001/jama.2010.63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

*Improved access to health related information on the web via semantic and networked resources will facilitate an improved understanding of health issues with the goal of increasing patient self-management, preventative care and enhancing health professional expertise.&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;
*Health 3.0 will foster the creation and maintenance of supportive virtual communities within which individuals can help one another understand, cope with, and manage common health-related issues.&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;
*Personalized social networking resources can also serve as a medium for health professionals to improve individuals' access to healthcare expertise, and to facilitate health professional-to-many-patients communication with the goal of improved acceptance, understanding and adherence to best therapeutic options.&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShachakJadad"/&gt;
*"Digital healing" has been described as a goal of health 3.0. It involves patients obtaining reassurance, support, and validation from others via social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/38246?page=all|title=Health 3.0: Baby Boomers, Social Media &amp; the Evolution of Digital Healing|author=Joseph F. Coughlin|work=Big Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Health 3.0 is recommended to be able to gather imparted data through web-based technologies. Consumers and experts are to be connected by virtual reasoning tools – an expert system. The expert system that can use the collected information through the web-based technologies represent health 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enhancedmd.com/EMD_VirtualReasonWP.pdf | title=Virtual Reasoning Redefining Healthcare Through Health 3.0 | publisher=Enhanced Medical Decisions Inc. | author=Marlene Beggelman | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815062906/http://www.enhancedmd.com/EMD_VirtualReasonWP.pdf | archivedate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current situation==

Social networking is a popular and powerful tool for engaging patients in their health care.

'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all communication related to health done on the [[Internet]].

==Types==
As a general communication channel, various Internet products serve every type of general health information.

===Targeting types of information to different audiences===
In the late 1990s researchers began to note that huge numbers of people were using the Internet to seek health information, despite various problems with the quality of information or inefficiencies in accessing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Risk | first1 = A. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 | title = Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–2715 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12020308| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various problems have been identified for those using [[search engines]] to seek health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berland | first1 = G.

There is a premise that patients with access to their personal health information presented in a form they can understand will be able to interpret and learn from this information in a way that benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=JS|author2=Intille, SS |author3=Morris, ME |title=To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e29|pmid=17236264|pmc=1794006|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians worry that patients using their own medical history records as a starting point for personal research on the Internet are at risk for being overwhelmed and misinformed when seeking health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robeznieks|first=A|title=Getting personal.

As of 2013 opinions about the relationship health care providers should have with online health information were still being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnan|first=Jeanne M.|title=Online Medical Professionalism: Patient and Public Relationships: Policy Statement From the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=16 April 2013|volume=158|issue=8|pages=620–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-8-201304160-00100|pmid=23579867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2014 study, "The flow of information has fundamentally changed, and physicians have less control over health information relayed to patients. Not surprisingly, this paradigm shift has elicited varied and sometimes conflicting views about the value of the Internet as a tool to improve health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonsaker|first=Tabitha|last2=Bartlett|first2=Gillian|last3=Trpkov|first3=Cvetan|date=2016-11-14|title=Health information on the Internet|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=60|issue=5|pages=407–408|issn=0008-350X|pmc=4020634|pmid=24828994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social media]] channels have been noted as places which physicians can visit to get insight on patient thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhoef|first=Lise M |author2=Van de Belt, Tom H |author3=Engelen, Lucien JLPG |author4=Schoonhoven, Lisette |author5=Kool, Rudolf B |title=Social Media and Rating Sites as Tools to Understanding Quality of Care: A Scoping Review|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|date=20 February 2014|volume=16|issue=2|pages=e56|doi=10.2196/jmir.3024|pmid=24566844 |pmc=3961699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients have increasingly turned to social media for health information, sometimes of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prybutok|first=Gayle|last2=Ryan|first2=Sherry|date=2015-04-01|title=Social media: the key to health information access for 18- to 30-year-old college students|journal=Computers, informatics, nursing: CIN|volume=33|issue=4|pages=132–141|doi=10.1097/CIN.0000000000000147|issn=1538-9774|pmid=25887107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=A.

====Background on the doctor–patient relationship====
{{main article|Doctor–patient relationship}}
Physicians have difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients have difficulty understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. One reasons for this is that a patient's visit to a physician is likely to be less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechanic|first=David|author2=McAlpine, Donna D. |author3=Rosenthal, Marsha |title=Are Patients' Office Visits with Physicians Getting Shorter?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 January 2001|volume=344|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1056/NEJM200101183440307|pmid=11172143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=CM|author2=Wilson, C |author3=Wang, F |author4= Schillinger, D |title=Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients|journal=American journal of health behavior|date=Sep–Oct 2007|volume=31 Suppl 1|pages=S85–95|pmid=17931142 |doi=10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that patients should have [[shared decision making]], which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock III|first=Clarence H.|author2=Edwards, Kelly A. |author3=Hasenberg, Nicole M. |author4=Laidley, Tracy L. |author5= Levinson, Wendy |title=Informed Decision Making in Outpatient Practice|journal=JAMA|date=22 December 1999|volume=282|issue=24|pages=2313–20|doi=10.1001/jama.282.24.2313|pmid=10612318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiscella|first=Kevin|author2=Epstein, Ronald M.|title=So Much to Do, So Little Time:care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=22 September 2008|volume=168|issue=17|pages=1843–52|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843|pmid=18809810|pmc=2606692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of patient understanding of health contributes to a range of problems including tendency to not adhere to the physician's medical advice and missing medical appointments.&lt;ref name="Wicks 2010"&gt;A better source should be used to support this claim, although this source is good enough for how it is used here.

Various social forums exist in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers. Such forums are especially popular among patients who seek to have conversations with other patients with a shared medical concern.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G.|title=Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions|journal=BMJ|date=15 May 2004|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1166–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166|pmid=15142921|pmc=411092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who participate in online communities which discuss health issues report feeling relief about their health worries, perceiving more control over their health and medical condition, having more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barak|first=Azy|author2=Boniel-Nissim, Meyran |author3=Suler, John |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic medical literature===
The written record of medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journals]]. Since the advent of [[electronic publishing]] there has been [[academic journal publishing reform]] which had a range of effects, including more researchers and physicians having greater access to professional information in medical journals through the Internet.

===Patients' personal health information===
Through various sources both publicly and privately available, datasets containing health information about large numbers of patients are available on the Internet to an extent which was impossible to manage before the Internet.

==Personal health information==
For many applications people wish to use health information on the Internet to give insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information described in a person's [[medical record]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the advent of [[electronic media]], medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} If electronic medical records were shared online then it would be easy to match those with information and conduct a range of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagliari|first=C|author2=Detmer, D |author3=Singleton, P |title=Potential of electronic personal health records.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 18, 2007|volume=335|issue=7615|pages=330–3|pmid=17703042|doi=10.1136/bmj.39279.482963.AD|pmc=1949437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all medical records are [[protected health information]] because sharing personal health information exposes an individual to a range of harms which result from violation of their [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There is currently broad international debate about how to balance patient and commercial medicine demands for personal health information with individual's needs for safety and respect.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Electronic medical records===
{{main article|Electronic medical record}}
An electronic medical record is a [[medical record]] stored as [[electronic media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=P. C|author2=Ash, J. S |author3=Bates, D.

===De-identification===
{{main article|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to divide a collection of information about a particular person so that all information which identifies the person is removed, and with intent to distribute whatever information is left. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]] the less valuable the data is to those who want it, so in general, data is only de-identified somewhat and rarely anonymized. There are many controversies in de-identification.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Research using personal health information===
There is a large demand for access to large collections of various types of personal health information.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Almost all of this demand is commercial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Distribution of collections of personal health information===
Various groups have expressed worry over danger to the public which results from the distribution of collections of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/data-protection-eu-anonymous |title=Data protection in the EU: the certainty of uncertainty |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom proposed to sell datasets of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy |title=NHS patient data to be made available for sale to drug and insurance firms |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=theguardian.com |date=19 January 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/care-data-nhs-healthcare |title=Thanks to Care.data, your secrets are no longer safe with your GP (Wired UK) |first=Asher |last=Wolf |work=wired.co.uk |date=7 February 2014|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human male sexuality''' covers [[physiology|physiological]], [[psychology|psychological]], [[interpersonal relationship|social]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[politics|political]] aspects of the [[human]] male [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response]] and related phenomena. It encompasses a broad range of topics involving male [[sexual desire]]s and [[human sexual activity|behavior]] that have also been addressed by [[ethics]], [[morality]], and [[religion]].

== Factors influencing male sexual behaviour ==
There are a number of factors that influence male sexuality and sexual behaviour, including expected parental investment, and paternal presence during development.

=== Expected paternal investment ===
Elizabeth Cashdan&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cashdan|first=Elizabeth|year=1993|title=Attracting mates: Effects of paternal investment on mate attraction strategies.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309593900149|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=14|pages=1–23|via=|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(93)90014-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that mate strategies among both genders differ depending on how much [[parental investment]] is expected of the male, and provided research support for her hypotheses. When men expect to provide a high level of parental investment, they will attempt to attract women by emphasising their ability to invest. In addition, men who expect to invest will be more likely to highlight their chastity and fidelity than men who expect not to invest. Men with the expectation of low parental investment will flaunt their sexuality to women. Cashdan argues the fact the research supports the idea that men expecting to invest emphasise their chastity and fidelity, which is a high cost strategy (because it lowers reproductive opportunities), suggests that that type of behaviour must be beneficial, or the behaviour would not have been [[Sexual selection|selected]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Early childhood experiences ===
A relationship between the early experiences and environment of boys, and their later sexual behaviour, has been drawn by several studies. Research suggests that father absence can lead to an increase in rape behaviour. Research conducted by Malamuth&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; found that men raised in the absence of their father (or where resources were scarce) reported more use of sexual coercion in the past, and were more likely to indicate being more willing to rape, in the event that there was no chance of them getting caught. Research has also found that parental [[divorce]] and rape correlate positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starks|first=Philip T.|date=2000-06-22|title=The relationship between serial monogamy and rape in the United States (1960–1995)|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/267/1449/1259|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=267|issue=1449|pages=1259–1263|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1136|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1690656|pmid=10902693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociosexuality ===
Males who are in a committed relationship, in other words have a restricted [[sociosexual orientation]], will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be less willing to have sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner.

It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratios]] (0.68–0.72).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brase|first=G.L.|last2=Walker|first2=G.|year=2004|title=Male sexual strategies modify ratings of female models with specific waist-to-hip ratios|url=|journal=Human Nature|volume=15 |issue=2|pages=209–224|via=|doi=10.1007/s12110-004-1020-x|pmid=26190413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age of first sexual intercourse ===
One study has several factors that influence the age of first [[sexual intercourse]] among both genders. Those from families with both parents present, from high socioeconomic backgrounds, who performed better at school, were more religious, who had higher parental expectations, and felt like their parents care, showed lower levels of sexual activity across all age groups in the study (age 13–18). In contrast, those with higher levels of body pride, showed higher levels of sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lammers|first=Cristina|last2=Ireland|first2=Marjorie|last3=Resnick|first3=Michael|last4=Blum|first4=Robert|date=2000-01-01|title=Influences on adolescents' decision to postpone onset of sexual intercourse: a survival analysis of virginity among youths aged 13 to 18 years|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X99000415|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=26|issue=1|pages=42–48|doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00041-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Male sexually violent strategies ==
There are many sexual strategies that males can employ in order to gain mates. This includes sexual coercion.

[[Sexual coercion]] is forcing mate choice against a partner's will or preference. Sexual coercion functions to increase the chance of a female mating with a male, and decrease the chance that the female will mate with another male.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smuts|first=B.B|last2=Smuts|first2=R.W.|year=1993|title=Male aggression and sexual coercion of females in nonhuman primates and other mammals: evidence and theoretical implications|url=|journal=Advances in the Study of Behaviour|volume=22|pages=1–63|via=researchgate.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several strategies by which sexual coercion can be achieved. These are [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], and forced copulation ([[rape]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T.H.|last2=Parker|first2=G.A.|year=1995|title=Sexual coercion in animal societies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347285701662|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1345–1365|via=sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1006/anbe.1995.0166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary explanations ===
Thornhill and Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' investigates the [[evolution]]ary causes of sexual coercion, particularly of rape, and suggest that such behaviour is a result of [[sexual selection]], rather than [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A natural history of rape: Biological bases of sexual coercion. |last=Thornhill |first=R |last2=Palmer |first2=C.T. | publisher=Bradford Books |year=2001 |isbn= |location=Cambridge, MA |pages= |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of ten listed [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], they accepted two reasonable hypotheses:
*The first, that rape is a by-product of an [[adaptation]] other than rape.
*The second, that rape as an adaptation (the rape specific adaptation hypothesis), which suggests that rape evolved because it was an adaptive, beneficial behaviour in the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptation]].

Thornhill and Palmer argue that these two theories are the strongest of the ten for several reasons. For example, both hypothesis argue rape exists because it functions to increase matings, thus improving reproductive success. Because rape can be a costly behaviour for the male – he risks injury inflicted by the victim, or punishment by her social allies, it must have strong reproductive benefits for the behaviour to survive and be demonstrated today. Thornhill and Palmer also use several facts to support the idea that the two evolutionary based hypotheses are the most reasonable. They argue that the fact that most rape victims are of childbearing age, that married women and women of childbearing age suffer more psychological distress after rape than single or postmenopausal women, and that rape takes place in a variety of other species, all point towards an evolutionary heritage for rape behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Rape as an evolutionary by-product hypothesis ====
The 'rape as a by-product' explanation holds that rape behaviour evolved as a by-product of other psychological adaptations in men to obtain many mates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This adaptation not only leads to rape but a number of other behaviours including [[Error management theory|overrating female sexual interest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henningsen|first=David Dryden|last2=Henningsen|first2=Mary Lynn Miller|date=2010-10-01|title=Testing Error Management Theory: Exploring the Commitment Skepticism Bias and the Sexual Overperception Bias|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=618–634|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2010.01391.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; a desire for sexual variety, coercion, and sexual arousal which is not dependent on the consent of mate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1984-08-01|title=Sexual arousal to nonsexual violence and sadomasochistic themes among rapists and non-sex-offenders.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ccp/52/4/651/|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|language=English|volume=52|issue=4|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.52.4.651|issn=1939-2117|pages=651–657 | last1 = Quinsey | first1 = Vernon L. | last2 = Chaplin | first2 = Terry C. | last3 = Upfold | first3 = Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rape specific adaptation evolutionary hypothesis ====
The rape specific adaptation hypothesis suggests that rape is an evolved behaviour because it provides direct benefits to the rapist. In this case, the benefit would be a higher chance of reproductive success through increasing mate number. The hypothesis suggests that rape behaviour is the result of psychological mechanisms designed specifically to influence males to rape, unlike in the by-product hypothesis. This theory suggests that rape by a man which offers no chance of reproductive success, i.e. the rape of any other person who is not a female of reproductive age, is a maladaptive byproduct of this evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Support for the idea that rape provides males with a way to increase their reproductive success comes from a study by Barbaro and Shackelford, who found that men in committed heterosexual relationships who had committed at least one act of violence/coercion towards their partner in the last month had more in-pair copulations per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbaro|first=N|last2=Shackleford|first2=T.K.|year=2016|title=Female-Directed Violence as a Form of Sexual Coercion in Humans (Homo sapiens)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302179509|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=130|issue=4|pages=321–327|via=researchgate.net|doi=10.1037/com0000038|pmid=27732014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some potential specific psychological adaptations that Thornhill and Palmer suggest might be present in men to induce rape include the evolution of a mechanism that helps males evaluate the vulnerability of potential victims, or mechanism that motivates men with a lack of sexual access to females, to rape – the mate deprivation hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The mate deprivation hypothesis alludes to the concept that the threshold for rape is lowered in males that lack alternative reproductive options. This idea is supported by the fact that rape is disproportionately committed by men with a lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Malamuth&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-01-01|title=An evolutionary-based model integrating research on the characteristics of sexually coercive men.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-07769-008|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-01-01|title=The confluence model of sexual aggression: Feminist and evolutionary perspectives.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-98242-011|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a relationship between low socioeconomic status and a rearing environment in which social relationships were not committed, which in turn resulted in a male's reduced ability to form enduring relationships in later life. This subsequently results in less alternative reproductive options. Therefore, while there is indeed a relationship between a lack of alternative reproductive options and rape behaviour, there are likely to be a number of co-morbid factors affecting this correlation, leading Thornhill and Palmer to conclude that the idea of a specific psychological adaptation that motivated men with a lack of sexual access to females is unlikely, and that further research need be conducted.

==== Rejected hypotheses ====
One of [[Randy Thornhill|Thornhill]] and [[Craig T. Palmer|Palmer]]'s rejected hypotheses for why men rape implicates violent [[pornography]]. Subscribers to the [[social science]] theory of rape&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denmark|first=Florence, L.|last2=Friedman|first2=Susan, B.|year=1985|title=Social psychological aspects of rape.|url=|journal=Violence Against Women: A Critique of the Sociobiology of Rape.|volume=|pages=59–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stock|first=Wendy, E.|year=1991|title=Feminist explanations: Male power, hostility and sexual coercion.|url=|journal=Sexual Coercion.|volume=61|pages=73|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; purport that one of the main reasons why the human male learns to rape is via learning imitative behaviour when watching violent pornography. However, this fails to explain why if males are likely to imitate behaviour witnessed in violent pornography they would not also imitate the actions of human males in other videos. Furthermore, no explanation is offered into why this behaviour is inspired in some men and not others. It is also limited in its ability to predict valuable variables surrounding why rape occurs (such as who, when or where). For this reason, Thornhill and Palmer argued that "although the removal of violent pornography may be desirable in its own right, it is very unlikely to solve the problem of rape".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another of their rejected hypotheses is the 'choosing victim' rape-adaptation hypothesis which suggests that there is an evolved victim-preference mechanism to maximise the reproductive benefits of rape. This hypothesis suggests that men would be most likely to rape reproductive-age females. Research shows that the age of US rape victims correlates slightly better with age of peak fertility than age of peak reproductive potential.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill|first=Randy|last2=Wilmsen Thornhill|first2=Nancy|date=1983-01-01|title=Human rape: An evolutionary analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309583900274|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=137–173|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(83)90027-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this explanation does not explain the rape of those with no chance of reproductive success e.g. girls, boys, adult males, and postmenopausal women.

==== Development of sexual coercion ====
Though it is a widely held view that sexually coercive behaviour occurs as a result of sexual selection, Smuts and Smuts (1993) proposed that sexual coercion is best described as a third type of sexual selection, rather than attempting to fit it into either of the other two forms: [[mate choice]] and intrasex competition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While sexual coercion certainly interacts with the other two forms of sexual selection, its conceptual distinction lies under the fact that a sexually coercive male may succeed in the competition for mates using coercion, despite losing in male-male competition for females, and despite not being chosen by females as a mate.

=== Male sexual entitlement ===
Coercive behaviour of men towards women can be argued to be a result of male sexual entitlement. [[Gender stereotypes]] view men and boys as being the more typically aggressive sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Aggression|last=Buss|first=A. H.|publisher=|year=1961|isbn=|location=New York: Wiley|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a man may act aggressively towards women and girls in order to increase his chances of submission from them. This is known as male sexual entitlement – the belief that women and girls owe men sex due to society viewing their sexual gratification as more important. This can result in men being more likely than women to view pressuring a woman or girl into sex as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margolin|first=L|last2=Morgan|first2=P.

Male sexual entitlement, which consequently can predict sexual entitlement due to societal norms, has been found to predict rape-related attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=M.

=== Compromising sexual strategies ===
Sexual strategies are essential to males when pursuing a mate in order to maximize reproductive potential, in order for their genes to be passed on to future generations. However, in order for a male's sexual strategy to succeed with a female, it is the male who must compromise his own sexual strategies, typically because of uncertainty over the paternity of a child, whereas maternity is essentially certain.

Women have higher levels of parental investment because they carry the developing child, and higher confidence in their maternity since they witness giving birth to the child. Hence women have reason to accept greater responsibility for raising their children. By comparison, males have no objective way of being certain that the child they are raising is biologically theirs. Because of this difference, males have to adapt their own sexual strategies to accommodate the strategies of the females around them.&lt;ref&gt;MALE, S. P. C. (1995). Mate preference mechanisms: Consequences for partner choice and intrasexual competition. ''The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other behaviors, this means that men are more likely to favour [[chastity]] in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. Such a strategy is seen in males, and maternity is never doubted by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by women.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromise his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.

== Male homoeroticism ==
[[Homoerotic]] behaviour differs from homosexuality (see below) in that it is purely same-sex sexual behaviour that occurs for pleasure, whereas homosexuality is the sexual orientation or enduring sexual preference for the same-sex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Due to its universality, history and perceived functions it has been theorised that homoerotic behaviour has origins in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cosmides|first1=Tooby|title=The psychological foundations of culture|journal=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture|date=1992|pages=19–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of male homoerotic behaviour ===
[[File:Giulio Romano - Apollo Cyparissus.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Cyparissus]], and [[Apollo]] engaging in the custom of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece]] (1596) - Nationalmuseum, Stockholm by [[Giulio Romano]].]]
There is evidence of the long-standing existence of homoeroticism, dating back to early human history. From cave paintings of men engaging in sexual acts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=A|title=Celtic and northern art|journal=Primitive Erotic Art|date=1973|pages=77–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; to modern history, homoerotic behaviour is still prevalent today.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
From an evolutionary perspective homoeroticism is seen as counter-productive as it doesn't directly contribute to successfully producing offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallup|first1=J|title=Homosexuaty as a By-Product of Selection for Optimal Heterosexual Strategies|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|date=1983|volume=26.2|issue=2|pages=315–322|doi=10.1353/pbm.1983.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, male-male sexual behaviour has been argued to have served an [[Adaptive behavior (ecology)|adaptive function]] and an indirect reproductive advantage for males. Evidence suggests that male-male sexual relations in early human periods often occurred between younger adolescent boys and older males. Sexual acts have been viewed as a psychological factor in societies used for bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muscarella|first1=Frank|title=The evolution of homoerotic behaviour in humans|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=40|date=2000|issue=40.1|pages=51–77|doi=10.1300/j082v40n01_03|pmid=11195666}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same-sex relations between young adolescent boys and older men brought many benefits to the younger males, such as access to food, protection from aggression and overall helping them attain personal survival and an increased social standing. These direct effects on survival also led to indirect effects of [[reproductive success]]. The advantages the young males would obtain from their sexual relations with older men made them a more desired mating choice amongst females. The age and status difference between the men involved, suggests that a dominance-submission dynamic was an important factor in these relations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Alliance hypothesis===
The [[Alliance theory]] perspective of male-male sexual behaviour in early humans states that this behaviour was a feature that developed to reduce aggression between different males and to enforce alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muscarella|first1=Frank|title=The evolution of male-male sexual behaviour in humans: The alliance theory|journal=Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality|date=2007|volume=18.4|issue=4|pages=275–311|doi=10.1300/j056v18n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that young adult males and adolescents were segregated from society and living on the outskirts of communities due to their perceived sexual threat by the older men. Therefore, same-sex behaviour allowed younger men to have reinforced alliances with other older males, which later gained them access to resources and females which were both scarce at the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Similarly, Kirkpatrick states male-male sexual behaviour has occurred in part because of the [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocal-altruism hypothesis]]. The older male receives [[sexual gratification]] from the relationship whilst the younger male has to bear the cost of engaging in non-reproductve sex. However, the younger male is able to later receive the social benefits discussed, through this same-sex alliance. This relationship can be viewed as a resource exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=C|title=The evolution of human homosexual behaviour|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2000|volume=41.3|issue=3|pages=385–413|doi=10.1086/300145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the evolutionary perspective, much of modern history demonstrates higher and lower status roles between two men involved in sexual relations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; There is evidence of males seducing each other for social gain as well as sexual pleasure. Examples of this in modern history include Roman Emperors such as [[Augustus|Augustus Caesar]], who supposedly acquired the throne in part due to their sexual relations with their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boswell|first1=John|title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ancient Greek custom of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederasty]] provides additional support for the evolutionary account. It was very common for adult males and adolescent males in ancient Greece to engage in sexual relations. Similarly to relationships found in early humans who displayed homoeroticism, the relationship dynamic between males involved in pederasty in the ancient Greek period was unequal. These young males also received benefits such as increased social networks and educational development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ungaretti|first1=John|title=Pederasty, heroism and the family in classical Greece|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=1978|volume=3|issue=3|pages=291–300|doi=10.1300/j082v03n03_11|pmid=351049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functions of homoerotic behaviour ===
[[File:Pederastic_courtship_Louvre_CA3096.jpg|thumb|Pederastic courtship. [[Paris]], [[Musée du Louvre, Paris|Musée du Louvre]].]]
[[Homosexuality|Homoerotic behaviour]] has been thought to be maintained by indirect selection, since it does not encourage [[reproduction]]. The kin-selection hypothesis, which argued that homosexuals contribute to their nephews' and nieces' survival, and the female fertility hypothesis, were both findings which support the idea that homoerotic behaviour is an evolutionary by-product that serves no beneficial function by itself (for discussion see the section on homosexuality, below).

Relatively newer studies suggest that similar to how heterosexual bonds provide non-conceptive benefits, including the maintenance of long-term bonds, homoerotic behaviour aid in same-sex alliances that help in resource competition or defense.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick 385–413"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=R. C.|date=2000-01-01|title=The Evolution of Human Homosexual Behavior|jstor=10.1086/300145|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=385–413|doi=10.1086/300145|pmid=10768881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions that are homosexual in nature could help to foster and reinforce supportive relationships, one example of which would be the [[Zande people|Azande]] society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E. E.|date=1970-12-01|title=Sexual Inversion among the Azande|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1428–1434|doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.6.02a00170|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which homosexual relationships were very common, and the [[Sambia people|Sambia]], who engage in homoerotic behaviour between the initiates in their militia, and their behavior buttress bonds that were important in survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G1444C8A8-kC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;q=Herdt%201984|title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia|last=Herdt|first=Gilbert H.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520080966|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various societies, many individuals exhibit homoerotic behaviour during certain stages of their life, notably during [[adolescence]], and generally before their heterosexual marriage, possibly because that same-sex alliances are more important in one's early life than later, when the concern for [[sexual reproduction]] comes into play, and individuals who engage in homoerotic acts obtain benefits applicable to their reproductive lives. Before that period of their life, same-sex alliances are important in aiding survival, and among the [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] of [[Belize]], significantly more children survive past six months for men with same-sex alliance due to the increase in productivity of agricultural labour.

Same-sex alliances do not need to be sexual in nature, although when competition for partners is especially severe the sexualisation of same-sex alliances occurs more often.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick 385–413"/&gt; Displays of commitment between partners are adaptive because of the cost in terms of efforts invested in maintaining the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahavi|first=Amotz|date=1975-09-01|title=Mate selection—A selection for a handicap|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519375901113|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex could be argued as a type of currency in long-term relationships, and signify to an individual's partner and to others a prominent level of connection and commitment. Homosexual/homoerotic behaviour would be therefore a significant representation of one's loyalty and affiliation in a same-sex alliance. Ultimately, homoerotic behaviour is not selectively disadvantaged, as homoerotic behaviour does not result in a net decrease to an individual's [[reproductive success]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinrich|first=James D|date=1987-01-01|title=A new sociobiological theory of homosexuality applicable to societies with universal marriage|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309587900562|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=37–47|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(87)90056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the attraction to other individuals of same sex and the behaviour as result of that [[Sexual attraction|attraction]] is not contrary or alternative to the attraction to people of the other sex.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick 385–413"/&gt;

Subsequent research in the role of homoerotic behaviour further supports the "affiliation hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Samuel|date=2009-06-05|title=Did Warfare Among Ancestral Hunter-Gatherers Affect the Evolution of Human Social Behaviors?|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5932/1293|journal=Science|language=en|volume=324|issue=5932|pages=1293–1298|doi=10.1126/science.1168112|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19498163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Kim|last2=Hurtado|first2=A.

This effect is most pronounced in men with high [[progesterone]], a [[hormone]] that is associated with affiliative motivation in humans. In spite of the opportunity costs homoerotic behaviour and motivation were thought to incur, the results provide data constituting evidence that homoerotic motivation, and subsequently homoerotic behaviour, holds the adaptive function of encouraging alliance formation and bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischman|first=Diana S.|last2=Fessler|first2=Daniel M.

The Western "[[homosexual]]" category has been related{{By whom|date=January 2016}} to the non-Western "[[third gender]]" category, being cast as a redefinition and expansion of the latter category to include all biological males who acknowledge having [[same-sex attraction]]s (instead of only [[effeminate]] males). This extension of "third gender" is due to various factors that were unique to the Western world, including the widespread influence of [[Christianity]] and the resultant encouragement of opposite-sex relationships.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Before the concept of [[sexual orientation]] was developed in the modern West, only effeminate males who sought to be [[anal sex|anally penetrated]] by men ([[oral sex]] was far less common than today){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} were seen as a belonging to a different gender category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.jccc.net/scorbett01/ch8/zuni_berdache.htm Zuni Berdache] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808063222/http://staff.jccc.net/scorbett01/ch8/zuni_berdache.htm |date=8 August 2010 }} Quotes: History of hermaphrodites&lt;/ref&gt; The Western equivalent of the third-genders (and not all men with same-sex attractions) were the ones who started and propagated the Western concept of a [[homosexual]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rictornorton.co.uk/social15.htm A false birth]: A critique of [[social constructionism]] and postmodern queer theory, by Rictor Norton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=3613563 Sex and the Gender Revolution, Volume 1 Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London] Quotes: The University of Chicago Press, by Randolph Trumbach&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/full/93/6/894 Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Alfred C.

It is argued that 'Whitman himself stubbornly resisted the notion of a distinctive homosexual sensibility' (D'Emilio 1993)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Western societies show hostility towards the concept of [[homosexuality]], which they view as a pernicious Western practice and a legacy of [[colonialism]] and (Western) [[sexual tourism]]. However, and strangely to Western eyes, such societies do accept both [[men who have sex with men]] and third-genders who have sex with men as an unremarkable part of society, so long as they're not called "homosexuals".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Origins of the heterosexual–homosexual classification===
{{see also|heterosexual–homosexual continuum}}

In the 1860s, German [[third-gender]] [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] coined a new term for third-genders that he called "urnings", which was supposed to mean "men who like men". These "urnings" were "females inside male bodies", who were emotionally or sexually attracted to men. Ulrichs and most self-declared members of the third sex thought that masculine men can never have sexual desires for other men. Hence, to be attracted to men, a male necessarily had to be feminine-gendered – had to have a female inside him. This was supported by Ulrichs' own experience, as well as by the fact that men only had sex with men secretively, due to the cultural climate. Ulrichs termed ordinary men (as opposed to third-genders) as "diones", meaning "men who like women."

Later, [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[third-gender]] and [[human rights]] activist [[Karl Maria Kertbeny]] coined the terms "[[homosexuality|homosexual]]" and "[[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]". For most of this period, these terms were popular only amongst the third-gender and scientific communities, the latter of which was developing the concept of [[Homosexuality and psychology|homosexuality as a mental disorder]].

Thus was born the idea of "men who like men" being different from "men who like women", and of differentiating male sexuality between "heterosexuality" and "homosexuality". The basis for the division, however, remained gender orientation ([[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]). Men who were now decidedly "heterosexual", however, rarely related to these terms; they saw themselves as neither [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Even in 2010, "straight" men in the West, quite like men in the East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://contexts.org/sexuality/2010/02/02/fox-news-struggles-with-sexual-identities-of-afghan-men/ Sexuality and Society Fox News Struggles with Sexual Identities of Afghan Men] by Shari L. Dworkin; Sexuality and Society; Quote from the report: "found that Pashtun men commonly have sex with other men, admire other men physically, have sexual relationships with boys and shun women both socially and sexually &amp;ndash; yet they completely reject the label of 'homosexual'."&lt;/ref&gt; seldom relate strongly to [[sexual identity|sexual identities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/j428602067202837/Accounts of sexual identity formation in heterosexual students], SpringerLink; by Michele J. Eliason1, College of Nursing, The University of Iowa; Quote from the abstract: Students could be categorized into all four of Marcia's identity statuses. Additionally, six common themes were noted in their essays: had never thought about sexual identity; society made me heterosexual; gender determines sexual identity; issues of choice versus innateness of sexuality; no alternative to heterosexuality; and the influence of religion.&lt;/ref&gt; These identities, however, remain a strong focus within the [[LGBT community]].

'''Hypersexual disorder''' is a pattern of behavior involving intense preoccupation with [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], urges and activities, leading to adverse consequences and clinically significant [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] or impairment in social, occupational or other important functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafka|first=Martin P.|date=2010-04-01|title=Hypersexual Disorder: A Proposed Diagnosis for DSM-V|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=377–400|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7|issn=0004-0002}} {{url|http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.433.1948&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed in 2010 for inclusion in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). 

==Criteria==
People with hypersexual disorder experience multiple, unsuccessful attempts to control or diminish the amount of time spent engaging in sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors in response to [[Dysphoria|dysphoric mood states]] or [[Psychological stress|stressful]] life events. 

For a valid diagnosis of hypersexual disorder to be established, symptoms must persist for a period of at least 6 months and occur independently of a  use [[mania]] or a medical condition.&lt;ref name=APApage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=415|title=American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Development Page for Hypersexual Disorder|website=Dsm5.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hypersexual disorder was recommended for inclusion in the [[DSM-5]] (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) by the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Workgroup (Emerging Measures and Models, Conditions for Further Study). It was ultimately not approved.&lt;ref name=dsm5sexdysfunc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/SexualDysfunctions.aspx|title=DSM-5 Development Page for Sexual Dysfunctions.|website=Dsm5.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''hypersexual disorder'' was reportedly chosen because it did not imply any specific theory for the causes of [[hypersexuality]], which remain unknown.&lt;ref name=Kafka2010&gt;Kafka, M. P. (2010). Hypersexual Disorder: A proposed diagnosis for DSM-V. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 377–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  A proposal to add [[sexual addiction]] to the DSM system had been previously rejected by the APA, as not enough evidence suggested to them that the condition is analogous to substance addictions, as that name would imply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-10-dsm10_ST_N.htm|title=Psychiatry's bible: Autism, binge-eating updates proposed for 'DSM' - USATODAY.com|website=Usatoday.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055212/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2010/02/10/new-diagnostic-guidelines-for-mental-illnesses-proposed|title=New Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed|website=Health.usnews.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rory Reid, a research psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of California Los Angeles]] (UCLA), led a team of researchers to investigate the proposed criteria for Hypersexual Disorder. Their findings were published in the ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' where they concluded that the given criteria is valid and the disorder could be reliably diagnosed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02936.x/abstract|title=Report of Findings in a DSM-5 Field Trial for Hypersexual Disorder|first1=Rory C.|last1=Reid|first2=Bruce N.|last2=Carpenter|first3=Joshua N.|last3=Hook|first4=Sheila|last4=Garos|first5=Jill C.|last5=Manning|first6=Randy|last6=Gilliland|first7=Erin B.|last7=Cooper|first8=Heather|last8=McKittrick|first9=Margarit|last9=Davtian|first10=Timothy|last10=Fong|date=1 November 2012|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2868–2877|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02936.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[DSM-IV-TR]], published in 2000, includes an entry called "Sexual Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified" (Sexual Disorder NOS), for disorders that are clinically significant but do not have code. The DSM-IV-TR notes that Sexual Disorder NOS would apply to, among other conditions, "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used".&lt;ref name=APA2000&gt;American Psychiatric Association.

'''Hypersexuality is''' a [[clinical diagnosis]] used by [[mental health]]care professionals for extremely frequent or suddenly increased [[libido]]. '''Nymphomania''' and '''satyriasis''' were terms previously used for the condition, in women and men respectively.

Hypersexuality may be a primary condition, or the symptom of another medical disease or condition, for example [[Klüver-Bucy syndrome]] or [[bipolar disorder]]. Hypersexuality may also present as a side effect of medication such as drugs used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]], or through the administering of hormones such as [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and [[estrogen]] during [[hormone therapy]].
Clinicians have yet to reach a consensus over how best to describe hypersexuality as a primary condition,&lt;ref&gt;Stein, D. J. (2008). Classifying hypersexual disorders: Compulsive, impulsive, and addictive models. ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 31,'' 587–592.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, J., &amp; Vukadinovic, Z.

Hypersexual behaviours are viewed variously by clinicians and therapists as a type of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) or "OCD-spectrum disorder", an addiction,&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (1985).

==Terminology==
The ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' defines ''hypersexual'' as "exhibiting unusual or excessive concern with or indulgence in sexual activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypersexual|title=Hypersexual – Definition of hypersexual by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexologists]] have been using the term ''hypersexuality'' since the late 1800s, when [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]] described several cases of extreme sexual behaviours in his seminal 1886 book, ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]].''&lt;ref&gt;Krafft-Ebing, R. von (1886/1965).

''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 377–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author used the term "hypersexuality" to describe conditions that would now be termed [[premature ejaculation]]. Terms to describe males with the condition include ''donjuanist'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sifuentes-Jáuregui|first1=B|title=Transvestism, Masculinity, and Latin American Literature: Genders Share Flesh|date=2002|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''satyromaniac'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|date=2015|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;''satyriac''&lt;ref&gt;Eghigian, Greg.

==Causes==
There is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany [[dementia]]. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Persons suffering from injuries to this part of the brain are at increased risk for aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and socially inappropriate sexual behavior such as hypersexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Karen M.

In research involving use of [[antiandrogen]]s to reduce undesirable sexual behaviour such as hypersexuality, testosterone has been found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for sexual drive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/09585189508409891|title = Hypersexuality revisited| journal=The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry| volume=6| issue=2| pages=255–258|year = 1995|last1 = Catalan|first1 = Jose| last2=Singh| first2=Ashok}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other proposed factors include a lack of physical closeness, and forgetfulness of the recent past.&lt;ref name=Robinson2003 /&gt;

==As a symptom==
Hypersexuality is known to present itself as a symptom in connection to a number of mental and neurological disorders. Some people with [[borderline personality disorder]] (sometimes referred to as BPD) can be markedly impulsive, seductive, and extremely sexual. [[Sexual promiscuity]], [[sexual obsessions]], and hypersexuality are very common symptoms for both men and women with BPD. On occasion for some there can be extreme forms of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic drives and desires]].  "Borderline" patients, due in the opinion of some to the use of [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], experience love and [[sexuality]] in unstable ways.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01405-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freud_and_Beyond.html?id=4ODr9mxI53oC|authorlink=Stephen A. Mitchell (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with [[bipolar disorder]] may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood. As defined in the DSM-IV-TR, hypersexuality can be a symptom of [[hypomania]] or [[mania]] in [[bipolar disorder]] or [[schizoaffective disorder]].

Symptoms of hypersexuality are also similar to those of sexual addiction in that they embody similar traits. These symptoms include the inability to be intimate ([[intimacy anorexia]]), depression and bipolar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38983487|title=The Final Freedom: Pioneering Sexual Addiction Recovery|last=Douglas.|first=Weiss,|date=1998|publisher=Discovery Press|year=|isbn=1881292371|location=Fort Worth, Tex.|pages=31–34|oclc=38983487}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting hypersexuality may have an impact in the person's social and occupational domains if the underlying symptoms have a large enough systemic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38983487|title=The Final Freedom: Pioneering Sexual Addiction Recovery|last=Douglas.|first=Weiss,|date=1998|publisher=Discovery Press|year=|isbn=1881292371|location=Fort Worth, Tex.|pages=87–88, 92–93|oclc=38983487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Addiction: 6 Types and Treatment|last=Weiss|first=Douglas|publisher=Discovery Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-881292-36-4|location=Forth Worth, TX|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a disorder==
{{Main|Sexual addiction|Hypersexual disorder}}
{{As of|2010}}, a proposal to add ''[[Sexual addiction|Sexual Addiction]]'' to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) system has failed to get support of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-10-dsm10_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Rita | last=Rubin | title=Psychiatry's bible: Autism, binge-eating updates proposed for 'DSM' | date=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=Black Friday deals for Target, H&amp;M, Forever21, Old Navy, Radio Shack and more |date=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055212/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2010/02/10/new-diagnostic-guidelines-for-mental-illnesses-proposed |title=New Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed|publisher=Health.usnews.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM does include an entry called Sexual Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Sexual Disorder NOS) to apply to, among other conditions, "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used".&lt;ref name=APA2000&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), includes two relevant entries. One is "Excessive Sexual Drive" (coded F52.7),&lt;ref name="ICD-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thcc.or.th/ICD-10TM/gf50.htm |title=2012 ICD-10 Diagnosis Code F52.7 : Excessive sexual drive |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is divided into satyriasis for males and nymphomania for females.  The other is "Excessive Masturbation" or "Onanism (excessive)" (coded F98.8).&lt;ref name="icd10data_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F90-F98/F98-/F98.8 |title=2012 ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code F98.8 : Other specified behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence |publisher=Icd10data.com |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned whether it makes sense to discuss hypersexuality at all, arguing that labeling sexual urges "extreme" merely stigmatizes people who do not conform to the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of their culture or peer group.&lt;ref name=Levine1988&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levine |first=M.

The [[ICD-11]] has created a new condition classification, '''compulsive sexual behavior''', to cover " a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/10/health/compulsive-sexual-behavior-mental-health-condition/index.html|title=WHO classifies compulsive sexual behavior as mental health condition|last=CNN|first=Jen Christensen,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1630268048|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Treatment==
Hypersexuality may negatively impact an individual. The concept of hypersexuality as an addiction was started in the 1970s by former members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] who felt they experienced a similar lack of control and compulsivity with sexual behaviors as with alcohol.&lt;ref name=Levine1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some hypersexuals may treat their condition with the usage of medication (such as [[Cyproterone acetate]]) or any foods considered to be [[anaphrodisiac]]s.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} Other hypersexuals may choose a route of consultation, such as psychotherapy, self-help groups or counselling.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Mark D., and Manpreet K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68636">'''Infections associated with diseases''' are those that are associated with possible [[Infection|infectious]] [[Etiology (medicine)|etiologies]], that meet the requirements of [[Koch's postulates]]. Other methods of causation are described by the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] and [[Evidence-based medicine]]. [[Koch's postulate]]s have been altered by some [[epidemiologist]]s based upon [[DNA sequencing|sequence-based detection]] of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences in [[tissue sample]]s. Using this method, absolute statements are not always possible regarding [[Causality|
causation]]. Since this is true, higher amounts of distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences would be in those exhibiting disease compared to controls since inoculating those without the pathogen is [[unethical]]. In addition, the DNA load should drop or become lower with the resolution of the [[disease]]. The distinctive pathogenic nucleic acid sequences load should also increase upon recurrence.

Other conditions are met to establish cause or association including studies in [[disease transmission]].  This means that there should be a high disease occurrence in those carrying an [[pathogen]], evidence of a [[serology|serological]]response to the pathogen, and the success of [[vaccination]] prevention. Direct [[microscopy|visualization]] of the pathogen, the identification of different [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s, [[imunology|immunological responses]] in the [[Host (biology)|host]], how the infection is spread and, the combination of these should all be taken into account to determine the [[probability]] that an infectious agent is the cause of the disease. A conclusive determination of a causal role of an infectious agent for in a particular disease using Koch's postulates is desired yet this might not be possible.&lt;ref name="Tijsse-KlasenKoopmans2014" /&gt;

The leading cause of death worldwide is [[cardiovascular disease]], but infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in [[infant]]s and children.&lt;ref name="LeeNguyen2015"/&gt;

==Other causes==
Other causes or associations of disease are: a [[uncompromised|compromised immune system]], environmental toxins, [[radiation exposure]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[lifestyle choices]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and [[genetics]]. Diseases may also be multifactorial, requiring multiple factors to induce disease. For example: in a murine model, Crohn's disease can be precipitated by a [[norovirus]], but only when both a specific gene variant is present and a certain [[toxin]] has damaged the [[gastrointestinal system|gut]].&lt;ref name="PMID_20602997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadwell|first1=Ken|last2=Patel|first2=Khushbu K.|last3=Maloney|first3=Nicole S.|last4=Liu|first4=Ta-Chiang|last5=Ng|first5=Aylwin C.Y.|last6=Storer|first6=Chad E.|last7=Head|first7=Richard D.|last8=Xavier|first8=Ramnik|last9=Stappenbeck|first9=Thaddeus S.|display-authors=8|date=June 2010|title=Virus-Plus-Susceptibility Gene Interaction Determines Crohn's Disease Gene ''Atg16L1'' Phenotypes in Intestine|journal=Cell|volume=141|issue=7|pages=1135–45|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.05.009|pmc=2908380|pmid=20602997|last10=Virgin|first10=Herbert W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of first examples of systematic study of disease causation was [[Avicenna]], in the tenth century. The history of infection and disease were observed in the 1800s and related to the one of the tick-borne diseases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The cause of [[viral encephalitis]] was discovered in Russia based upon epidemiological clustering of cases. The virus causing this illness was isolated in 1937. The rash typical of Lyme borreliosis was identified the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Tijsse-KlasenKoopmans2014"/&gt; Historically, some chronic diseases were linked or associated with infectious [[pathogens]].&lt;ref name="Knobler2004PagesXItoXII"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83716/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|pages=xi–xii|chapter=PREFACE|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knobler2004Page2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83701/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|page=2|chapter=SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knobler2004Pages13to14"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83680/|title=The Infectious Etiology of Chronic Diseases: Defining the Relationship, Enhancing the Research, and Mitigating the Effects: Workshop Summary|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Microbial Threats|date=1 July 2004|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-08994-4|editor1-last=Knobler|editor1-first=Stacey L|pages=13–14|chapter=OVERVIEW|editor2-last=O'Connor|editor2-first=Siobhán|editor3-last=Lemon|editor3-first=Stanley M|editor4-last=Najafi|editor4-first=Marjan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--For an infectious pathogenic microbe that has been noted to frequently accompany a disease, there are several logical possibilities that can explain this observed association: [[File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|275px|right|An [[epithelium|epithelial cell]] infected with [[Chlamydia pneumoniae]] bacteria.]]

:* The pathogen is an "innocent bystander" that plays no causal role in the etiology of the disease, but for some reason is more prevalent in patients with the disease (perhaps because the disease compromises the immune response, for example).
:* The pathogen predisposes to disease development (increases the risk of getting the disease), but the pathogen does not cause the disease (for example, genital herpes increases the risk of acquiring HIV).
:* The pathogen is a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of the disease: in other words, the pathogen can cause the disease, but does so only in combination with one or more other causal factors (such as host genetic factors, or toxin exposure).
:* The pathogen is a direct and singular cause of the disease, but this causality has yet to be proven.

Determining whether a pathogen plays a causal role in a chronic disease is often difficult for the following reasons:

:* The time between contracting an infectious pathogen and the appearance of the first disease symptoms can be lengthy, sometimes decades.
:* An infectious pathogen may not cause disease in every person.
:* An infection may be asymptomatic in its acute phase (when first contracted), and so go unnoticed; symptoms may only appear much later — in the form of a chronic disease.
:* Sometimes, only specific strains of a pathogen are linked to a disease; other strains of the same microbe may be harmless.
:* A pathogen may precipitate the disease only in combination with one or more other causal factors.
:* There may be more than one pathogen that can precipitate a given disease.
:* A given pathogen may not always cause the same disease — infection with it may lead to one of several different diseases.
:* There may be pathogens that are not readily detectable that play a causal role in a disease.
:* For obvious ethical reasons, you cannot inoculate infectious pathogens into humans to see if these do cause the disease or not.
:* A pathogenic microbe may cause disease by relatively easy to track ''direct'' means, such as by infecting and destroying cells; or may cause disease via more complex and convoluted ''indirect'' means, such as through the damage created by inflammatory [[cytokines]] or [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] processes that are induced by the microbial infection (for example, tuberculosis infection induces an inflammatory cytokine that then itself causes severe tissue damage).&lt;ref name="PMID_19275693" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID_20015961" /&gt;
:* A pathogenic microbe may not necessarily be present in the diseased tissues or organs (bacterial toxins for example can travel and damage tissues at sites distant from the infection site; and inflammatory or autoimmune processes precipitated by infectious pathogens can also act at tissue sites far removed from the infection).--&gt;

In [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[abnormal psychology]], '''institutionalization''' or '''institutional syndrome''' refers to deficits or disabilities in social and life skills, which develop after a person has spent a long period living in [[mental hospital]]s, [[prison]]s, or other remote institutions. In other words, individuals in institutions may be deprived (whether unintentionally or not) of independence and of responsibility, to the point that once they return to "outside life" they are often unable to manage many of its demands;&lt;ref name=Williams83-5&gt;{{Harvtxt|Williams|1994|pp=83–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solving&gt;Solving Mental Health Problems (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been argued that institutionalized individuals become psychologically more prone to mental health problems.&lt;ref name=LeiteSchmid&gt;{{Harvtxt|Leite|Schmid|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[:wikt:institutionalization#2|institutionalization]]'' can also be used to describe the process of committing an individual to a mental hospital or prison or to institutional syndrome; thus the phrase "X is institutionalized" may mean either that X has been placed in an institution, or that X is suffering the psychological effects of having been in an institution for an extended period of time.

==Background==
{{further|Psychiatric hospital}}
In Europe and North America, the trend of putting the mentally ill into mental hospitals began as early as the 17th century,&lt;ref name=MentalHelp&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=8813&amp;cn=7 | title=Institutionalization and Deinstitutionalization with Schizophrenia | first=Rashmi | last=Nemade | first2=Mark | last2=Dombeck | date=14 February 2006 | accessdate=11 June 2009 | work=MentalHealth.net}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hospitals often focused more on "restraining" or controlling inmates than on curing them,&lt;ref name=Grob104&gt;{{Harvnb|Grob|1994|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; although hospital conditions improved somewhat with movements for human treatment, such as [[moral management]]. By the mid-20th century, overcrowding in institutions,&lt;ref name=Grob127/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{Citation | title=20th Century History of the Treatment of Mental Illness: A Review | last=Palmer | first=Ann | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040710022826/http://www.mentalhealthworld.org/29ap.html | archivedate=10 July 2004 | url=http://www.mentalhealthworld.org/29ap.html | accessdate=11 June 2009}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the failure of institutional treatment to cure most mental illnesses,&lt;ref name=Grob127&gt;{{Harvnb|Grob|1994|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the advent of drugs such as [[Thorazine]]&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt; prompted many hospitals to begin discharging patients in large numbers, in the beginning of the [[deinstitutionalization]] movement (the process of gradually moving people from [[inpatient care]] in mental hospitals, to [[outpatient care]]).

Deinstitutionalization did not always result in better treatment, however, and in many ways it helped reveal some of the shortcomings of institutional care, as discharged patients were often unable to take care of themselves, and many ended up homeless or in jail.&lt;ref name=Shorter280&gt;{{Harvnb|Shorter|1997|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, many of these patients had become "institutionalized" and were unable to adjust to independent living. One of the first studies to address the issue of institutionalization directly was Russell Barton's 1959 book ''Institutional Neurosis,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutional Neurosis|last=Barton|first=Russell|publisher=Bristol: John Wright and Sons|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that many symptoms of mental illness (specifically, [[psychosis]]) were not physical brain defects as once thought, but were consequences of institutions' "stripping" (a term probably first used in this context by [[Erving Goffman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asylums: essays on the social situation of mental patients and other inmates.|last=Goffman|first=Erving|publisher=New York: Anchor Books|year=1961|isbn=|location=|pages=48, 119|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) away the "psychological crutches" of their patients.

Since the middle of the 20th century, the problem of institutionalization has been one of the motivating factors for the increasing popularity of deinstitutionalization and the growth of [[community mental health service]]s,&lt;ref name=Solving/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams151&gt;{{Harvtxt|Williams|1994|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; since some mental healthcare providers believe that institutional care may create as many problems as it solves.

Romanian children who suffered from severe neglect at a young age were adopted by families. Research reveals that the post-institutional syndrome occurring in these children gave rise to symptoms of autistic behavior. Studies done on eight Romanian adoptees living in the Netherlands revealed that about one third of the children exhibited behavioral and communication problems resembling that of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoksbergen|first=Rene |author2=J. Laak |author3=K. Rijk |author4=[[Cor van Dijkum|C.V Dijkum]] |author5=F. Stoutjesdijk |title=Post-Institutional Autistic Syndrome in Romanian Adoptees|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=October 2005|volume=35|pmid=16167089|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0005-x|pages=615–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues for discharged patients==
Individuals who suffer from institutional syndrome can face several kinds of difficulties upon returning to the community. The lack of independence and responsibility for patients within institutions, along with the 'depressing'&lt;ref name=Grob127/&gt; and 'dehumanizing'&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;  environment, can make it difficult for patients to live and work independently. Furthermore, the experience of being in an institution may often have exacerbated individuals' illness: proponents of [[Labeling theory#The "mentally ill"|labeling theory]] claim that individuals who are socially "labeled" as mentally ill suffer stigmatization and alienation that lead to psychological damage and a lessening of self-esteem, and thus that being placed in a mental health institution can actually cause individuals to become more mentally ill.&lt;ref name=WrightGronfein&gt;{{Citation | title=Deinstitutionalization, social rejection, and the self-esteem of former mental patients | journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume=41 | issue=1 | year=2000 | last=Wright | first=Eric R | last2=Gronfein | first2=William P | last3=Owens | first3=Timothy J | pages=68–90 | jstor=2676361 | doi=10.2307/2676361 | publisher=American Sociological Association | pmid=10750323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Linketal&gt;{{Citation | title=A Modified Labeling Theory Approach to Mental Disorders: An Empirical Assessment | journal=American Sociological Review | volume=54 | issue=3 | year=1989 | pages=400–423 | first=Bruce G | last=Link | first2=Francis T | last2=Cullen | first3=Elmer | last3=Struening | first4=Patrick E | last4=Shrout | first5=Bruce P | last5=Dohrenwend | jstor=2095613 | doi=10.2307/2095613 | publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38077">This is a '''list of nutrition guides'''. A nutrition guide is a [[reference]] that provides [[nutrition]] advice for general [[health]], typically by dividing foods into [[food group]]s and recommending [[serving size|servings]] of each group. Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form, and are commonly published by [[government agency|government agencies]], [[health association]]s and [[university]] health [[academic department|departments]].

Most countries also have [[nutrition facts label]]s which are not listed here; many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients.

==Historical guides==

===Ancient Greece===
The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] of [[Ancient Greece]] contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides. It recommends a [[season]]al [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. For [[winter]], it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish, while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to, if anything, strong wine. It then recommends a lighter [[summer]] diet of soft [[barley]] cake, vegetables, boiled meat, and large quantities of diluted wine. Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hippocratic Writings|year=1983|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044451-3|pages=272–273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKjpaVEpP9oC|author=Various|editor1=G. E. R. Lloyd |editor2=J. Chadwick |editor3=W. N. Mann |accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=A Regimen for Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[China|Chinese]] [[physician]] [[Sun Simiao]] is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. In his book, ''Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:備|備]][[wikt:急|急]][[wikt:千|千]][[wikt:金|金]][[wikt:要|要]][[wikt:方|方]]|p=Beiji qianjin yaofang}}), the chapter "Dietary Treatment" ({{zh|c=[[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:治|治]]|p=Shiji}}) contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits, vegetables, grains and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsu|first=Elisabeth|title=Innovation in Chinese Medicine|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80068-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbYYstLfSyUC|accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=Dietetics in Tang China and the first extant works of ''materia diatetica''|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First food pyramid===
Amid high food prices in 1972, [[Sweden]]'s [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] developed the idea of "basic foods" that were both cheap and [[nutritious]], and "supplemental foods" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. [[Kooperativa Förbundet|KF]], a [[cooperative federation|consumer co-op]] that worked with the Board, sought to illustrate these food groups. KF developed a [[food guide pyramid|food pyramid]] because it could depict basic foods as its base, and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine, ''[[:sv:Vi (tidning)|Vi]]''. At the base were bread, cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese and margarine; above it was a large section of supplemental [[vegetables]] and [[fruit]]; and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's "dietary circle," which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, plus [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |title=Ett provkok blev provkök |language=Swedish |date=2008-10-03 |work=KF |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031502/http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |title=KF Provkök lanserar idén om basmat |language=Swedish |year=1973 |work=Coop |publisher=KF |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929023533/http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=matpyramid|url=http://www.ne.se/matpyramid|work=Nationalencyklopedin|accessdate=7 June 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both the Swedish government and KF have moved to the [[#Sweden|Plate Model]].&lt;ref name=LVPlate&gt;{{cite web|title=Tallriksmodellen|url=http://www.slv.se/sv/grupp1/Mat-och-naring/Matcirkeln-och-tallriksmoddellen/Tallriksmodellen/|work=Livsmedelsverket|accessdate=9 June 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612103654/http://www.slv.se/sv/grupp1/Mat-och-naring/Matcirkeln-och-tallriksmoddellen/Tallriksmodellen/|archivedate=12 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunda Bröd &amp; Smörgåsar|url=http://www.mersmak.kf.se/upload/KF%20Konsument/sunda-brod.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005175837/http://www.mersmak.kf.se/upload/KF%20Konsument/sunda-brod.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 October 2006|work=KF|accessdate=9 June 2011|language=Swedish|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government guides==

===Australia===
The [[Australia]]n [[Department of Health and Ageing]] publishes '''''The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating''''', which features a wheel divided into five sections: approximately 40 percent bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles; 30 percent vegetables and legumes; 10 percent fruit; 10 percent milk, yogurt and cheese; and 10 percent lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes. Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating – Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|archivedate=19 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender, life stage and activity level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating: Background information for consumers|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/E384CFA588B74377CA256F190004059B/$File/fd-cons.pdf|work=Australian Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=6 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
The [[Austria]]n Federal Ministry of Health uses '''The Austrian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide}}), which is divided into 25 blocks, each block representing a daily serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six servings of non-alcoholic beverages (preferably low-energy drinks like water, tea, unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice); three servings of vegetables and legumes; two of fruit; four of cereals, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes (preferably whole grains); three of milk and dairy (two "white," like milk, yogurt or cream cheese, and one of yellow cheese); one of fats and oil (preferably olive or canola oil); three of meat, fish, sausage and eggs (preferably fish or lean meat); and three of fatty, sweet and salty foods (though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.bmg.gv.at/home/Schwerpunkte/Ernaehrung/Empfehlungen/DIE_OeSTERREICHISCHE_ERNAeHRUNGSPYRAMIDE|work=Bundesministerium für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Voedingsdriehoek is a (mostly in Flanders) widely used tool for dietitians, health educators, schools, etc. to explain a balanced diet.
The triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers. The bottom layer is the largest in area, so the most important, the top is narrow and there represents little food, although it is an essential ingredient. The layers are (from top to bottom):
-	Oil / fats
-	Protein: meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, meat substitutes
-	Fruits and vegetables
-	Starch or carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.)
-	Drinks
In 2005 a (rather symbolically) layer was added at the bottom: sports and exercise. This is not a food, but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. The information services use the "active" food pyramid.

===Brazil===
[[Brazil]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Ministry of Health]] publishes the '''''Food Guide''''' ({{lang-pt|Guia Alimentar}}), which features a map of Brazil depicting each of [[Regions of Brazil|Brazil's five regions]] as puzzle pieces representing a food group. However, Brazil's food recommendations differ from the map, and feature eight food groups: rice, bread, pasta, potato and cassavas (5 servings a day); vegetables and legumes (3 servings); fruits (3); milk, cheese and yogurt (3); beans (1); meat, fish and eggs (1); oils and fats (1); and sugars and sweets (no more than one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guia Alimentar|url=http://dab.saude.gov.br/portaldab/biblioteca.php?conteudo=publicacoes/guia_alimentar2014|work=Ministério da Saúde|language=Portuguese|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Canada's Food Guide}}
'''''[[Canada's Food Guide]]''''' from [[Health Canada]] is illustrated with a [[rainbow]] of four food groups: vegetables and fruit (7 to 10 servings a day for adults, depending on biological sex), grain products (6 to 8), milk and alternatives (2), and meat and alternatives (2 to 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide – A Resource for Educators and Communicators|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/res-educat/res-educat-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its [[World War II|wartime]] nutrition program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's Food Guides from 1942 to 1992|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/context/fg_history-histoire_ga-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[China]]'s [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Balanced Diet [[Pagoda]]''' ({{zh|[[wikt:平|平]][[wikt:衡|衡]][[wikt:膳|膳]][[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:宝|宝]][[wikt:塔|塔]]}}), which is divided into five [[storey|stories]] ascending from largest to smallest. Cereals are at the large base; topped by vegetables and fruits; then fish, poultry, meat, eggs and other animal foods; followed by milk and soy foods; and topped with fats and oils in the small [[spire]]. Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Health issued "China's Dietary Guidelines (2007)"|url=http://www.gov.cn/xwfb/2008-01/15/content_858517.htm|work=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents|url=http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|work=LinXia Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324232342/http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition Dietary Pagoda|url=http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805193525/http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2012|work=Public information network of MIYI county|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Denmark]]'s Food Administration uses the '''Diet Compass''' ({{lang-da|Kostkompasset}}) to depict its "Dietary 8" ({{lang-da|8 kostråd}}) guidelines, with an image on each compass point representing a guideline. Those guidelines are: "Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day," "Eat fish and seafood several times a week," "Eat potatoes, rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day," "Cut back on sugar," "Cut back on greasy foods," "Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight," "Quench your thirst with water," and, "Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kostkompasset|url=http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|work=Fødevarestyrelsen|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903205510/http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[France]]'s [[:fr:Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|National Institute for Prevention and Health Education]] has 25 separate food guides under the title '''The Food Guide For All''' ({{lang-fr|Le Guide Alimentaire Pour Tous}}). Each guide is based on a consumer's personality, habits and lifestyle. There are guides for people who: are health-conscious, don't care about food, prepare family meals, are poor, eat at restaurants, skip meals, don't cook, have large appetites, are on diets, prefer certain foods, avoid various foods (including meat), are sedentary, are athletic, and more. Each guide features a "portrait" in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumer's type. The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations, though they are more decorative than informative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le guide alimentaire pour tous|url=http://www.inpes.sante.fr/espace_nutrition/guide/presentation/mode.asp|work=Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Germany]]'s state-funded [[:de:Aid infodienst|Aid Information Service]] uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungspyramide}}), which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks, each block representing a hand-sized serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six blocks for beverages, three for vegetables, two for fruit, four for grains, three for dairy, one for meat and fish, one for oils, one for fats, and one for sweets and alcohol. Beverages, vegetables, fruit and grains are marked green for "free travel"; meat and dairy are marked yellow for "caution"; and oils, fats, sweets and alcohol are marked red for "brake lights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die aid-Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.was-wir-essen.de/gesund/empfehlungen_aid_pyramide.php|work=was-wir-essen|publisher=aid infodienst|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] pyramid model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die dreidimensionale Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=481|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]]'s [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad|National Institute of Nutrition]] publishes the '''''Dietary Guidelines for Indians''''', which, among other diagrams, includes the Food Pyramid. The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately, a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally, a third layer of meat, fish, eggs and oils to eat moderately, and an apex of fatty, salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly. Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity, as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Indians|url=http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|work=National Institute of Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516002639/http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The island of [[Ireland]]'s [[Food Safety Promotion Board]] uses '''The Food Pyramid''', which is divided into five levels: bread, cereals and potatoes at the large base (6 or more servings); then fruit and vegetables (5); followed by milk, cheese and yogurt (3); then meat, fish, eggs and alternatives (2); and finally fats, high fat/sugar snacks, foods and drinks at the apex (small amounts). At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Pyramid|url=http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|work=safefood|publisher=The Food Safety Promotion Board|accessdate=6 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712035747/http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-he|[[:he:פירמידת המזון|פירמידת המזון]]}}) from [[Israel]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]] is divided into six levels. At the wide base is water; followed by starches, including pasta, bread, corn and yams; then fruits and vegetables; then meat, fish, eggs and dairy; then fats and oils; and finally sugary foods at the small apex. Images around the pyramid represent exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Pyramid|url=http://www.health.gov.il/pages/default.asp?maincat=33&amp;catid=846|work=Ministry of Health|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Italian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-it|Piramide Alimentare Italiana}}), which is divided into squares, triangles, [[trapezoid]]s and rectangles that represent one, one-half, one-and-a-half, and two servings, respectively. Beginning from the base, the divisions are: fruit (2 servings), water (1), vegetables (2), bread (1.5), biscotti (0.5), potatoes (0.5), rice and pasta (1.5), meat (1), eggs (0.5), fish (0.5), legumes (0.5), [[cold cut]] meats (0.5), milk (0.5), dairy (0.5), oils and fats (1), sweets (0.5) and wine or beer (0.5). Along the edges of the pyramid are triangles representing physical activity. The pyramid is intended to represent the variety of foods eaten over an entire week, averaged into daily portions. Also provided is an alternative, more traditional pyramid for a single day, divided into six layers representing six food groups; as well as two additional pyramids for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The '''Food Guide''' ({{lang-ja|食事バランスガイド}}), from [[Japan]]'s [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Agriculture]] ministries, is depicted as a [[top|spinning top]] with a wide upper layer tapering to a narrow bottom. At the large upper level is a [[staple food|staple meal]] of carbohydrates, including rice, bread and noodles (5 to 7 servings a day); followed below by a [[side dish]] of vegetables, potatoes, beans (except soybeans), mushrooms and seaweed (5 to 6); then a smaller [[main course]] of protein, including meat, fish, eggs and soy (3 to 5); and finally the narrow point, divided between dairy (2) and fruit (2). The top's handle is filled with "essential" water and tea, and running in circles around the handle is a figure representing moderate exercise. A small [[motion lines|motion line]] beside the top represents sweet beverages in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Guide|url=http://www.maff.go.jp/j/balance_guide/|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[Mexico]]'s Department of Nutrition and Health Promotion uses '''The Plate of Good Eating''' ({{lang-es|El Plato del Bien Comer}}), which is divided into thirds: vegetables and fruits (in equal proportion); cereals; and legumes and animal products. The guide further recommends eating "many" vegetables and fruits and "enough" cereals. The legume and animal products section is subdivided, and "few" animal products are recommended, while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals. Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day, to eat the greatest possible variety of food, to eat according to individual needs and conditions, and to eat the least possible fats, oils, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Plato del Bien Comer|url=http://www.fns.org.mx/index.php?IdContenido=46|work=Fomento de Nutrición y Salud|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The [[Netherlands]] Nutrition Center uses the '''Wheel of Five''' ({{lang-nl|[[:nl:Schijf van vijf|De Schijf van Vijf]]}}), which is divided into five groups: approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit; 30 percent bread, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, couscous, and legumes; 16 percent dairy, meat, fish, eggs and meat substitutes; 16 percent beverages; and 8 percent fats and oils. More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Schijf van Vijf|url=http://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/schijf-van-vijf/schijf.aspx|work=Het Voedingscentrum|accessdate=4 June 2011|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]]'s Korean Nutrition Society uses the '''Food Bicycle''' ({{lang-ko|식품구성 자전거}}), with a small front wheel filled with water and a large rear wheel composed of approximately one-third grains; 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and beans; 20 percent vegetables; 12 percent fruits; 12 percent dairy; and 3 percent oils and sugars. A person is pedaling the bicycle, representing exercise. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans 2010|url=http://image.campushomepage.com/users/knsweb/ssugi513/DRIs/2010KDRIs_open_final.pdf|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Korean|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2010, South Korea used a [[:ko:파일:Korean food pyramid.jpg|food pagoda model]] very similar to China's current guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of dietary reference intake publilcations|url=http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=4 June 2011|location=Select first item dated 2007.04.11 (direct link does not work)|language=English, Korean|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235113/http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
[[Spain]]'s Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality uses the '''NAOS Pyramid''' ({{lang-es|Pirámide NAOS}}), which promotes a [[Mediterranean diet]] as well as plenty of physical activity, and is drawn as a sailboat on water. It is divided into beverages and water at the base; an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains, vegetables, tubers, fruit, olive oil and dairy in the second level, which is labeled "several times a day" and color-coded green; an equal division between sports and a combination of meat, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts in the third level, which is labeled "several times a week" and is color-coded orange; and an apex of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and sedentary activity labeled "occasionally" and color-coded red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirámide NAOS|url=http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|work=Ministerio de Sanidad, Política Social e Igualdad|publisher=Gobierno de España|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301064250/http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|archivedate=1 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[Sweden]]'s Food Agency uses the '''Plate Model''' ({{lang-sv|Tallriksmodellen}}), which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes, rice, pasta and bread; 40 percent vegetables and fruit; and 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and legumes. People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates, while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit.&lt;ref name=LVPlate/&gt;

Previously, Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963, while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the world's first food pyramid in 1974.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid/&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]]'s Federal Office of Public Health uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Lebensmittelpyramide}}) developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition. At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids, preferably non-sugared beverages; then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors; followed by whole grains, beans, cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal; then three servings of milk or dairy; one serving of meat, fish, eggs, cheese or another protein; oils, fats and nuts daily in moderation; and an apex of sweet/salty snacks and sweetened/alcoholic drinks in moderation for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102034630/http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|work=Bundesamt für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200158/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[Turkey]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Turkey)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Basic Food Groups''' ({{lang-tr|Temel Besin Grupları}}), a four-part division of milk and dairy; meat, eggs, fish, legumes and seeds; vegetables and fruit; and bread and cereal. Each food group is accompanied by bullet points, such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temel Besin Grupları|url=http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014130125/http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2010|work=Sağlık Bakanlığı|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Eatwell plate|Dietary Reference Values}}
[[File:Eatwell Plate.png|thumb|The Eatwell plate, as described by the United Kingdom's NHS and FSA.]]
The [[United Kingdom]]'s Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values. These are equivalent to the easier to understand [[Eatwell plate]] used by the [[National Health Service]]. This consists of roughly one-third fruit and vegetables ("at least 5 portions"); one-third bread, rice, potatoes and pasta ("plenty"); a smaller amount of milk and dairy ("some"); meat, fish, eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy ("some"); and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]], from the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]]]
{{main|MyPlate|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] uses '''[[MyPlate]]''', a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains, 30 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy. Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less, avoid oversized portions, make at least half of grains [[whole grain|whole]], switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, choose foods with less sodium, and drink water instead of sugary drinks.

Previous USDA food guides include the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic 7|Basic 7]] (1943–1956), the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic Four|Basic Four]] (1956–1992), the [[Food Guide Pyramid]] (1992–2005), and [[MyPyramid]] (2005–2011).

The [[National Institutes of Health]] uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop [[Hypertension]] ('''DASH''') '''Eating Plan''' for people seeking to lower their [[blood pressure]]. DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats, [[poultry]], and [[fish (food)|fish]]; there are separate sections for fats and [[vegetable fats and oils|oils]], legumes, and [[confectionery|sweets]]; and fruits and vegetables don't constitute half of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthier Eating with DASH|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716051126/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is the DASH Eating Plan?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/dash/dash_what.html|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] in the USDA and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] jointly release a longer textual document called ''[[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]'', updated in 2015 with the next scheduled revision in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietaryguidelines.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietary Reference Intake]] values are published by the [[Institute of Medicine]] for general use, but [[nutrition facts label]]s in the U.S. use the older [[Reference Daily Intake]] standards instead.

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] uses '''The 3 Fives''', a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories. The three categories are safer food, a healthy diet, and appropriate physical activity. In the healthy diet category, the five keys are: "Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life," "Eat a variety of food," "Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit," "Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil," and "Eat less salt and sugar." Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations. The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], but it can also be used for general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 3 Fives|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609134315/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before The 3 Fives, the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide, which included the CINDI pyramid. The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides. The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately two-thirds of the triangle's area, which is filled with vegetables, fruits, grains and starches. A middle layer shaded orange for "caution" is divided into two equal sections: low-fat milk and dairy; and beans, lentils, legumes, fish, eggs, poultry and lean meat. At the top is a small "red zone" of fats and sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CINDI dietary guide|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/119926/E70041.pdf|work=WHO Regional Office for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)===
FAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing, revising and implementing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) and food guides in line with current scientific evidence. FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines. FAO's food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food-based dietary guidelines|url=http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/home/en/|work=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other guides==
*The [[American Diabetes Association]] uses the '''Create Your Plate''' system, which divides a plate into three sections: non-starchy vegetables (the largest section), starchy foods, and meat or meat substitutes. Like [[MyPlate]], the ADA complements its plate with a glass of low-fat or nonfat milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create Your Plate|url=http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate/|work=American Diabetes Association|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Germany|German]] Nutrition Society ({{lang-de|[[:de:Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung]]}}) publishes the '''Food Circle''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungskreis}}), which is divided into 30 percent cereals and potatoes; 26 percent vegetables and salad; 17 percent fruit; 18 percent milk and dairy; 7 percent meat, sausage, fish and eggs; and 2 percent fats and oils. Beverages, represented by a glass of water, are placed in the interior of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=413|work=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] uses the '''[[Healthy eating pyramid|Healthy Eating Pyramid]]''', which is split into nine sections, including a base of daily exercise and weight control. Compared to MyPlate, grains become whole grains, with refined grains in a "use sparingly" category; protein is split between "fish, poultry and [[egg (food)|eggs]]" and "[[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Seed#Edible seeds|seeds]], [[bean]]s and [[tofu]]" with [[red meat]] and processed meat in a "use sparingly" category; healthy fats and oils have their own section; and dairy can be substituted with calcium and vitamin D [[dietary supplement|supplements]]. To the side of the pyramid are [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in moderation and a daily [[multivitamin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Massachusetts]] Department of Health and Human Services uses the '''Plate Method''', which shows a plate that is one-half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains and starches, and one-quarter meat and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use the Plate Method|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2terminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Consumer&amp;L2=Prevention+and+Wellness&amp;L3=Healthy+Living&amp;L4=Eat+Better&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_mass_in_motion_eat_better_plate_method&amp;csid=Eeohhs2|work=Massachusetts Health and Human Services|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]]
*The [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] uses the '''Power Plate''', which promotes a [[vegan]] diet and is divided into equal parts fruit, grains, [[legume]]s and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Plate|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/powerplate/|work=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of Monitoring Lone Worker Safety==
Numerous methods have been developed and are currently in use by companies world-wide. These methods include:
* '''Phone-based check-in systems.''' Employees are required to call in to a designated receiver after a predetermined time. Check-ins are often performed hourly or bi-hourly. The two approaches to phone-based check-in systems are call centre-driven and cloud-based automated monitoring, which may use a [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]] (SaaS) model.
* '''Buddy systems.''' Employees may be paired up to perform certain tasks. Theoretically, should an emergency occur and one of the employees be rendered incapacitated, the other would remain available to call for help and provide aid.
* '''Safety monitoring smartphone applications.''' With the widespread adoption of [[smart phones]], the deployment of a dedicated application allowing employees to quickly request aid has become more feasible. These applications may provide a [[panic button]] or allow for prompt check-in without requiring a phone call to be made.
* '''Safety monitoring devices.''' Dedicated monitoring devices for monitoring local environmental conditions, such as dangerous levels of gases, that smartphone-based Lone Worker monitoring solutions are unable to account for.

{{Infobox manganese}}
'''Manganese''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mn''' and [[atomic number]] 25. It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.

Historically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].

In biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6}} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]]. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic [[plants]]. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a [[neurotoxin]] in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause [[manganism]], a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.

It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize.&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|edition=91–100 |pages=1110–1117|isbn=978-3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|author2=Wiberg, Egon|author3=Wiberg, Nils|language=German|chapter=Mangan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese metal and its common ions are [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elementmagn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303222309/http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elementmagn.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-03|title=Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |publisher=CRC press |isbn=978-0-8493-0485-9|first=David R. |last=Lide|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of manganese}}
Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn. Eighteen [[radioisotope]]s have been isolated and described, ranging in [[atomic weight]] from 46 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Mn) to 65 u (&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Mn). The most stable are &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years, &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 312.3 days, and &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt; Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Audi|first=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128 |date=2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

Manganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn decays to &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn is relatively rare, produced by [[cosmic rays]] impact on [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Jeorg|last2=Faestermann |first2=Thomas |title=Terrestrial manganese-53 – A new monitor of Earth surface processes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=251|issue=3–4 |pages=334–345|date=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.016 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..334S |last3=Herzog |first3=Gregory F. |last4=Knie |first4=Klaus |last5=Korschinek |first5=Gunther |last6=Masarik |first6=Jozef |last7=Meier |first7=Astrid |last8=Poutivtsev |first8=Michail |last9=Rugel |first9=Georg |last10=Schlüchter |first10=Christian |last11=Serifiddin |first11=Feride |last12=Winckler |first12=Gisela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with [[chromium]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]] and [[radiometric dating]]. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] and [[Palladium-107|&lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Pd]] for the early history of the [[solar system]]. Variations in &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr/&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several [[meteorite]]s suggest an initial &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn/&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from ''in situ'' decay of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn provides additional evidence for [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes immediately before coalescence of the [[solar system]].&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt;&lt;!-- {{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00312-9 |title=53Mn-53Cr evolution of the early solar system|year=1999|last1=Birck|first1=J. |last2=Rotaru|last3=Allègre|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=63|pages=4111|first2=M.|first3=C.|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63.4111B |issue=23–24}}{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00189-6|title=Early solar system timescales according to 53Mn-53Cr systematics |year=1998|last1=Lugmair |first1=G.|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=62|pages=2863|bibcode=1998GeCoA..62.2863L|issue=16 |last2=Shukolyukov |first2=A.}}{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1005243228503|year=2000|last1=Shukolyukov|first1=Alexander|last2=Lugmair |journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=92|pages=225|first2=Günter W.|bibcode=2000SSRv...92..225S}}{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gca.2008.03.023|title=53Mn–53Cr systematics of the early Solar System revisited|year=2008|last1=Trinquier|first1=A. |last2=Birck|last3=Allègre|last4=Göpel|last5=Ulfbeck |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=72|pages=5146|first2=J.|first3=C. |first4=C.|first5=D.|bibcode=2008GeCoA..72.5146T |issue=20}}--&gt;

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; often competes with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a few oxyhalides (MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), are powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing agents]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to [[disproportionation]].

The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as [[manganese(II) sulfate]] (MnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[manganese(II) chloride]] (MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ([[manganese(II) carbonate]]). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).&lt;ref name="Saha 1703–1708"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saha|first=Amrita|last2=Majumdar|first2=Partha|last3=Goswami|first3=Sreebrata|title=Low-spin manganese(II) and cobalt(III) complexes of N-aryl-2-pyridylazophenylamines: new tridentate N,N,N-donors derived from cobalt mediated aromatic ring amination of 2-(phenylazo)pyridine.

The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like [[manganese(III) acetate]], but these are quite powerful [[Redox|oxidizing agents]] and also prone to [[disproportionation]] in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the [[Jahn-Teller effect]].

The oxidation state +5 can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten [[sodium nitrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. B. |last=Temple|author2=Thickett, G.

Permanganate (+7 oxidation state) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. [[Potassium permanganate]], [[sodium permanganate]], and [[barium permanganate]] are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory [[reagent]] because of its oxidizing properties; it is used as a topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.2.6.799 |last=Luft |first=J.

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The female ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]]. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove color from glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.133.3467.1824|date=1961|last=Sayre|first=E.

[[File:Gahn Johan Gottlieb.jpg|thumb|Credit for first isolating manganese is usually given to [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]].]]

Because it was used in glassmaking, [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. [[Ignatius Gottfried Kaim]] (1770) and [[Johann Glauber]] (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to [[permanganate]], a useful laboratory reagent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Centaurus|volume=19|issue=4|title=The Discovery of an Element|first=E.|last=Rancke-Madsen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1975.tb00329.x|pages=299–313|date=1975|bibcode=1975Cent...19..299R}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] used manganese dioxide to produce [[chlorine]]. First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the [[Sparta]]n steel exceptionally hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajim.20524|date=2007|title=From lead to manganese through mercury: mythology, science, and lessons for prevention|volume=50|issue=11|pages=779–787 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|pmid=17918211|last1=Alessio|first1=L.|last2=Campagna|first2=M.|last3=Lucchini|first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]] noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt; In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Production of Manganese Ferroalloys|publisher=Tapir Academic Press |date=2007|isbn=978-82-519-2191-6|chapter=History of omanganese|pages=11–12|author=Olsen, Sverre E.|author2=Tangstad, Merete |author3=Lindstad, Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the [[Leclanché cell]] in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic [[depolarizer]] increased the demand for manganese dioxide. Until the development of batteries with [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The [[zinc-carbon battery]] and the [[alkaline battery]] normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, [[manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.&lt;ref name="ChiuZMnO2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ciuz.19800140502|title=Moderne Verfahren der Großchemie: Braunstein |date=1980|last=Preisler|first=Eberhard|journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|language=German|volume=14|pages=137–148|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&amp;nbsp;°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.&lt;ref name="ManganeseRecovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|title=The Recovery of Manganese from low grade resources: bench scale metallurgical test program completed|date=2010|author=Chow, Norman|author2=Nacu, Anca|author3=Warkentin, Doug|author4=Aksenov, Igor|author5=Teh, Hoe|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Kemetco Research Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202065633/http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy.&lt;ref name=USGSMCS2009/&gt; In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), [[zinc]] and sometimes [[vanadium]] are viable substitutes.

===Steel===
[[File:M1917helmet.jpg|thumb|U.S. M1917 [[combat helmet]], a variant of [[Brodie helmet]], made from [[Hadfield steel]] manganese alloy.]]
Manganese is essential to iron and [[steelmaking|steel production]] by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, [[deoxidized steel|deoxidizing]], and [[alloying]] properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist [[Robert Forester Mushet]] (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of [[Spiegeleisen]], into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. [[Steelmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-87170-858-8|pages=56–57|first=John D. |last=Verhoeven|date=2007|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|title=Steel metallurgy for the non-metallurgist}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand.&lt;ref name="hydrometI"/&gt; Manganese is a key component of low-cost [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="MangUSGS2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648339|title=Mechanism of work hardening in Hadfield manganese steel|date=1981|last=Dastur|first=Y.

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid [[iron sulfide]] at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high [[tensile strength]] of up to 863&amp;nbsp;MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-4086-2616-0 |pages=351–352|title=Iron and Steel|first=John Henry|last=Stansbie|publisher=Read Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyogLqUxW1cC&amp;pg=PA351|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0|pages=585–587|last=Brady|first=George S.|author2=Clauser, Henry R. |author3=Vaccari.

==Biological role==
[[File:Arginase.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reactive center of arginase with boronic acid [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] – the manganese atoms are shown in yellow.]]
Manganese is an important element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as [[manganism]], a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daiana|last1=Silva Avila|first2=Robson|last2=Luiz Puntel|first3=Michael|last3=Aschner|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel |editor3=Roland K.

The [[reverse transcriptase]]s of many [[retrovirus]]es (though not [[lentivirus]]es such as [[HIV]]) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing [[polypeptides]] may be [[arginase]], the [[diphtheria toxin]], and Mn-containing [[superoxide dismutase]] ([[Mn-SOD]]).&lt;ref name="Mnzym"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0898-8838(08)60152-X|title=Manganese Redox Enzymes and Model Systems: Properties, Structures, and Reactivity|date=1998|last=Law|first=N.|volume=46|page=305|last2=Caudle|first2=M.|last3=Pecoraro|first3=V.|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|isbn=9780120236466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]], and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.

The human body contains about 12&amp;nbsp;mg of manganese, mostly in the bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001"/&gt; In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese [[metalloprotein]]s, most notably [[glutamine synthetase]] in [[astrocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(02)00234-5|title=Manganese action in brain function|date=2003 |last=Takeda |first=A.|journal=Brain Research Reviews|volume=41|issue=1|pmid=12505649|pages=79–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal [[Oxygen evolution|photooxidation of water]] during the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]], and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Umena|first=Yasufumi|last2=Kawakami|first2=Keisuke|last3=Shen|first3=Jian-Ren|last4=Kamiya |first4=Nobuo|title=Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å|journal=Nature|volume=473|issue=7345|pages=55–60|doi=10.1038/nature09913|pmid=21499260|date=May 2011|bibcode=2011Natur.473...55U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dismukes|first=G.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs). As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name=MnDRI&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Manganese|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/12 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages=394–419|pmid=25057538|isbn=978-0-309-07279-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese deficiency is rare.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese |title=Manganese|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=[[Oregon State University]] [[Linus Pauling Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR.

For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in neurological disorders==

===Manganism===
{{Main|Manganism}}
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with [[manganism]], a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys&lt;ref&gt;Baselt, R. (2008) ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, pp. 883–886, {{ISBN|0-9626523-7-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1021970120965|date=2002|author=Normandin, Louise|journal=Metabolic Brain Disease |volume=17|pages=375–87|pmid=12602514|last2=Hazell|first2=A. S.|title=Manganese neurotoxicity: an update of pathophysiologic mechanisms |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations.&lt;ref name="osha.gov" /&gt; The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couper|first=John|title=On the effects of black oxide of manganese when inhaled into the lungs|journal=Br. Ann. Med. Pharm. Vital. Stat. Gen. Sci.|date=1837|volume=1 |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles [[Parkinson's disease]]. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance.&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cersosimo|first=M.

S.|author2=Huang, C.C |author3=Chu, N.S. |author4=Calne, D.B. |title=Levodopa failure in chronic manganism|journal=Neurology|date=1994|volume=44|pages=1600–1602|doi=10.1212/WNL.44.9.1600|pmid=7936281|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.&lt;ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346" /&gt;

Chronic manganese exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism-like illness characterized by movement abnormalities.&lt;ref name=Guilarte2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilarte TR, Gonzales KK | title = Manganese-Induced Parkinsonism Is Not Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease: Environmental and Genetic Evidence | journal = Toxicol.

Animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions. In (non-aggressive) rats, manganese induces mouse-killing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazrishvili et al.|first1=I.|title=Manganese loading induces mouse-killing behaviour in nonaggressive rats|journal=J.

===Childhood developmental disorders===
Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on [[child development]]. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.&lt;ref name="Bouchard 138–143" /&gt;

The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L.&lt;ref name="EPA drinking water"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Contaminants|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called [[DMT1]] is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[DMT1]] also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1177">'''Medical care ratio''' ('''MCR'''), also known as '''medical cost ratio''', '''medical loss ratio''', and '''medical benefit ratio''', is a metric used in [[managed health care]] and [[health insurance]] to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Slee, Vergil N. and H. Joachim Schmidt. (2007) ''Slee's Health Care Terms''. Boston: Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers p. 344. {{ISBN|0-7637-4615-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[loss ratio]], which is a common metric in insurance measuring the percentage of premiums paid out in claims rather than expenses and profit provision. It is calculated by dividing those premiums allocated for fully insured or [[self-funded health care]] coverage into the total expenses for inpatient, professional (physicians and other licensed providers), outpatient, and [[pharmacy]]. (Briefly, MCR = Costs/Premiums.) As a general rule, a medical cost ratio of 85% or less is desirable. Some insurers now call MCR ''[[benefit–cost ratio]]'' (BCR). In the [[United States]], the term is ''medical loss ratio''.

'''Medical foods''' are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/CFR101-9.HTML|title=CFR 21 Part 101 Subpart A|author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In Europe the [[European Food Safety Authority]] established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcome of a public consultation on the Draft Scientific and Technical Guidance of the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on foods for special medical purposes in the context of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2015.EN-904/pdf|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food for special medical purposes|url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/special_groups_food/medical_en|publisher=European Commission|language=en|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a [[health claim]], and from dietary supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:&lt;ref name="FDA2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food And Drug Administration Compliance Program Guidance Manual: Chapter 21 – Food Composition, Standards, Labeling And Economics|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/complianceenforcement/ucm073339.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA_1116"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Statutes &amp; Regulations on Dietary Treatment of Disorders Identified Through Newborn Screening November 2016|url=http://www.nccrcg.org/docs/NCC/ACA/Products/Dietary_Treament_Supplements_2016.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding ([[nasogastric tube]])
* be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
* be intended to be used under medical supervision.

Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:
*Nutritionally complete formulas
*Nutritionally incomplete formulas
*Formulas for metabolic disorders
*Oral rehydration products

==Regulation==
Medical foods are regulated by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act regulations.  21 CFR 101.9(j) (8).&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"/&gt;

The term medical food, as defined in section 5(b) of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm|title=Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information|first=Office of Regulatory|last=Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical foods are not required to undergo premarket review or approval by FDA. Additionally, they are exempted from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In 2016 the FDA published an update: Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition. Definitions and labeling requirements are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm|title=Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''mental health in the Middle East''' is an area of [[research]] that continues to grow in its scope and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health and psychiatry in the Middle East: historical development|author=A.

The (WFMH) was originally created in 1948 and works in concert with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).  The 1998 [[Statistical survey|survey]] sought to help define and clarify [[mental health]] Issues across many [[societies]].

To accurately evaluate and understand the mental health issues of the [[Middle East]], one must take into account the [[geography|geographic]], [[history|historical]], [[culture|cultural]], and social influences of that part of the world.  While each of the many countries commonly considered part of the "Middle East" is unique, there is a binding [[ethnic]] fabric that should be considered.  Firstly, the Middle East is the origin of many of the major world [[religions]]. [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]]  and [[Islam]], all began in this region.  Of these many religions, Islam has had the most lasting and [[cultural]]ly significant influence on the region, encompassing well over ninety percent (90%) of the [[population]] by some measurements.  The tenets of the [[Islamic faith]], and its strict purpose, certainly have served as both a guide and a hindrance to the practices' of [[mental health care]] providers in the Middle East.  There is a conflict between ancient religious teachings and the modern day or "[[Western world]]" approach to the issues of mental health.

==Historical perspective==

[[Mental health]] in the [[Middle East]], from [[Pharaonic]] times through to the [[Islamic Renaissance]], has a rich and complex history. During Pharaonic times, [[wikt:soma|soma]] and [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] were terms used to define [[mental disorders]], and such disorders were described as problems of the [[heart]] or [[uterus]], as stated in Eber's and Kahoun's Papyri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wrf.org/ancient-medicine/oldest-medical-books.php|title=Magic and Medical Science in Ancient Egypt|year=1963|author=Ghalioungui, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[mystical]] culture predominated at that time, mental disorders were treated on a [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] basis. In the [[Islamic]] era, those with mental illness were not known to have endured any forms of [[torture]], nor were they [[ostracism|ostracized]]; this was due to the belief that [[Spirit possession|possession]] by a good Muslim [[genie]] was possible. The first [[mental hospital]] in [[Europe]] was located in [[Spain]], as discussed by author [[Paul Ghalioungui]], following the [[Moorish invasions]]. Mental hospitals then expanded to other European countries. The occurrence of [[anxiety]], [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]], [[conversion disorders]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorders]] had been reported, and these disorders were treated with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/ancient-egypt/|title=Ancient Egypt - Treatment of the Mentally Ill|website=mentalillness.umwblogs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality]] and [[culture]] most likely arose from a [[collective]] choice of [[communal]] decisions to provide an accepted structure of communal living. [[Geography]], [[tradition]], and the specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may have been most influential in these decisions.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=what decisions, exactly?}} The development or evolution of a [[Social environment|social milieu]] integrated with the culmination of culture.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=the previous sentence does not make sense}} Cultural [[morality]] has provided a way of managing [[conflict (process)|conflict]] within a societal group.  Cultural morality and the required [[behaviors]] that are cooperative in nature and a cognizance of others within the group, ostracized [[unhealthy]] behaviors, and therefore encouraged [[emotions]] and actions beneficial to [[society]].  These realized constructs provided an outlet and model of [[motivation]]s and accepted actions within a [[social group]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Wong, "Natural Moralities," (October 2006), Oxford University Press, 2006 [abs].&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1992 study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/7_creativity/2010/2PersonalityAndValues.pptx Personality and Values] (PPT)&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz, Roccas and Sagiv evaluated how priorities are displayed and altered by a "social experience",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11927158 | volume=109 | title=Social experience and social context alter the behavioral response to centrally administered oxytocin in female Syrian hamsters | journal=Neuroscience | pages=767–72 | last1 = Harmon | first1 = AC | last2 = Moore | first2 = TO | last3 = Huhman | first3 = KL | last4 = Albers | first4 = HE | doi=10.1016/s0306-4522(01)00523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how those priorities affect "behavioral orientation and choices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = Shalom H | year = 1992 | title = Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 1–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study surmised that the majority of cultures prioritize some of ten particular [[values|value]] types: [[self-determination]], [[stimulation]], [[hedonism]], [[accomplishment|achievement]], [[power (philosophy)|power]], [[security]], [[conformity]], [[tradition]], [[altruism|benevolence]], and [[universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/schwartz_inventory.htm|title=Schwartz's Value Inventory|website=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these there were [[values]] that [[culture]]s prioritize to varying degrees.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=This whole paragraph needs a rewrite, because it doesn't make any sense}}

Schwartz used these findings in developing his [[theory]] of specific types of [[values]], allowing varying cultures to be contrasted with one another. Data was collected from 49 countries and applied to a [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of seven value types. This was done according to the specific priority given by a society to its [[communal]] value set. Schwartz selected the seven types of values based on their compatibilities and [[contradiction]]s to one another. The value types he identified were: "[[conservatism]] vs. [[autonomy]]", "[[hierarchy]] vs. [[egalitarianism]]", and "[[mastery]] vs. [[harmony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260108602816|title=Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Academic Press|volume=25|pages=1–65|citeseerx=10.1.1.220.3674|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6|author= Schwartz, Shalom H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[value (personal and cultural)|value types]] were then used to examine [[culture]]s that were closely
related to each other. The theory is based on [[cultural]] dimensions so that conclusions can be defined to a degree, while accounting for the entire social matrix.{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=The meaning of this sentence is unclear}}  This theory has helped [[researchers]] to assess the cultural implications of values on regional cultures.  The research also found a [[correlation]] between geographical proximity and shared cultural values. Schwartz attributed these relationships to the "shared [[history]]", [[religion]], level of development, culture contact, and other factors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shwartz, S.|year=1999|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/people/sharon.glazer/courses/psyc190/s1/Schwartz+1999.pdf|title=A theory of cultural values and some implications for work|volume=48|issue=1|pp=23–47|journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review|publisher=International association of applied psychology|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626115004/http://www.sjsu.edu/people/sharon.glazer/courses/psyc190/s1/Schwartz%201999.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known syndromes==

===Zār===

[[Zār]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zar|title=ZĀR – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_glos.html TMH: Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526131405/http://homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_glos.html |date=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (زار) known as [[Demonic possession|possession]] by a [[spirit]], is exhibited by some Middle Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturediversity.org/mide.htm Middle Eastern&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725214245/http://www.culturediversity.org/mide.htm |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific ceremonies are performed to placate the zār and relieve the symptoms of the afflicted individual. These [[ritual]]ized ceremonies, organized and facilitated by a leader, include the affected individual and a person previously affected by the zār, and involve "[[incense]], music, and movement".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The details of the [[ceremony]] vary by region.  Some leaders may recommend that the [[patient]] first seek the help of a [[Physician|doctor]], while others believe that interventions by the doctor, such as using needles for injections, may further agitate the zār, creating more problems for the patient.  Those who choose traditional treatment for zār remain in isolation for up to seven days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This [[syndrome]] has been reported in [[North Africa]]n and Middle Eastern countries, including [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], and [[Sudan]]. Signs and [[symptoms]] of zār may include [[dissociative state|dissociative]] episodes, unexpected laughing, yelling, or singing, or even patients hitting their heads against a wall. Clients may exhibit [[apathy]] and be [[reclusive]].  Those under the influence of the zār may refuse to eat or carry out [[activities of daily living]], and may develop an extended interaction with the possessing spirit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===The evil eye===
[[File:Ruby Eye Pendant.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Corundum]] Evil Eye [[Amulet]] from [[Mesapotamia]]  ʘDanieliness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Danieliness|title=User:Danieliness - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The "[[evil eye]]" is also known as ʿayn al-ḥasūd (عين الحسود)" and "Mal De Ojo", and has been described by a number of sources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It is also described in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[culture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://altmed.creighton.edu/MexicanFolk/mal_de_ojo.htm Mal de ojo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719181959/http://altmed.creighton.edu/MexicanFolk/mal_de_ojo.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbardo.com/maldeojo.htm|title=Evil Eye - Mal de Ojo|website=www.sfbardo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dundes A, "Interpreting Folklore," Indiana University Press, Ed.,(1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dundes A"The Evil Eye: A Casebook." [[University of Wisconsin]] Press, Ed.,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The late Professor [[Alan Dundes]] theorized that belief in the evil eye had a [[Middle Eastern]], [[Mediterranean]], and [[Indo European]] pattern of distribution, and was completely unknown in the [[Americas]], [[Pacific Islands]], [[Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until the introduction of European and possibly [[Moorish]] culture.  He based his ideas upon the ancient underlying belief that water represented [[life]] and dryness represented [[death]]. Dundes suggested that evil caused by the evil eye came from its power to cause living beings to "dry up", specifically referring to infants, [[lactation|lactating]] [[mammal]]s, and even young fruit trees.&lt;ref&gt;Fables of the Ancients: Folklore in the Qur'an. Rowman &amp; Littlefield,(2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms included sudden [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and loss of [[virility|potency]] in men. Dundes contended that the evil eye dries up liquids, which explained its Middle Eastern and [[desert]] origins. This unique [[syndrome]] is also mentioned in the [[DSM-IV TR]], Appendix I.&lt;ref&gt;^"Appendix I: Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes". Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), 1. 2000. {{doi|10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349.7060}}. {{ISBN|0-89042-334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The syndrome is also seen in many other [[Middle Eastern]] Countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Post-traumatic stress syndrome===
[[Post-traumatic stress syndrome]] (PTSD) is, unfortunately, common in the Middle East due to the myriad conflicts experienced by people in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/newsletters/research-quarterly/v21n4.pdf | title=Trauma and PTSD among Civilians in the Middle East | journal=PTSD Research Quarterly| volume =21|number= 4 |year=2010|author1=Yuval Neria|author2=Margarita Bravova|author3=Jessica M. Halper.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include recurrent experiencing of the  initial [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic event(s) through [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s or recurrent [[night sweats]] and [[nightmare]]s. Those afflicted with post-traumatic stress syndrome often seek to avoid others as well as any [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] similar to the traumatic occurrence.  They may also exhibit increased [[arousal]]. Difficulty in falling or staying asleep, unexpected episodic fits of [[anger]], and [[hypervigilance]] may also occur. The formal [[diagnostic criteria]] for both the [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD-10]]) indicate that symptoms last for more than one month and cause significant impairment in [[social functioning|social]], occupational, and/or other important areas of functioning.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV. [[Washington, DC]]: American Psychiatric Association. {{ISBN|0-89042-061-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some evidence that children suffering from PTSD in the Middle East may experience accelerated aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/pages/2015-05-07-ptsd-accelerates-aging.aspx|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Linked to Accelerated Aging|work=UC Health - UC San Diego|date=May 7, 2015|author1=Scott LaFee|author2=Heather Buschman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] in the Middle East has been specifically studied at [[Namazi Hospital]] Shiraz, in Iran.  In a 2006 study of nurses, depressive symptoms were seen in 26.9% of the individuals studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mejfm.com/journal/july2006/Depression%20in%20nurses.htm|title=Middle East Journal of Family Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/complete-index.shtml|title=NIMH » Depression Basics|website=www.nimh.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this [[cross-sectional survey]], the rate of depression in 130 nurses was investigated using the 21-item [[Beck Depression Inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = AT | last2 = Ward | first2 = CH | last3 = Mendelson | first3 = M | last4 = Mock | first4 = J | last5 = Erbaugh | first5 = J | year = 1961 | title = An inventory for measuring depression | url = | journal = Arch.

The '''National Survey on Drug Use and Health''', often abbreviated '''NSDUH''', is an annual nationwide survey on the use of legal and [[illegal drug]]s, as well as [[mental disorder]]s, that has been conducted by the [[United States]] [[United States federal government|federal government]] since 1971.&lt;ref name=samhsa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh/about | title=About Population Data / NSDUH | work=SAMHSA | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), and is supervised by the SAMHSA's [[Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/project_description.html | title=About the Survey | work=NSDUH website | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey interviews about 70,000 Americans aged 12 and older, through face-to-face interviews conducted where the respondent lives.&lt;ref name=samhsa/&gt; In 1988, [[RTI International]] started conducting the survey, and they have been contracted by SAMHSA to continue doing so through 2017.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; It was originally called the '''National Household Survey on Drug Abuse''', but was renamed in 2002 to its current name.&lt;ref name=samhsa/&gt; The NSDUH, along with the [[Monitoring the Future]], is one of the two main ways the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] measures drug use in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/drug-use | title=Drug use | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diet and physical activity are difficult to measure accurately, which may partly explain why [[nutrition]] has received less attention than other [[risk factors]] for disease in [[epidemiology]].

'''Occupational stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] related to one's job. Occupational stress often stems from unexpected responsibilities and pressures that do not align with a person's knowledge, skills, or expectations, inhibiting one's ability to cope. Occupational stress can increase when workers do not feel supported by supervisors or colleagues, or feel as if they have little control over work processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Stress at the workplace|url = http://www.who.int/occupational_health/topics/stressatwp/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Because stress results from the complex interactions between a large system of interrelated variables, there are several [[psychological theory|psychological theories]] and models that address occupational stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Predicting employee life satisfaction: a coherent model of personality, work and nonwork experiences, and domain satisfactions|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=84|issue=4|pages=564–584|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.84.4.564|pmid=|via=|last1=Hart|first1=P.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, C.L. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Mark, G.M, and Smith, Andrew Paul. 2008. ''Stress models: a review and suggested new direction. Occupational Health Psychology'', European Perspectives On Research, Education and Practice, vol. 3. Nottingham: Nottingham University Press, pp. 111–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Person–environment fit|Person-environment fit model]]''': This model "suggests that the match between a person and their work environment is key in influencing their health. For healthy conditions, it is necessary that employees’ attitudes, skills, abilities and resources match the demands of their job, and that work environments should meet workers’ needs, knowledge, and skills potential. Lack of fit in either of these domains can cause problems, and the greater the gap or misfit (either subjective or objective) between the person and their environment, the greater the strain as demands exceed abilities, and need exceeds supply. These strains can relate to health related issues, lower [[productivity]], and other work problems. Defense mechanisms, such as denial, reappraisal of needs, and coping, also operate in the model, to try and reduce subjective misfit".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Job characteristic theory|Job characteristics model]]''': This model "focuses on important aspects of job characteristics, such as skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. These characteristics are proposed to lead to ‘critical psychological states’ of experienced meaningfulness, and experienced responsibility and knowledge of outcomes. It is proposed that positive or negative work characteristics give rise to mental states which lead to corresponding cognitive and behavioral outcomes, e.g. motivation, satisfaction, absenteeism, etc. In conjunction with the model, Hackman and Oldham (1980) developed the Job Diagnostic Survey, a questionnaire for job analysis, which implies key types of job-redesign including combining tasks, creating feedback methods, job enrichment, etc."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Diathesis–stress model]]''': This model looks at behaviors as a susceptibility burden together with stress from life experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2002-13306-001{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, P.M. &amp; Cooper, C.L.

'''[[Job demands-resources model]]''': This model posits that strain are a response to imbalance between demands of one's job and the resources he or she has to deal with those demands.

* '''Job demands''': the physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of a job that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills. Therefore, they are associated with expenditure of time and energy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The job demands–resources model and counterproductive work behaviour: The role of job-related affect|journal = European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|date = 2011-08-01|issn = 1359-432X|pages = 467–496|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13594321003669061|first = Cristian|last = Balducci|first2 = Wilmar B.|last2 = Schaufeli|first3 = Franco|last3 = Fraccaroli|url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/486986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Job resources''': the physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that aid in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological cost; stimulate personal growth, learning, and development.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

'''Effort-reward imbalance model''': This model focuses on the reciprocal relationship between efforts and rewards at work. "More specifically, the ERI Model claims that work characterized by both high efforts and low rewards represents a reciprocity deficit between high ‘costs’ and low ‘gains’, which could elicit negative emotions in exposed employees. The accompanying feelings may cause sustained strain reactions. So, working hard without receiving adequate appreciation or being treated fairly are examples of a stressful imbalance. Another assumption of the ERI Model concerns individual differences in the experience of effort-reward imbalance. It is assumed that employees characterized by a motivational pattern of excessive job-related commitment and a high need for approval (i.e., overcommitment) will respond with more strain reactions to an effort-reward imbalance, in comparison with less overcommitted people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jandejonge.nl/research_eri.html|title = Effort-Reward Imbalance Model|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = de Jonge|first = Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Sources of occupational stress come from:&lt;ref name = Colligan2006/&gt;
{{div col}}
* a [[toxic workplace|toxic work environment]]
* negative [[workload]]
* isolation
* financial pressures
* types of hours worked
* [[role conflict]] &amp; role ambiguity
* lack of autonomy, career development barriers
* difficult relationships with administrators and/or coworkers
* [[workplace bullying|managerial bullying]]
* [[Workplace harassment|harassment]]
* [[organizational climate]]&lt;ref name="Colligan2006" /&gt;
{{div col end}}

These individual sources demonstrate that stress can occur specifically when a conflict arises from the job demands of the employee and the employee itself. If not handled properly, the stress can become [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000103|Acute respiratory distress syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coping''': the ability of the employee coping with the specific hours worked, the level of productive rate expected, the physical environment, as well as the expectancy of the work desired by [[management]]. For instance, research shows that night shifts in particular has a high possibility of negative impact towards the health of the employee. In relation to this, approximately 20 percent of night shift workers have experienced psycho-physiological dysfunctions, including heart diseases. Extreme factors can affect the competence levels of employees.
* '''Role in the organization''': associated with the hierarchical ranking of that particular employee within the organization. Upper management is entitled to oversee the overall functioning of the organization. This causes potential distress as the employee must be able to perform simultaneous tasks.
* '''Career development''': Security of their occupation, promotion levels, etc. are all sources of stress, as this business market in terms of technology of economic dominance is ever-changing.
* '''[[Interpersonal relationships]]''' within the workplace: The workplace is a communication and interaction-based industry. These relationships (either developed or developing) can be problematic or positive. Common stressors include harassment, discrimination, biased opinions, hearsay, and other derogatory remarks.
* '''[[Organizational climate]] or structure''': The overall communication, management style, and participation among groups of employees are variables to be considered. In essence, the resultant influence of the high participation rate, collaborative planning, and equally dispersed responsibilities provides a positive effect on stress reduction, improved work performance, job satisfaction, and decreased [[psychosomatic disorders]].

==Prevalence==
[[File:Work related stress infographic.png|thumb|400px]]
Distress is a prevalent and costly problem in today's workplace. About one-third of workers report high levels of stress.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt; 20–30% of workers in different sectors of the [[European Union]] reported in 2007 that they believed work-related stress was potentially affecting their health.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Naghieh |first1=Ali |last2=Montgomery |first2=Paul |last3=Bonell |first3=Christopher P |last4=Thompson |first4=Marc |last5=Aber |first5=J Lawrence |last6=Naghieh |first6=Ali |title=Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=4 |issue= 4|pages=CD010306 |year=2015 |pmid=25851427 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010306.pub2 |url=http://gala.gre.ac.uk/19937/7/19937%20NAGIEH_Organisational_Interventions_for_%20Improving_Wellbeing_2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-quarters of employees believe the worker has more on-the-job stress than a generation ago.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton Survey Research Associates [1997]. Labor day survey: state of workers. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Survey Research Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Great Britain]], a sixth of the workforce experiences occupational stress every year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence also suggests that distress is the major cause of [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] in organizations.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt; With continued distress at the workplace, workers will develop psychological and physiological dysfunctions and decreased motivation in excelling in their position.&lt;ref name = Colligan2006/&gt;  Increased levels of job stress are determined by the awareness of having little control but lots of demands in the work area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/#sthash.Mep5bsfR.dpuf{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational stress and its sequelae represent the majority of work-related illnesses causing missed work days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those in the protective services, transportation and materials moving, building grounds cleaning and maintenance, and healthcare are more susceptible to both work injuries and illnesses, as well as work-related stress.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sedgwick.com/news/Documents/Studies/Workplace%20Stress%20UIC%20study.pdf|title = Stress in the Workplace: A Policy Synthesis on Its Dimensions and Prevalence|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Dopkeen, Jonathan|first = Dubois, Renee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative health effects==
Stress-related disorders encompass a broad array of conditions, including [[psychological disorders]] (e.g., [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]) and other types of emotional strain (e.g., dissatisfaction, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], etc.), maladaptive behaviors (e.g., [[aggression]], [[substance abuse]]), and cognitive impairment (e.g., concentration and memory problems). In turn, these conditions may lead to poor work performance, higher [[absenteeism]], less work productivity or even [[injury]].&lt;ref name=Colligan2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "If untreated, consistently high stress can become a chronic condition, which can exacerbate existing mental health conditions and chronic physical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, weak immune system). These conditions not only diminish the well-being of workers and increase the employer's health benefits expenses, they contribute to increased injury incidence. Consistently high levels of stress increase the risk of occupational injury. A study of light/short haul truckers, a group that experiences high rates of injury and mental health issues, found that frequent stress increased the odds of occupational injury by 350%."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Job stress is also associated with various biological reactions that may lead ultimately to compromised health, such as [[cardiovascular disease]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/workorg/|title=NIOSH Work Organization and Stress Related Disorders |accessdate=2007-12-01|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in extreme cases [[karoshi|death]]. Due to the high pressure and demands in the work place the demands have been shown to be correlated with increased rates of heart attack, hypertension and other disorders.  In New York, Los Angeles, and London, among other municipalities, the relationship between job stress and heart attacks is acknowledged.&lt;ref name="stress.org"&gt;http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems at work are more strongly associated with health complaints than are any other life stressor-more so than even financial problems or family problems.&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company [1992]. American workers under pressure technical report. St. Paul, MN: St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational stress accounts for more than 10% of work-related health claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruotsalainen|first=Jani H.|last2=Verbeek|first2=Jos H.|last3=Mariné|first3=Albert|last4=Serra|first4=Consol|date=2015-04-07|title=Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD002892|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25847433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].  Research indicates that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper-extremity [[musculoskeletal disorders]].&lt;ref name="Encyc_OSH"&gt;Sauter S, Hurrell J, Murphy L, Levi L [1997]. Psychosocial and organizational factors. In: Stellman J, ed. Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety. Vol. 1. Geneva, Switzerland: International Labour Office, pp. 34.1–34.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders that can be caused or exacerbated by occupational stress include [[sleep disorders]], [[headache]], [[mood disorders]], [[upset stomach]], [[hypertension]], [[high cholesterol]], [[autoimmune disease]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[anxiety]]. Stress at work can also increase the risk of acquiring an infection and the risk of accidents at work.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/765974|title = Alleviating Job Stress in Nurses|date = June 25, 2012|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Roberts|first = Rashaun|last2 = Grubb|first2 = Paula L.|last3 = Grosch|first3 = James W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High levels of stress are associated with substantial increases in health service utilization.&lt;ref name="NIOSH_Stressatwork" /&gt;  Workers who report experiencing stress at work also show excessive health care utilization. In a 1998 study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were nearly 50% greater for workers reporting high levels of stress in comparison to “low risk” workers. The increment rose to nearly 150%, an increase of more than $1,700 per person annually, for workers reporting high levels of both stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Goetzel, RZ, Anderson, DR, Whitmer, RW, Ozminkowski, RJ, Dunn, RL, Wasserman J [1998].

''J Occup Environ Med'' 40:843–854.&lt;/ref&gt; Health care costs increase by 200% in those with depression and high occupational stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, periods of [[disability]] due to job stress tend to be much longer than disability periods for other occupational injuries and illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH [2001]. NIOSH Worker Health Chartbook. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pub. No. 2004-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiological reactions to stress can have consequences for health over time. Researchers have been studying how stress affects the cardiovascular system, as well as how work stress can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[coronary artery disease]]. These diseases, along with other stress-induced illnesses tend to be quite common in American work-places.&lt;ref name="Primm2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Primm |first1=Dave |title=What workplace stress research is telling technical communicators |journal=Technical Communication |volume=52 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=449–55 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=0049-3155&amp;volume=52&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=449&amp;epage=455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main physiological reactions to stress:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mental_Health_Letter/2011/March/understanding-the-stress-response{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==

[[File:Frustrated man at a desk (cropped).jpg|thumb|Frustrated man at a desk]]
Men and women are exposed to many of the same stressors.&lt;ref name = Desmarais/&gt;  Although men and women might not differ in overall strains, women are more likely to experience psychological distress, whereas men experience more physical strain. Desmarais and Alksnis suggest two explanations for the greater psychological distress of women. First, the genders may differ in their awareness of negative feelings, leading women to express and report strains, whereas men deny and inhibit such feelings. Second, the demands to balance work and family result in more overall stressors for women that leads to increased strain.&lt;ref name = Desmarais&gt;Desmarais, S. &amp; Alksnis, C. (2005). Gender issues. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway, &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds). Handbook of work stress. (pp. 455–485). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kenexa Research Institute released a global survey of almost 30,000 workers which showed that females suffered more workplace distress than their male counterparts. According to the survey, women's stress level were 10% higher for those in supervisory positions, 8% higher stress in service and production jobs than men, and 6% higher in middle and upper management than men in the same position.&lt;ref&gt;"Workplace Stress Greater For Women". ''OfficePro''. Aug/Sep 2010; 70, 5; ProQuest. pg.8.{{unreliable source?|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Job stress results from various interactions of the worker and the environment of the work they perform their duties.  Location, gender, environment, and many other factors contribute to the buildup of stress.  Job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of job stress. The differing viewpoints suggest different ways to prevent stress at work. Differences in individual characteristics such as [[Personality pathology|personality]] and [[coping skill]]s can be very important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress.  In other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint underlies prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt; In general, occupational stress is caused by a mismatch between perceived effort and perceived reward, and/or a sense of low control in a job with high demands. Low social support at work and [[Job security|job insecurity]] can also increase occupational stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Psychosocial stressors]] are a major cause of occupational stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Working conditions ===
Although the importance of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for a greater emphasis on working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt; Large surveys of working conditions, including conditions recognized as risk factors for job stress, were conducted in member states of the [[European Union]] in 1990, 1995, and 2000. Results showed a time trend suggesting an increase in work intensity. In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-quarter of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60% in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in 1990) in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurofound.eu.int/publications/htmlfiles/ef00128.htm |title=Ten Years of Working Conditions in the European Union, 2005  |accessdate=2007-12-01|publisher=European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workload===
{{Main|Workload}}
In an occupational setting, dealing with workload can be stressful and serve as a [[stressor]] for employees. There are three aspects of workload that can be stressful.
:* '''Quantitative workload or overload''': Having more work to do than can be accomplished comfortably.
:* '''Qualitative workload''': Having work that is too difficult.
:* '''Underload''': Having work that fails to use a worker's skills and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). The social psychology of organizations 2ed. New York City: John Wiley.{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workload as a work demand is a major component of the demand-control model of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karasek | first1 = R. A. | year = 1979 | title = Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain-implications for job redesign | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 285–308 | doi=10.2307/2392498| jstor = 2392498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model suggests that jobs with high demands can be stressful, especially when the individual has low control over the job. In other words, control serves as a buffer or protective factor when demands or workload is high. This model was expanded into the demand-control-support model that suggests that the combination of high control and high social support at work buffers the effects of high demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J. V. | last2 = Hall | first2 = E. M. | year = 1988 | title = Job strain, work place social support, and cardiovascular disease: A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the Swedish working population | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 78 | issue = 10| pages = 1336–1342 | doi=10.2105/ajph.78.10.1336| pmid = 3421392 | pmc = 1349434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a work demand, workload is also relevant to the [[job demands-resources model]] of stress that suggests that jobs are stressful when demands (e.g., workload) exceed the individual's resources to deal with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A. B. | last3 = Nachreiner | first3 = F. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.

=== Long hours ===
A substantial percentage of Americans work very long hours. By one estimate, more than 26% of men and more than 11% of women worked 50 hours per week or more in 2000. These figures represent a considerable increase over the previous three decades, especially for women. According to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], there has been a rise in the number of hours in the work place by employed women, an increase in extended work weeks (&gt;40 hours) by men, and a considerable increase in combined working hours among working couples, particularly couples with young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bls.gov/opub/rtaw/rtawhome.htm  |title=Report on the American Workforce |accessdate=2007-12-01|publisher=United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs JA, Gerson K [2004].

[[File:My Boss Is A J-E-R-K! (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Evidence of occupational stress due to an individual's status in the workplace]]

=== Status ===
A person's [[occupational status|status in the workplace]] can also affect levels of stress. While workplace stress has the potential to affect employees of all categories; those who have very little influence to those who make major decisions for the company. However, less powerful employees (that is, those who have less [[job control (workplace)|control over their jobs]]) are more likely to suffer stress than powerful workers. Managers as well as other kinds of workers are vulnerable to work overload.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bohrf.org.uk/downloads/cmh_rev.pdf{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic factors ===
Economic factors that employees face in the 21st century have been linked to increased stress levels. Researchers and social commentators have pointed out that the computer and communications revolutions have made companies more efficient and productive than ever before. This increase in productivity, however, has caused higher expectations and greater competition, putting more stress on the employee.&lt;ref name=Primm2005/&gt;

The following economic factors may lead to workplace stress: 
* Pressure from investors, who can quickly withdraw their money from company stocks.
* The lack of trade and professional unions in the workplace
* Inter-company rivalries caused by the efforts of companies to compete globally
* The willingness of companies to swiftly lay off workers to cope with changing business environments

=== Bullying ===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Bullying in the workplace can also contribute to stress. This can be broken down into five categories:&lt;ref name=Colligan2006/&gt;
* Threat to profession status
* Threat to personal status
* Isolation
* Excess work
* [[Destabilization]], i.e. lack of credit for work, meaningless tasks, etc.&lt;ref name=Colligan2006/&gt;

=== Narcissism and psychopathy ===
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Thomas suggests that there tends to be a higher level of stress with people who work or interact with a [[narcissist]], which in turn increases [[absenteeism]] and [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is a corporate [[psychopath]] in the organisation.&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace conflict===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Interpersonal conflict among people at work has been shown to be one of the most frequently noted stressors for employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = A. | last2 = Newton | first2 = T. | year = 1985 | title = Stressful events, stressors and psychological strains in young professional engineers | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Behaviour | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1002/job.4030060206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = C. | last2 = Spector | first2 = P.

It also relates to strains such as [[anxiety]], depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Women are more likely than men to experience sexual harassment, especially for those working in traditionally masculine occupations{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="stress.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/00178969/v64i0003/271_trogiwsaclr.xml | title=The role of gender in workplace stress: A critical literature review | author=Gyllensten, K. | journal=Health Education Journal | year=2005 | issue=64 (3) | pages=271–288 | doi=10.1177/001789690506400307 | volume=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that level of [[workplace harassment|harassment at workplaces]] lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of harassment were related to the worst outcomes, and no harassment was related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women who had experienced a higher level of harassment were more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Occupational group ===

Lower occupational groups are at higher risk of work-related ill health than higher occupational groups. This is in part due to adverse work and employment conditions. Furthermore, such conditions have greater effects on ill-health to those in lower socio-economic positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://health-gradient.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DRIVERS_WP3_Fair_Employment_Final_Report.pdf{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Stressful working conditions can lead to three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood).&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S. M. (1998). Stress and job performance: Theory, research, and implications for managerial practice.

An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted with a sample of 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bromet |first1=Evelyn J. |last2=Dew |first2=Mary Amanda |last3=Parkinson |first3=David K. |last4=Cohen |first4=Shelly |last5=Schwartz |first5=Joseph E. |title=Effects of occupational stress on the physical and psychological health of women in a microelectronics plant |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1377–83 |year=1992 |pmid=1529375 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90146-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among the [[Japan]]ese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with [[job strain]] (combination of high job demand and low job control).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsutsumi |first1=Akizumi |last2=Kayaba |first2=Kazunori |last3=Kario |first3=Kazuomi |last4=Ishikawa |first4=Shizukiyo |title=Prospective Study on Occupational Stress and Risk of Stroke |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=169 |issue=1 |pages=56–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19139324 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2008.503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mind/Body Health: Job Stress|url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/job-stress.aspx|website = American Psychological Association|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of [[high blood pressure]], [[immune system]] dysfunction, [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuehnl |first1=Andreas |last2=Rehfuess |first2=Eva |last3=von Elm |first3=Erik |last4=Nowak |first4=Dennis |last5=Glaser |first5=Jürgen |last6=Kuehnl |first6=Andreas |title=Human resource management training of supervisors for improving health and well-being of employees |year=2014 |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |pages=CD010905 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged occupational stress can lead to [[occupational burnout]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The effects of job stress on [[chronic diseases]] are more difficult to ascertain because chronic diseases develop over relatively long periods of time and are influenced by many factors other than stress. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that stress plays a role in the development of several types of chronic health problems—including [[cardiovascular disease]], [[musculoskeletal disorders]], and [[psychological disorders]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Job stress and strain has been associated with poor mental health and wellbeing over a 12-year period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Occupational stress has negative effects for organizations and employers. Occupational stress is the cause of approximately 40% of turnover and 50% of workplace absences. The annual cost of occupational stress and its effects in the US is estimated to be over $60 billion to employers and $250–300 billion to the economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Prevention==
A combination of organizational change and stress management is often the most useful approach for preventing stress at work.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_Stressatwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both organizations and employees can employ strategies at organizational and individual levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, organizational level strategies include job procedure modification and employee assistance programs (EAP). Individual level strategies include taking vacation. Getting a realistic job preview to understand the normal workload and schedules of the job will also help people to identify whether or not the job fit them.

How an Organization Can Prevent Job Stress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sauter |first1=Steven L. |last2=Murphy |first2=Lawrence R. |last3=Hurrell |first3=Joseph J. |title=Prevention of work-related psychological disorders: A national strategy proposed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1146–58 |year=1990 |pmid=2252233 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.45.10.1146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ensure that the workload is in line with workers' capabilities and resources.
* Design jobs to provide meaning, stimulation, and opportunities for workers to use their skills.
* Clearly define workers' roles and responsibilities.
* To reduce workplace stress, managers may monitor the workload given out to the employees. Also while they are being trained they should let employees understand and be notified of stress awareness.&lt;ref&gt;WORKPLACE STRESS: Show your commitment. (2008). Employee Benefits, (13668722), S.13-S.13. http://search.proquest.com/docview/224697345&lt;/ref&gt;
* Give workers opportunities to participate in decisions and actions affecting their jobs.
* Improve communications-reduce uncertainty about career development and future employment prospects.
* Provide opportunities for social interaction among workers.
* Establish work schedules that are compatible with demands and responsibilities outside the job.
* Combat workplace [[discrimination]] (based on race, gender, national origin, religion or language).
* Bringing in an objective outsider such as a consultant to suggest a fresh approach to persistent problems.&lt;ref name="BittelLester"&gt;Bittel, Lester R. Management Skills for Success. [[Alexander Hamilton Institute]] Incorporated, 1984. Print.{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Introducing a participative leadership style to involve as many subordinates as possible to resolve stress-producing problems.&lt;ref name="BittelLester" /&gt;
* Encourage work-life balance through family-friendly benefits and policies

An insurance company conducted several studies on the effects of stress prevention programs in hospital settings. Program activities included (1) employee and management education on job stress, (2) changes in hospital policies and procedures to reduce organizational sources of stress, and (3) the establishment of employee assistance programs. In one study, the frequency of [[medication errors]] declined by 50% after prevention activities were implemented in a 700-bed hospital. In a second study, there was a 70% reduction in [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] claims in 22 hospitals that implemented stress prevention activities. In contrast, there was no reduction in claims in a matched group of 22 hospitals that did not implement stress prevention activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=John W. |last2=Barge |first2=Bruce N. |last3=Steffy |first3=Brian D. |last4=Fay |first4=Lisa M. |last5=Kunz |first5=Lisa K. |last6=Wuebker |first6=Lisa J. |title=Stress and medical malpractice: Organizational risk assessment and intervention |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=727–35 |year=1988 |pmid=3209582 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.73.4.727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Telecommuting]] is another way organizations can help reduce stress for their workers. Employees defined telecommuting as "an alternative work arrangement in which employees perform tasks elsewhere that are normally done in a primary or central workplace, for at least some portion of their work schedule, using electronic media to interact with others inside and outside the organization." One reason that telecommuting gets such high marks is that it allows employees more control over how they do their work. Telecommuters reported more job satisfaction and less desire to find a new job. Employees that worked from home also had less stress, improved work/life balance and higher performance rating by their managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajendran |first1=Ravi |last2=Harrison |first2=David |title=Telecommuting Win-Win For Employees And Employers |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=1524–41 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1524|pmid=18020794 |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review of stress-reduction techniques among healthcare workers found that cognitive behavioral training lowered emotional exhaustion and feelings of lack of personal accomplishment.&lt;ref name="pmid18728906"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruotsalainen J, Serra C, Marine A, Verbeek J | title = Systematic review of interventions for reducing occupational stress in health care workers | journal = Scand J Work Environ Health | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–78 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18728906 | doi = 10.5271/sjweh.1240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both yoga and mindful-based stress reduction have been shown to reduce work-related stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Yoga for stress reduction and injury prevention at work|journal = Work (Reading, Mass.)|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 1051-9815|pmid = 12454346|pages = 3–7|volume = 19|issue = 1|first = Shira Taylor|last = Gura}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Stress Management in Healthy People: A Review and Meta-Analysis|journal = The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 1075-5535|pages = 593–600|volume = 15|issue = 5|doi = 10.1089/acm.2008.0495|pmid = 19432513|first = Alberto|last = Chiesa|first2 = Alessandro|last2 = Serretti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses who participated in cognitive behavioral interventions had less perceived stress, a greater sense of coherence, and increased mood.

'''Expanding research on stress''': Contemporary opinions hold that jobs designed to support skill variety, task identity, significance, autonomy, and feedback, while providing for existence and growth needs, will sustain a healthier, greater satisfied workforce.

For team-oriented work environments, Patrick Lencioni's ''The Five Dysfunctions of a Team''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Five Dysfunctions of a Team|last = Lencioni|first = Patrick|publisher = Jossey-Bass|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0787960759|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; profiles the behavior of cohesive teams:

* They trust one another.
* They engage in unfiltered conflict around ideas.
* They commit to decisions and plans of action.
* They hold one another accountable for delivering against those plans.
* They focus on the achievement of collective results.

For immediate individual stress management, rudimentary mental coping strategies may be adopted in the work environment.

Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26878/|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[glycolipid]]s have an important role in the immune response.

They are normally present as [[glycan]]s: oligosaccharide chains linked to [[lipid]]s or to compatible [[amino acid]] side chains in [[protein]]s, by ''N''- or ''O''-[[glycoside|glygosidic bonds]]. N-linked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Voet | first1 = Donald | last2 = Voet | first2 = Judith | last3 = Pratt | first3 = Charlotte | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level | edition = 4th | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | isbn = 978-0470-54784-7 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, [[O-linked glycosylation|O-linked]] oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain. Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids.  Some, such as the [[raffinose]] series, occur as storage or transport [[carbohydrates]] in plants.  Others, such as [[maltodextrin]]s or [[cellodextrins]], result from the microbial breakdown of larger [[polysaccharides]] such as [[starch]] or [[cellulose]].

==Glycosylation==
In biology, [[glycosylation]] is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to an organic molecule, creating structures such as glycoproteins and glycolipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===N-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:N Linked Oligosh.png|thumb|An example of N-linked oligosaccharide, shown here with GlcNAc. X is any amino acid except proline.]]
N-linked glycosylation involves oligosaccharide attachment to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; The process of N-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, or concurrently while the proteins is being translated. Since it is added cotranslationally, it is believed that N-linked glycosylation helps determine the folding of polypeptides due to the hydrophilic nature of sugars. All N-linked Oligosaccharides are pentasaccharides: five monosaccharides long.

In [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycosylation]] for eukaryotes, the oligosaccharide substrate is assembled right at the membrane of the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmatic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz F, Aebi M | title = Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 576–82 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21978957 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[prokaryote]]s, this process occurs at the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]]. In both cases, the acceptor substrate is an [[asparagine]] residue. The asparagine residue linked to an N-linked oligosaccharide usually occurs in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr,&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; where X can be any amino acid except for [[proline]], although it is rare to see Asp, Glu, Leu, or Trp in this position.

===O-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:Oolinked Oligosaccharide.png|thumb|An example of O-Linked oligosaccharide with β-Galactosyl-(1n3)-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-Ser/ Thr.]]
Oligosaccharides that participate in O-linked glycosylation are attached to [[threonine]] or [[serine]] on the [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl group]] of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; O-linked glycosylation occurs in the [[golgi apparatus]], where monosaccharide units are added to a complete polypeptide chain. Cell surface proteins and extracellular proteins are O-glycosylated.&lt;ref name="Peter-Katalinić_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peter-Katalinić J | title = Methods in enzymology: O-glycosylation of proteins | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 405 | issue = | pages = 139–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16413314 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(05)05007-X | isbn = 978-0-12-182810-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycosylation sites in O-linked oligosaccharides are determined by the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structures]] of the polypeptide, which dictate where [[Glycosyltransferase|glycosyltransferases]] will add sugars.

==Glycosylated biomolecules==
Glycoproteins and glycolipids are by definition [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to carbohydrates. They are very abundant on the surface of the cell, and their interactions contribute to the overall stability of the cell.

===Glycoproteins===
[[Glycoprotein]]s have distinct Oligosaccharide structures which have significant effects on many of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goochee CF | title = Bioprocess factors affecting glycoprotein oligosaccharide structure | journal = Developments in Biological Standardization | volume = 76 | pages = 95–104 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1478360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting critical functions such as [[antigenicity]], [[solubility]], and resistance to [[protease]]s. Glycoproteins are relevant as [[Cell surface receptor|cell-surface receptors]], cell-adhesion molecules, [[immunoglobulins]], and tumor antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elbein AD | title = The role of N-linked oligosaccharides in glycoprotein function | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 346–52 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1367760 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7799(91)90117-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycolipids===
[[Glycolipid]]s are important for cell recognition, and are important for modulating the function of membrane proteins that act as receptors.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manna M, Róg T, Vattulainen I | title = The challenges of understanding glycolipid functions: An open outlook based on molecular simulations | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1841 | issue = 8 | pages = 1130–45 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24406903 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.12.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolipids are lipid molecules bound to oligosaccharides, generally present in the [[lipid bilayer]]. Additionally, they can serve as receptors for cellular recognition and cell signaling.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014" /&gt; The head of the oligosaccharide serves as a binding partner in [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activity. The binding mechanisms of receptors to the oligosaccharides depends on the composition of the oligosaccharides that are exposed or presented above the surface of the membrane. There is great diversity in the binding mechanisms of glycolipids, which is what makes them such an important target for pathogens as a site for interaction and entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fantini J | title = Interaction of proteins with lipid rafts through glycolipid-binding domains: biochemical background and potential therapeutic applications | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 27 | pages = 2911–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18045136 | doi = 10.2174/092986707782360033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] activity of glycolipids has been studied for its relevance to HIV infection.

==Functions==
===Cell Recognition===
All cells are coated in either glycoproteins or glycolipids, both of which help determine cell types.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; [[Lectin]]s, or proteins that bind carbohydrates, can recognize specific oligosaccharides and provide useful information for cell recognition based on oligosaccharide binding.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

An important example of oligosaccharide cell recognition is the role of glycolipids in determining [[blood type]]s. The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kailemia MJ, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB, Amster IJ | title = Oligosaccharide analysis by mass spectrometry: a review of recent developments | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 196–212 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24313268 | pmc = 3924431 | doi = 10.1021/ac403969n }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be visualized using mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharides found on the A, B, and H [[antigen]] occur on the [[Non-reducing sugar|non-reducing]] ends of the oligosaccharide. The H antigen (which indicates an O blood type) serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; Therefore, a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and H antigen present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane. A person with B blood type will have the B and H antigen present. A person with AB blood type will have A, B, and H antigens present. And finally, a person with O blood type will only have the H antigen present. This means all blood types have the H antigen, which explains why the O blood type is known as the "universal donor".{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Cell Adhesion===
Many cells produce specific carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins, which mediate cell adhesion with oligosaccharides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0959-440X(93)90053-N |title=Oligosaccharides that mediate mammalian cell-cell adhesion |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=701–10 |year=1993 |last1=Feizi |first1=Ten | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selectin]]s - a family of lectins - mediate certain cell-cell adhesion processes, including those of leukocytes to endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; In an immune response, endothelial cells can express certain selectins transiently in response to damage or injury to the cells. In response, a reciprocal selectin-oligosaccharide interaction will occur between the two molecules which allows the white blood cell to help eliminate the infection or damage. Protein-Carbohydrate bonding is often mediated by [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonding]] and [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals forces]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Dietary oligosaccharides==
[[Fructooligosaccharide|Fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS), which are found in many vegetables, are short chains of [[fructose]] molecules. They differ from [[inulin]], which has a much higher [[degree of polymerization]] than FOS and is therefore a polysaccharide, but like inulin, they are considered soluble dietary fibre. [[Galactooligosaccharides]] (GOS), which also occur naturally, consist of short chains of [[galactose]] molecules. These compounds cannot be digested in the human small intestine, and instead pass through to the large intestine, where they promote the growth of ''[[Bifidobacterium|Bifidobacteria]]'', which are beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=0oE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58| title = The Gut Microbiome: Exploring the Connection between Microbes, Diet, and Health | last = Moise | first = Ana Maria R. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2017-10-31 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year=|isbn=978-1-4408-4265-8|location=|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mannan Oligosaccharide based nutritional supplements (MOS)|Mannan oligosaccharides]] (MOS) are widely used in [[compound feed|animal feed]] to improve gastrointestinal health. They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. Mannan oligosaccharides differ from other oligosaccharides in that they are not fermentable and their primary mode of actions include agglutination of type-1 fimbria pathogens and immunomodulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smiricky-Tjardes MR, Flickinger EA, Grieshop CM, Bauer LL, Murphy MR, Fahey GC | title = In vitro fermentation characteristics of selected oligosaccharides by swine fecal microflora | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 2505–14 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14552378 | doi = 10.2527/2003.81102505x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Oligosaccharides are a component of [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] from plant tissue. FOS and inulin are present in [[Jerusalem artichoke]], [[burdock]], [[chicory]], [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[asparagus]]. Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world’s population. FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' acting on [[sucrose]]. GOS is naturally found in [[soybeans]] and can be synthesized from [[lactose]]. FOS, GOS, and inulin are also sold as nutritional supplements.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

One author describes the syndromes of chronic testicular pain thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The complaint is of a squeezing deep ache in the testis like the day after you got kicked there, often bilateral or alternating from one side to the other, intermittent, and, most commonly, associated with lower back pain.  Sometimes it feels like the testicle is pinched in the crotch of the underwear but trouser readjustment does not help.  There may also be pain in the [[Inguinal canal|inguinal]] area but no nausea or other symptoms.  Back pain may be concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain.  Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects.  Other stresses that might cause low back pain are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture that flattens the normal lumbar [[lordosis]] curve."&lt;ref name=baran&gt;{{Cite book

'''Parenteral nutrition''' ('''PN''') is the feeding of specialist nutritional products to a person [[intravenous]]ly, bypassing the usual process of [[eating]] and [[digestion]]. The products are made by specialist pharmaceutical compounding companies and is considered to be the highest risk pharmaceutical preparation available as the products cannot undergo any form of terminal sterilization. The person receives highly complex nutritional formulae that contain nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[salts]], [[amino acid]]s, [[lipid]]s and added [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral]]s. It is called '''total parenteral nutrition''' ('''TPN''') or '''total nutrient admixture''' ('''TNA''') when no significant nutrition is obtained by other routes, and '''partial parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when nutrition is also partially [[gastrointestinal tract|enteric]]. It may be called '''peripheral parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when administered through [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|vein access in a limb]] rather than through a [[central venous catheter|central vein]] as '''central venous nutrition''' ('''CVN''').

==Medical uses==
Total [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] nutrition (TPN) is provided when the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity (it is blocked, or has a leak - a [[fistula]]) or because its absorptive capacity is impaired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kozier, B., &amp; Erb, G., &amp; Berman, A.J., &amp; Burke, K., &amp; Bouchal, S. R., &amp; Hirst, S. P.. (2004). Fundamentals of Nursing: The Nature of Nursing Practice in Canada. Canadian Edition. Prentice Hall Health: Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for [[coma]]tose patients, although [[feeding tube|enteral feeding]] is usually preferable, and less prone to complications. Parenteral nutrition is used to prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or [[enteral]] routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |title=American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement: parenteral nutrition |access-date=2008-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730131405/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |archive-date=2007-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends waiting until hospital day number seven.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Absolute indications for TPN:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Van Gossum A, Cabre E, Hebuterne X, Jeppesen P, Krznaric Z, Messing B, Powell-Tuck J, Staun M, Nightingale J. ESPEN Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology. Clinical Nutrition. 2009; (28):415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Short bowel syndrome
* Small bowel obstruction
* Active gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pseudo-obstruction with complete intolerance to food
* High-output (defined as &gt; 500ml/day) enteric-cutaneous fistulas (unless a feeding tube can be passed distal to the fistula)

===Gastrointestinal disorders===
TPN may be the only feasible option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest, including [[bowel obstruction]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual"&gt;The Merck Manual, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[short bowel syndrome]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; [[gastroschisis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; prolonged [[diarrhea]] regardless of its cause,&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; very severe [[Crohn's disease]]&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; or [[ulcerative colitis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]].&lt;ref name="Heird"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heird|first=WC|author2=Gomez, MR|title=Total parenteral nutrition in necrotizing enterocolitis.|journal=Clinics in Perinatology|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=2|pages=389–409|pmid=8070233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cancer===
The benefit of TPN to [[cancer]] patients is largely debated, and studies to date have generally showed minimal long term benefit.

==Duration==
Short-term PN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by [[peritonitis]]), and they are at a low enough weight to cause concerns about nutrition during an extended hospital stay. Long-term PN is occasionally used to treat people suffering the extended consequences of an accident, surgery, or digestive disorder. PN has extended the life of children born with nonexistent or severely deformed organs.

===Living with TPN===
Approximately 40,000 people use TPN at home in the United States, and because TPN requires anywhere from 10–16 hours to be administered, daily life can be affected.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaworski|first=J.A.|title=Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.chp.edu/CHP/faq+about+tpn+intestine|publisher=Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although daily lifestyle can be changed, most patients agree that these changes are better than staying at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "Daisy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at home|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-conditions/search-for-medical-conditions/costello-syndrome/living-with-total-parenteral-nutrition-tpn-at-home/|publisher=Great Ormund Street Hospital for Children|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different types of pumps exist to limit the time the patient is “hooked-up”. Usually a backpack pump is used, allowing for mobility. The time required to be connected to the IV is dependent on the situation of each patient; some require once a day, or five days a week.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

It is important for patients to avoid as much TPN related change as possible in their lifestyles. This allows for the best possible mental health situation; constantly being held down can lead to resentment and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. [[Physical activity]] is also highly encouraged, but patients must avoid contact sports (equipment damage) and swimming (infection). Many [[teens]] find it difficult to live with TPN due to issues regarding [[body image]] and not being able to participate in activities and events.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

==Complications==
TPN fully bypasses the GI tract and normal methods of nutrient absorption. Possible complications, which may be significant, are listed below. Other than those listed below, other common complications of TPN include hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypercapnia, decreased copper and zinc levels, elevated prothrombin time (if associated with liver injury), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and decreased gastrointestinal motility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Infection===
TPN requires a chronic IV access for the solution to run through, and the most common complication is infection of this catheter. Infection is a common cause of death in these patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 15% per infection, and death usually results from [[septic shock]].&lt;ref name=Deshpande&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deshpande|first=KS|title=Total parenteral nutrition and infections associated with use of central venous catheters.|journal=American Journal of Critical Care|date=July 2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=326–7, 380|pmid=12882062|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/12/4/326.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using central venous access, the subclavian (or axillary) vein is preferred due to its ease of access and lowest infectious complications compared to the jugular and femoral vein insertions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Blood clots===
Chronic IV access leaves a foreign body in the vascular system, and blood clots on this IV line are common.&lt;ref name=Mollitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mollitt|first=DL|author2=Golladay ES.|title=Complications of TPN catheter-induced vena caval thrombosis in children less than one year of age|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|date=August 1983|volume=18|issue=4|pages=462–7|pmid=6413671|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346883802012|doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(83)80201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Death can result from [[pulmonary embolism]] wherein a clot that starts on the IV line breaks off and travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow.&lt;ref name=Mailloux&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=RJ|author2=DeLegge, MH |author3=Kirby, DF |title=Pulmonary embolism as a complication of long-term total parenteral nutrition|journal=JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition|date=Nov–Dec 1993|volume=17|issue=6|pages=578–82|pmid=8301814|doi=10.1177/0148607193017006578}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Periportal hepatosteatosis intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[liver lobule|periportal]] [[fatty liver]] as may arise due to '''TPN'''. [[Trichrome stain]].]]

Patients on TPN who have such clots occluding their catheter may receive a [[thrombolytic]] flush to dissolve the clots and prevent further complications.

===Fatty liver and liver failure===
Fatty liver is usually a more long term complication of TPN, though over a long enough course it is fairly common. The pathogenesis is due to using linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid component of soybean oil) as a major source of calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of OMEGAVEN 10%® (n-3 EFA Lipid Emulsion) in Home Parenteral Nutrition-associated Liver Disease (MEGANORM)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01284049|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper|first=SN|author2=Rohm KD|title=Hepatocellular integrity after parenteral nutrition: comparison of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion with an olive-soybean oil-based lipid emulsion|journal=Eur J Anaesthesiol.|date=Dec 2009|pmid=19916246|doi=10.1097/EJA.0b013e32832e08e0|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1076–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; TPN-associated liver disease strikes up to 50% of patients within 5–7 years, correlated with a mortality rate of 2–50%. Onset of this liver disease is the major complication that leads TPN patients to requiring an [[intestine transplantation|intestinal transplant]].&lt;ref name="Garg et al., 2011"&gt;Garg, M. Jones, R. M., Vaughan, R. B., Testro, A. G. (2011). Intestinal transplantation: Current status and future directions. Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 26, 1221-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipid emulsion|Intralipid]] ([[Fresenius (company)|Fresenius-Kabi]]), the US standard lipid emulsion for TPN nutrition, contains a 7:1 ratio of n-6/n-3 ratio of [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA). By contrast, [[Omegaven]] has a 1:8 ratio and showed promise in multiple clinical studies. Therefore n-3-rich fat may alter the course of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Jain|first=Ajay|last2=Teckman|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=2014|title=Newly Identified Mechanisms of Total Parenteral Nutrition Related Liver Injury|url=http://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/621380/|journal=Advances in Hepatology|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2014/621380|issn=2356-6744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunger===
Because patients are being fed intravenously, the subject does not physically eat, resulting in intense [[hunger pang]]s (pains). The brain uses signals from the [[mouth]] ([[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]]), the [[stomach]]/[[gastrointestinal tract]] (fullness) and [[blood]] ([[nutrient]] levels) to determine conscious feelings of [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].&lt;ref name= "Hunger WIKI"&gt;[[Hunger (motivational state)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases of TPN, the taste, smell and physical fullness requirements are not met, and so the patient experiences hunger, despite the fact that the body is being fully nourished.

Patients who eat food despite the inability can experience a wide range of complications.&lt;ref name= "bowel obst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowel Obstruction|url=http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/bowel-obstruction|publisher=Women's Health|accessdate=30 March 2014|date=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cholecystitis ===
Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute [[cholecystitis]]&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=RA|title=Acalculous cholecystitis and fever related to total parenteral nutrition|pmid=6437783|year=1984|last2=Jenkins|first2=HL|volume=18|issue=11|pages=897–9|journal=Drug Intelligence &amp; Clinical Pharmacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  due to complete disuse of gastrointestinal tract, which may result in bile stasis in the [[gallbladder]]. Other potential [[hepatobiliary dysfunction]]s include [[steatosis]],&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=H|author2=Khaoustov, VI |author3=Krishnan, B |author4=Cai, W |author5=Stoll, B |author6=Burrin, DG |author7= Yoffe, B |title=Total parenteral nutrition induces liver steatosis and apoptosis in neonatal piglets|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=October 2006|volume=136|issue=10|pages=2547–52|pmid=16988124|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/10/2547.short|doi=10.1093/jn/136.10.2547}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[steatohepatitis]], [[cholestasis]], and [[cholelithiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quigley EM, Marsh MN, Shaffer JL, Markin RS |title=Hepatobiliary complications of total parenteral nutrition |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=286–301 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8419252 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six percent of patients on TPN longer than 3 weeks and 100% of patients on TPN longer than 13 weeks develop [[biliary sludge]].  The formation of sludge is the result of stasis due to lack of enteric stimulation and is not due to changes in bile composition. Gallbladder sludge disappears after 4 weeks of normal oral diet.  Administration of exogenous [[cholecystokinin|cholecystokinin (CCK)]] or stimulation of endogenous CCK by periodic pulse of large amounts of amino acids have been shown to help prevent sludge formation. These therapies are not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910002340/http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such complications are suggested to be the main reason for mortality in people requiring long-term total parenteral nutrition, such as in [[short bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Vanderhoof&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanderhoof JA, Langnas AN |title=Short-bowel syndrome in children and adults |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=1767–78 |year=1997 |pmid=9352883 |doi=10.1053/gast.1997.v113.pm9352883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newborn infants with short bowel syndrome with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, thereby being dependent upon total parenteral nutrition, 5 year survival is approximately 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Spencer AU, Neaga A, West B, etal |title=Pediatric short bowel syndrome: redefining predictors of success |journal=Ann.

=== Other complications ===
Other complications are either related to catheter insertion, or metabolic, including [[refeeding syndrome]]. Catheter complications include [[pneumothorax]], accidental arterial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The complication rate at the time of insertion should be less than 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGee DC, Gould MK |title=Preventing complications of central venous catheterization |journal=N.

|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolic complications include the refeeding syndrome characterised by [[hypokalemia]], [[hypophosphatemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]]. [[Hyperglycemia]] is common at the start of therapy, but can be treated with insulin added to the TPN solution. Hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Liver dysfunction can be limited to a reversible cholestatic jaundice and to fatty infiltration (demonstrated by elevated transaminases). Severe hepatic dysfunction is a rare complication.&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward Morgan, Jr., Maged S. Mikhail, Michael J. MurrayClinical Anesthesiology, 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, patients receiving TPN have a higher rate of infectious complications. This can be related to hyperglycemia.&lt;ref name=McCowen&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hypocaloric total parenteral nutrition: effectiveness in prevention of hyperglycemia and infectious complications--a randomized clinical trial|pmid=11098961|url=http://pdfs.journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/2000/11000/00007.pdf|year=2000|last1=McCowen|first1=KC|last2=Friel|first2=C|last3=Sternberg|first3=J|last4=Chan|first4=S|last5=Forse|first5=RA|last6=Burke|first6=PA|last7=Bistrian|first7=BR|volume=28|issue=11|pages=3606–11|journal=Critical Care Medicine|doi=10.1097/00003246-200011000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
[[Pregnancy]] can cause major complications when trying to properly dose the nutrient mixture. Because all of the baby’s nourishment comes from the mother’s blood stream, the doctor must properly calculate the dosage of nutrients to meet both recipients’ needs and have them in usable forms. Incorrect dosage can lead to many adverse, hard-to-guess effects, such as [[death]], and varying degrees of [[deformity|deformation]] or other [[Intellectual disability|developmental problems]].&lt;ref name= "Landon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landon|first1=MB|last2=Gabbe|first2=SG|last3=Mullen|first3=JL|title=Total parenteral nutrition during pregnancy.|journal=Clin Perinatol|year=1986|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–72|pmid=3082563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that parenteral nutrition administration begin after a period of natural nutrition so doctors can properly calculate the nutritional needs of the [[fetus]]. Otherwise, it should only be administered by a team of highly skilled doctors who can accurately assess the fetus’ needs.&lt;ref name= "Landon" /&gt;

==Total parenteral nutrition==
[[File:LipidHPN.jpg|thumb|right | Prescription lipid parenteral nutrition formulation]]
Solutions for total parenteral nutrition may be customized to individual patient requirements, or standardized solutions may be used. The use of standardized parenteral nutrition solutions is cost effective and may provide better control of serum electrolytes.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=EM|author2=Cohen KR|author3=Pinard BE|author4=Lauletta J|author5=Ruggiero R.|title=Standardized versusindividually customized parenteral nutrition solutions: a comparison ofserum electrolyte values|journal=P&amp;T|year=2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=78–80, 83, 87|url=http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|access-date=2010-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715130250/http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ideally each patient is assessed individually before commencing on parenteral nutrition, and a team consisting of specialised doctors, nurses, [[clinical pharmacist]]s and [[Registered Dietitian|registered dietitian]]s evaluate the patient's individual data and decide what PN formula to use and at what infusion rate.

For energy only, [[intravenous sugar solution]]s with [[dextrose]] or [[glucose]] are generally used. This is not considered to be parenteral nutrition as it does not prevent malnutrition when used on its own. Standardized solutions may also differ between developers. Following are some examples of what compositions they may have. The solution for normal patients may be given both centrally and peripherally.

==Components==

===Prepared solutions===
Prepared solutions generally consist of [[water]] and electrolytes; [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, and lipids; essential [[vitamin]]s, minerals and trace elements are added or given separately. Previously lipid emulsions were given separately but it is becoming more common for a "three-in-one" solution of glucose, proteins, and lipids to be administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Didier ME, Fischer S, Maki DG |title=Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=291–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9739032

===Added components===
Individual nutrient components may be added to more precisely adjust the body contents of it. That individual nutrient may, if possible, be infused individually, or it may be injected into a bag of nutrient solution or intravenous fluids ([[volume expander]] solution) that is given to the patient.

Administration of individual components may be more hazardous than administration of pre-mixed solutions such as those used in total parenteral nutrition, because the latter are generally already balanced in regard to e.g. osmolarity and ability to infuse peripherally. Incorrect IV administration of concentrated [[Potassium#In diet|potassium]] can be lethal, but this is not a danger if the potassium is mixed in TPN solution and diluted.&lt;ref name=RNSH&gt;[http://www.ciap.health.nsw.gov.au/nswtag/publications/guidelines/Postassium/RNSHRyde.pdf Intravenous Potassium Guidelines (ADULTS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224050743/http://www.ciap.health.nsw.gov.au/nswtag/publications/guidelines/Postassium/RNSHRyde.pdf |date=2011-02-24 }} From RNSH Pharmacy Department. Authorised by: Margaret Duguid. Last Modified: June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamins may be added to a bulk premixed nutrient immediately before administration, since the additional vitamins can promote spoilage of stored product.{{citation needed | reason= need studies that how stability with and without added vitamins |date=January 2016}} Vitamins can be added in two doses, one fat-soluble, the other water-soluble. {{anchor|Cernevit}}There are also single-dose preparations with both fat- and water-soluble vitamins such as ''Cernevit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/1999/20924lbl.pdf|title=Cernevit™-12 (multivitamins for infusion)|website=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[NPS MedicineWise]]|url=http://www.nps.org.au/__data/cmi_pdfs/CMR03211.pdf|title=Cernevit|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|minerals}}Minerals and trace elements for parenteral nutrition are available in prepared mixtures, such as ''Addaven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbase.de//de/datenbanken/abda-datenbank/aktuelle-infos/artikel.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2174555&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=115&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bback_link%5D=yes&amp;cHash=e7f22d012a12142d6cab1215df22b24f|title=Addaven Konzentrat zur Herstellung einer Infusionslösung|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft Stuttgart|date=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emulsifier===
Only a limited number of emulsifiers are commonly regarded as safe to use for parenteral administration, of which the most important is [[lecithin]].{{medcn|date=May 2013}} Lecithin can be biodegraded and metabolized, since it is an integral part of biological membranes, making it virtually non-toxic. Other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} creating a toxic load. The emulsifier of choice for most fat emulsions used for parenteral nutrition is a highly purified egg lecithin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.chemie.uni-erlangen.de/services/dissonline/data/dissertation/Christoph_Wabel/html/Chapter1.html Lecithin - An Emulsifier for Parenteral Use: TORVS Research Team]&lt;/ref&gt; due to its low toxicity and complete integration with cell membranes.

Use of egg-derived emulsifiers is not recommended for people with an egg allergy due to the risk of reaction. In situations where there is no suitable emulsifying agent for a person at risk of developing essential fatty acid deficiency, cooking oils may be spread upon large portions of available skin for supplementation by transdermal absorption.

Another type of fat emulsion [[Omegaven]] is being used experimentally within the US primarily in the pediatric population. It is made of fish oil instead of the egg based formulas more widely in use. Research has shown use of Omegaven may reverse and prevent liver disease and cholestasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21448206 | doi=10.1038/jp.2010.182 | volume=31 Suppl 1 | title=The use of Omegaven in treating parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease | year=2011 | journal=J Perinatol | pages=S57–60| last1=Park | first1=K.

==History==
{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2014}}
Developed in the 1960s by Dr. Stanley J. Dudrick, who as a surgical resident in the University of Pennsylvania, working in the basic science laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Rhoads, was the first to successfully nourish initially Beagle puppies and subsequently newborn babies with catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilmore DW, Groff DB, Bishop HC, Dudrick SJ | date = Apr 1969 | title = Total parenteral nutrition in infants with catastrophic gastrointestinal anomalies | url = | journal = J Pediatr Surg | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 181–9 | pmid = 4976039 | doi=10.1016/0022-3468(69)90389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dudrick collaborated with Dr. Willmore and Dr. Vars to complete the work necessary to make this nutritional technique safe and successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dudrick SJ, Wilmore DW, Vars HM, Rhoads JE | date = Jul 1968 | title = Long-term total parenteral nutrition with growth, development, and positive nitrogen balance | url = | journal = Surgery | volume = 64 | issue = 1| pages = 134–42 | pmid = 4968812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the term "patient participation" has been used in many different contexts. These include, for example: '''participatory medicine''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=Esther|title=Why Participatory Medicine?|journal=Journal of Participatory Medicine|date=21 October 2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=e1 |url=http://www.jopm.org/opinion/editorials/2009/10/21/why-participatory-medicine/|issn=2152-7202}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''health consumerism''',&lt;ref name="Robinson2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=James C. |title=Managed Consumerism In Health Care|journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |date=December 2005 |pages=1478–89 |issn=0278-2715 |pmid=16284020 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1478 |doi-access=free |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/6/1478.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and '''patient-centered care'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=|title=Declaration on: Patient-Centered Healthcare|url=https://www.iapo.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/IAPO_declaration_ENG_2016.pdf|publisher=International Alliance of Patients' Organizations|accessdate=30 June 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=QualityChasm|Patient-centered care especially has been subject to reinterpretation since 2001, when the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) defined patient-centered care as "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Institute of Medicine]] |date=2001 |chapter=Executive Summary |title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10027/chapter/2 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10027/crossing-the-quality-chasm-a-new-health-system-for-the |isbn=978-0-309-07280-9 |doi=10.17226/10027 |doi-access=free |page=[http://www.nap.edu/read/10027/page/6 6] |via=National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} For the latter context, i.e. patient-centered care, a more nuanced definition was proposed in 2009 by the president of the [[Institute for Healthcare Improvement]] [[Donald Berwick]]: "The experience (to the extent the informed, individual patient desires it) of transparency, individualization, recognition, respect, dignity, and choice in all matters, without exception, related to one's person, circumstances, and relationships in health care"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berwick |first=Donald M. |author-link=Donald Berwick |date=July 2009 |title=What Patient-Centered Should Mean: Confessions of an Extremist |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=w555-65 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.w555 |doi-access=free |pmid=19454528 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/4/w555.full |access-date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concepts closely related to patient participation. In the UK over the course of 2016 two new relevant terms have expanded in usage: [[Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)]] and Engagement (PPIE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[National Institute for Health Research]] |title=Is 2017 the year for PPIE? |date=23 February 2017

Patient participation is a generic term, and thus no list can be exhaustive; nonetheless, the following description shall subdivide it into several areas where patients and/or their advocates have a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelty |first1=C |last2= Panofsky|first2=A |last3= Currie|first3= M | last4= Crooks| first4= R| last5=Erickson | first5=S |last6= Garcia| first6=P | last7= Wartenbe | first7= M |last8= Wood |first8=S |date=2015 |title=Seven dimensions of contemporary participation disentangled |journal= [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]] |volume=66 |pages=474–488 |doi=10.1002/asi.23202 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262679683_Seven_Dimensions_of_Contemporary_Participation_Disentangled |access-date= May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of health policy as stakeholders==

Patient participation, as it pertains to the formation of health policy, is a process that involves patients as [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], advisors and shared decision makers. The practice of engaging patients in health  policy originated from the [[consumer advocacy]] movement, which prioritized consumer safety, access to information and public participation in public health programs.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souliotis|first=Kyriakos|last2=Agapidaki|first2=Eirini|last3=Peppou|first3=Lily Evangelia|date=September 2017|title=Assessing Patient Organization Participation in Health Policy: A Comparative Study in France and Italy|url=http://ijhpm.com/article_3351_82d9af675fe60fb81f41a8bd9d62027a.pdf|journal=International Journal of Health Policy Management|volume=6(x)|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the context, patient participation in health policy can refer to informed decision making, health advocacy, program development, policy implementation, and evaluation of services.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Patient participation in health policy can affect many different levels of the health care system. Hospitalized individuals may participate in their own medical care in an effort to make shared decisions. In other areas, patients act as advocates by serving as members of organizational and governmental policy committees.

Increased patient participation in health policy can lead to improvements in patient satisfaction, quality and safety, cost savings and population health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carman|first=Kristin L.|last2=Dardess|first2=Pam|last3=Maurer|first3=Maureen|last4=Sofaer|first4=Shoshanna|last5=Adams|first5=Karen|last6=Bechtel|first6=Christine|last7=Sweeney|first7=Jennifer|date=2013-02-01|title=Patient And Family Engagement: A Framework For Understanding The Elements And Developing Interventions And Policies|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/2/223|journal=Health Affairs|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=223–231|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1133|issn=0278-2715|pmid=23381514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involving patient participation in health policy research can also ensure that public health needs are accurately incorporated into policy proposals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souliotis|first=Kyriakos|last2=Agapidaki|first2=Eirini|last3=Peppou|first3=Lily Evangelia|last4=Tzavara|first4=Chara|last5=Samoutis|first5=George|last6=Theodorou|first6=Mamas|date=2016-08-01|title=Assessing Patient Participation in Health Policy Decision-Making in Cyprus|url=http://www.ijhpm.com/article_3227_629.html|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=5|issue=8|pages=461–466|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2016.78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;When solicited for participation by policymakers and industry leaders, patients can influence health policy, and both groups benefit from collaboration on goal setting and outcome measurement. By providing feedback in the form of survey responses, patients give community health officials and hospital leaders helpful feedback on the perceived quality and accessibility of health care services. Furthermore, patient satisfaction scores from these surveys have become an important metric by which hospitals are evaluated and compared to one another.

Patient participation has driven the development of a variety of health policies, ranging from the expansion of hospital visitation hours to the implementation of patient-centered bedside rounding by hospital medical teams. Patient participation has contributed to improvements in the nurse-to-nurse handoff process by engaging with staff to discuss change-of-shift information at the patient's bedside. Patient participation in care coordination has also lead to the utilization of electronic medical records that patients can access and edit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;By engaging with patients and patient advocacy groups, policymakers can support patients to shape public policy. Examples include facilitation of public participation in research, town hall meetings, public information sessions, internet and mobile-based surveys and open comment periods on proposed legislation. Hospitals promote patient participation by empowering patients to serve as advisers and decision makers, including on quality improvement teams, patient safety committees, and family-centered care councils.&amp;nbsp;Similarly, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies can create funding mechanisms requiring and supporting patient participation in societal decisions and priority setting. 

Some aspects of PPI have been seen critically; in addition to those under HTA below, examples of general critical voices include a group of U.S. researchers presenting a framework in 2013 and a young Canadian speaker in 2018. The former warn that clinicians, delivery systems, and policy makers cannot assume that patients have certain capabilities, interests, or goals, nor can they dictate the pathway to achieving a patient's goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The latter sees multiple potential conflicts of interest in the current arena of PPI.&lt;ref&gt;Keynote at the [[Cochrane (organisation)]] 2018, Edinburgh, Scotland: {{cite web |title="The trouble with patient and public involvement (PPI)" |date=2018 |url=https://johannesen.ca/2018/09/the-trouble-with-patient-and-public-involvement-ppi-keynote-at-cochrane-colloquium-2018/ |first1= Jennifer|last1= Johanssen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In health technology assessment==

Patient participation in [[health technology assessment]] (HTA) is an approach to HTA which aims to include patients in the process of HTA. It is sometimes called consumer or patient engagement or consumer or patient involvement, although in HTA the latter term has been defined to include research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences as well as participation per se.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334e340 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1017/S0266462310000395  | url=  |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo  |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman | first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In HTA, patient participation is also often used to include the participation of patient groups, patient advocates, and patients' families and carers in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&amp;context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö  |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri  |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen|first6= Susan |last6=  Myles |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As HTA aims to help healthcare funders, such as governments, make decisions about [[health policy]], it often involves the question as to whether to use broadly defined health "technologies", and if so, how and when; then patients comprise a key stakeholder in the HTA process. Additionally, because HTA seeks to assess if a heath technology produces useful outcomes for patients in real world settings (clinical effectiveness) that are good value for money (cost effectiveness), understanding patients' needs, preferences and experiences is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334–340 |date=  2010 |doi= 10.1017/S0266462310000395  | url=  |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman |first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When patients take part in HTA, their knowledge gained from living with a condition and using treatments and services can add value to an HTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives can be integrated in health technology assessments: an exploratory analysis of CADTH Common Drug Review|date=  2016 | url=  https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.118/s40900-016-0036-9?site=researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com |first1=Sarah    |last1= Berglas |first2= Lauren   |last2= Jutai  |first3= Gail  |last3=MacKean  |first4=Laura    |last4= Weeks   }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are called experience-based experts or lay experts.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involving patients in health technology funding decisions: stakeholder perspectives on processes used in Australia |date=2015 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hex.12356/pdf |first1= Edilene |last1= Lopes |first2= Jackie |last2= Street |first3= Drew |last3= Carter |first4= Tracy |last4= Merlin |doi=10.1111/hex.12356|pmc=5055264 }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt;
Patients can add value to HTAs by providing real world insights (e.g. implications of benefits and side effects, variation in clinical practice)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  Understanding Health Technology Assessment (HTA) | url= http://img.eurordis.org/newsletter/pdf/nov-2010/58-1%20HEE%20Guide%20To%20HTA%20for%20Patients%20English.pdf |last1= Health Equality Europe (HEE) }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting outcomes that matter, addressing gaps and uncertainties in the published literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involving patients in reducing decision uncertainties around orphan and ultra-orphan drugs: A rare opportunity? | journal= Patient | pages=29–39 |date=  2015 |doi= 10.1007/s40271-014-0106-8 |first1=Devidas    |last1= Menon |first2= Tania   |last2= Stafinski   |first3= A  |last3=Dunn  |first4=H    |last4= Short   | volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives can be integrated in health technology assessments: an exploratory analysis of CADTH Common Drug Review|date=  2016 | url=  https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40900-016-0036-9?site=researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com |first1=Sarah    |last1= Berglas |first2= Lauren   |last2= Jutai   |first3= Gail  |last3=MacKean  |first4=Laura    |last4= Weeks   }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; and contributing to the value construct that shapes assessments and decisions.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

===Approaches===

In 2017, a book was published on patient involvement in HTA (Eds Facey KM, Hansen HP, Single ANV) bringing together research, approaches, methods and case studies prepared by 80 authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811040672|title=Patient Involvement in Health Technology Assessment|editor1=Facey, Karen|editor2=Ploug Hansen, Helle|editor3=Single, Ann|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It demonstrates that practices vary between HTA bodies, and patients can potentially contribute at every stage of an HTA from scoping the questions asked about the health technology, providing input, interpreting the evidence, and drafting and communicating recommendations. It suggests that patient participation in HTA depends on two-way communication and is a dialogue for shared learning and problem solving. The approach taken should be driven by the goal of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Supporting quality public and patient engagement in health system organizations: Development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool | journal= Health expectations | date=  2015 |doi= 10.1111/hex.12378  | first1=Julia    |last1= Abelson |first2= Sarah E   |last2= Boesveld   |first3= Kathy K  |last3=Li | pmc=5152717 | pmid=26113295 | volume=19 | pages=817–27}} {{Open Access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common way that patients take part in HTA is by providing written submissions and participating in expert meetings (for example as an equal member of an expert group or by attending an expert meeting to present information and answer questions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Good Practice Examples of Patient and Public Involvement in Health Technology Assessment  (a living document)| year=2015|last1= Health Technology Assessment international (HTAi)| url= https://www.htai.org/fileadmin/HTAi_Files/ISG/PatientInvolvement/EffectiveInvolvement/Good_Practice_Examples_Feb_2015.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations and criticism ===

Although patient participation has been adopted and developed by a variety of HTA bodies around the world, there are limitations and criticisms of its use. These include concern about how and when to involve patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in health technology assessment in Europe – results of the EPF survey| journal= European Patients Forum |date=  2013 | url=  http://www.eu-patient.eu/globalassets/projects/hta/hta-epf-final-report2013.pdf }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; the burden of participation for patients, representativeness of patients, the potential for conflict of interest (in relation to patient groups receiving funding from manufacturers), and lack of evaluation of patient participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&amp;context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö   |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri   |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen| first6= Susan |last6=  Myles  |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facey et al. (2017) published the book on patient involvement in HTA to establish consistent terminology in the field and demonstrate a range of recognised approaches and methods found in published literature. Authors also highlighted the challenges of evaluation, rapid (short HTAs) and the problem of HTA bodies confusing patient input (information provided by patients and patient groups taking part in HTA) with patient-based evidence (robust research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences). The book itself is not open access, but the lead editor also published a paper on the topic six years before the larger collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in HTA: What added value?|date=2011 |url=https://doi.org/10.3233/PPL-2011-0329 |first1= Karen |last1= Facey|doi=10.3233/PPL-2011-0329}} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of the issues for patient participation in HTA is that HTA has often been constructed as a scientific process which must remain free from the subjective input of patients. 
Likewise, Gauvin et al. report that their "analysis reveals that HTA agencies' role as bridges or boundary organizations situated at the frontier of research and policymaking causes the agencies to struggle with the idea of public involvement" (page 1518).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  ‘It all depends’: Conceptualizing public involvement in the context of health technology assessment agencies | journal= Social Science &amp; Medicine | pages=1518–1526 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.036  | url=  |first1=Francois-Pierre    |last1= Gauvin |first2= Julia   |last2= Abelson   |first3= Mita |last3=Giacomini  |first4=John    |last4= Eyles   |first5= John N. |last5=  Lavis | volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, HTA would be better understood as a policy tool which critically reviews scientific evidence for a local context and this review is shaped by those involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Facey|first=Karen|last2=Boivin|first2=Antoine|last3=Gracia|first3=Javier|last4=Hansen|first4=Helle Ploug|last5=Scalzo|first5=Alessandra Lo|last6=Mossman|first6=Jean|last7=Single|first7=Ann|date=2010|title=Patients' perspectives in health technology assessment: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-technology-assessment-in-health-care/article/patients-perspectives-in-health-technology-assessment-a-route-to-robust-evidence-and-fair-deliberation/3A1AEAFCD140F4D5CAA3694766E0B0FF|journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|volume=26|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1017/s0266462310000395|issn=1471-6348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways that public participation in HTA, including patients, can be implemented. In fact, an entire "typology of issues" has been developed by Gauvin et al., in which each type is "related to the most appropriate public involvement methods". Facey (2017) built on this work in Chapter 5 to describe it in detail for patient participation in HTA.

Sociologist Andrew Webster sees the problem as "a failure to recognise that evaluation is a contested terrain involving different sorts of evidence related to different sorts of context (such as the ''experimental'' derived from clinical trials, ''evidential'', derived from existing clinical practice, and ''experiential'', based on patients' experiences of an intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Andrew: Evaluation, governance and moves to a socially robust assessment of health technology, Working Paper 34, York, 2006, page 8,&lt;/ref&gt;

A further issue for patient participation in HTA is that of the individual versus the group. The HTAi's list available for endorsement on values for patient involvement express this issue as 'involvement ... contributes to equity by seeking to understand the diverse needs of patients with a particular health issue, balanced against the requirements of a health system that seeks to distribute resources fairly amongst all users'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Values and Standards for Patient Involvement in HTA  | url= https://www.htai.org/interest-groups/patient-and-citizen-involvement/pcig-home/values-and-standards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly et al. explain (with their original citations shown here in brackets): "From the moment Archie Cochrane linked questions of clinical effectiveness to cost effectiveness [17] and cost utility analysis was chosen as the basis for assessing value for money, [Evidence-Based Medicine] EBM and HTA have been framed within the utilitarian philosophical tradition. Utilitarianism is premised on the view that actions are good insofar as they maximize benefit for the greatest number [51]. This is not necessarily congruent with what is in the best interest of an individual patient [34]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The importance of values in evidence-based medicine |journal=BMC Medical Ethics |pages=16:69 |date=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 |first1= Michael P. |last1= Kelly| first2=Kelly Iona| last2=Heath | first3 =Jeremy |last3=Howick| first4=Trisha | last4=Greenhalgh| doi=10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | volume=16}} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops in  Denmark  and  Austria  have resulted in calls to action to reinforce patients' role in SDM and health advocacy. The Danish workshop recommended the new Toolbox of resources for patient participation from the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eupati.eu|title=European Patients’ Academy (EUPATI) – Patient education!|website=EUPATI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borup |first1=Gitte  |last2=Friis Bach  |first2= Karin| last3=  Schmiegelow| first3= Merete | last4= Wallach-Kildemoes| first4= Helle| last5=  Jannik Bjerrum| first5=Ole | last6= Westergaard| first6= Niels |  title = A Paradigm Shift Towards Patient Involvement in Medicines Development and Regulatory Science: Workshop Proceedings and Commentary (open access copy) | journal = Therapeutic Innovation &amp; Regulatory Science | volume = 1–8 |date= 2015 | doi = 10.1177/2168479015622668 | subscription= yes | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288888136_A_Paradigm_Shift_Towards_Patient_Involvement_in_Medicines_Development_and_Regulatory_Science_Workshop_Proceedings_and_Commentary?ev=prf_high |ref=harv | pages=304–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the Danish workshop reported that the European Medicines Agency would be "measuring the impact of patient involvement", this being crucial to establishing credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borup|Friis Bach|Schmiegelow|Wallach-Kildemoes|2015|p=5 &amp; note 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed, measurement is provided for in the place cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=European Medicines Agency, Stakeholders and Communication Division  | title =Draft Work plan for the European Medicines Agency Human Scientific Committees' Working Party with Patients' and Consumers' Organisations (PCWP) 2016 |year=2015 | url= https://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Work_programme/2015/12/WC500198775.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, a bibliography ''inter alia'' resulted from the most recent event in a workshop series continuing through 2019 entitled "Toward a Shared Culture of Health: Enriching and Charting the Patient-Clinician Relationship held from 10–16 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.salzburgglobal.org/calendar/2010-2019/2017/session-553.html | title=Session 553: Overview |website=Salzburg Global Seminar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, there is a debate about the relative value of patient participation versus decisions without explicitly empowering patients. Bovenkamp is one of the most vocal opponents challenging patients as stakeholders in clinical guideline development.&lt;ref name="Bovenkamp"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bovenkamp |first1=H.M. |last2=Trappenburg |first2=M.

In Norway, Nilsen et al. were critical of patients' role in health policy and clinical guideline development in their Cochrane Intervention Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nilsen |first1=Elin Strømme |last2= Tinderholdt Myrhaug| first2=Hilde |last3=Oliver |first3= Sandy |last4= Oxman |first4 =Andrew D |title = Methods of consumer involvement in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |page=CD004563  | issue = 3 |date= 2006 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004563.pub2/abstract | doi = 10.1007/s10728-008-0099-3 | volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Norwegian researchers, though, in unison with the workshop findings above, expand the list of areas where patients' views matter: "The central arena for patient participation is the meeting between patient and health professional, but other important areas of involvement include decisions at the system and policy levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Austvoll-Dahlgren |first1= A   |last2= Johansen| first2=M | trans-title = The patient as participant and knowledge manager |title=Pasienten som medvirker og kunnskapshåndterer | journal = Norsk Epidemiologi| volume = 23| issue = 2 | pages= 225–230| date= 2012 |url= https://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/en/publications/the-patient-as-participant-and-knowledge-manager | doi=10.5324/nje.v23i2.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there are several trends emerging with potential international implications: [[Health 2.0]],  [[artificial intelligence in healthcare]] (AI), the role of entrepreneurs, the value of patient participation in precision medicine and mobile health or [[MHealth]], which will be dealt with in greater detail below.

== In shared decision making and artificial intelligence ==
{{See also|Shared decision-making|Artificial intelligence in healthcare}}

Prior to the recent advances in technology, patient participation was limited to&amp;nbsp;[[Shared decision-making in medicine|shared decision making]]&amp;nbsp;(SDM), a form of participation that occurred specifically between a patient and their physician in clinical practice, but can be regarded as a step forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30075-4 |title= Regressing or progressing: what next for the doctor/ patient relationship?

(28 February 2018), pp. 178-180| access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in modern technology now allow computers to play an increasingly important role in healthcare decision making. Examples of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that is being used in healthcare include IBM's Watson Health, which is intended to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of difficult illnesses or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ibm-and-mit-partner-on-240m-ai-lab/504725/|title=IBM and MIT partner on $240M AI lab|work=Healthcare Dive|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;One of the Watson's objectives is to highlighting findings developed by Watson's computing skills and access to everyday information and give concrete suggestions that are tailored to the expertise of the physician, type of ailment, and needed level of care.&amp;nbsp;Physicians can use ailment specific programs such as the Watson for Oncology app, which is aimed at the detection and treatment of tumors. Artificial intelligence is being used more frequently in patient participatory healthcare.

== Role of entrepreneurship ==
Entrepreneurs have led the challenge to conventional health thinking since Craig Venter took on the NIH with the&amp;nbsp;[[1000 Genomes Project]]&amp;nbsp;in 2008. Mike Milken, another entrepreneur and stock trader, founded the Santa Monica, California based Milken Institute. Following the institute's inception, Milken launched the Fastercures program, which "brings together patient advocates, researchers, investors and policymakers from every sector of the medical research and development system to eliminate the roadblocks that get in the way of a faster cure".&amp;nbsp;The Fastercures program proposes patient-center improvements and advancements in the modern healthcare arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/06/16/lessons-from-aidshiv-advocacy-efforts/|title=Lessons From AIDS/HIV Advocacy Efforts|last=Marcus|first=Amy Dockser|date=2011-06-16|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the U.S. Government boosted patient participation by launching its own&amp;nbsp;[[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]]. PCORI is striving to systematize its evaluation metrics to prove where results show improvement.&amp;nbsp;PCORI was created by provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The 501(c) organization has faced a great deal of scrutiny over funding, specifically when it was revealed PCORI was funded by a new tax originating from the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/patient-centered-outcomes-research-institute-fee|title=Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute Fee {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precision medicine ==
Four years after the spectacular [[1000 Genomes Project]] hoped to call in a new era of [[precision medicine]] (PM), some opinion leaders have spoken up for reassessing the value of patient participation to be seen as a driver of PM. The Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, for instance, wrote an editorial in ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' calling for  an amendment to the social contract to boost patient participation, citing a historical precedent: "We need only look back to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic during the 1980s to experience the power of patient advocacy combined with the dogged pursuit of scientific discovery and translation; clearly, motivated patients and scientists as well as their advocates can influence political, scientific, and regulatory agendas to drive advances in health."&lt;ref name=Desmond-Hellmann-2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desmond-Hellmann |first1=Susan  |title=Toward precision medicine: A new social contract? |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=129 |page=129ed3 |department=Editorial |date=11 April 2012 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003473 |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/129/129ed3 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a seminal{{peacock term|date=September 2017}} paper on the topic came out written by Hood and Friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Leroy |last2=Friend |first2=Stephen H. |title=Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (P4) cancer medicine |journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=184–187 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227 |pmid=21364692 |url=https://www.nature.com/nrclinonc/journal/v8/n3/full/nrclinonc.2010.227.html |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second success story is that of the patient John W. Walsh, who founded Alphanet, which has funnelled tens of millions of dollars into research on [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Sam |title=John W.

A more ethically ambivalent development involving patient-funded research involves so-called [[named patient programs]] and [[expanded access]].

MHealth is bringing promising solutions to meet the growing demand for care. With more and more evidence suggesting that the most effective treatment models involve specialized, multi-faceted approaches, and require a variety of materials and effort on both the physician's and patient's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Edward H|last2=Groves|first2=Trish|date=2002-10-26|title=Care for chronic diseases |journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=325|issue=7370|pages=913–914|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1124427|pmid=12399321|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7370.913}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile app]]lications serve as both a method for increasing health literacy, and as a bridge for patient-physician communication (thus increasing patient participation).&lt;ref name="Baysari2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baysari|first=M.

== Patients as research stakeholders ==
{{See also|Health advocacy|Participatory action research}}
Patient participation can include a broad spectrum of activities for human subjects during clinical trials and has become associated with several other words such as "patient engagement" or "decision making".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahdat|first=Shaghayegh|last2=Hamzehgardeshi|first2=Leila|last3=Hessam|first3=Somayeh|last4=Hamzehgardeshi|first4=Zeinab|date=January 2014|title=Patient Involvement in Health Care Decision Making: A Review |journal=Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal|volume=16|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.5812/ircmj.12454|issn=2074-1804|pmc=3964421|pmid=24719703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes agenda-setting, clinical guideline development and clinical trial design. 

According to early career researchers working in the field of patient engagement in research, this research approach is still in its infancy and will become mainstream in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citejournal|last1=Rouleau|first1=Geneviève|last2=Bélisle-Pipon|first2=Jean-Christophe|last3=Birko|first3=Stanislav|last4=Karazivan|first4=Philippe|last5=Fernandez|first5=Nicolas|last6=Bilodeau|first6=Karine|last7=Chao|first7=Yi-Sheng|last8=de Pokomandy|first8=Alexandra|last9=Foley|first9=Véronique|last10=Gagnon|first10=Bruno|last11=Gontijo Guerra|first11=Samantha|last12=Khanji|first12=Cynthia|last13=Lamoureux-Lamarche|first13=Catherine|last14=Lebouché|first14=Bertrand|last15=Lunghi|first15=Carlotta|last16=Menear|first16=Matthew|last17=D.Riverin|first17=Bruno|last18=Rodrigue|first18=Rodrigue|date=2018-10-09|title=Early career researchers’ perspectives and roles in patient-oriented research|journal=Research Involvement and Engagement|doi=10.1186/s40900-018-0117-z|volume=4|issue=1|url=https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40900-018-0117-z|accessdate=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical trials ===

In the US, trends in patient participation have been influenced by a variety of sources and previous political movements. One such source for patient participation in clinical research was the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. During the epidemic, the AIDS activists argued not only for new clinical trial models, but for the importance of additional social service groups to support a wider range of potential human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/1881|title=The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States|last=Council|first=National Research|date=1969-12-31|isbn=9780309046282|doi=10.17226/1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the FDA has taken several steps to include patients earlier in the drug development process. The authorization of [[Prescription Drug User Fee Act|Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) V]] in 2012 included the Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) initiative to provide the FDA with a way of hearing the patients' perspectives and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/forindustry/userfees/prescriptiondruguserfee/ucm453856.htm|title=Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) - Externally-led Patient-Focused Drug Development Meetings|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[European Medicines Agency|European Medicine Agency]] (EMA) has been attempting to incorporate patient perspectives during the evaluation of medicinal products by the EMA scientific committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2014/09/WC500173508.pdf|title=European Medicines Agency|last=|first=|date=23 October 2014|website=www.ema.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an increased interest among healthcare providers, such as nurses, in cultivating patient participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barello|first=Serena|last2=Graffigna|first2=Guendalina|last3=Vegni|first3=Elena|date=2012|title=Patient Engagement as an Emerging Challenge for Healthcare Services: Mapping the Literature|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2012/905934/|journal=Nursing Research and Practice|language=en|volume=2012|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2012/905934|issn=2090-1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this increased interest, studies have been done to assess the benefits and risks of patient participation and engagement in research. For benefits, patient engagement improves patient outcomes as well as clinical trial enrollment and retention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domecq|first=Juan Pablo|last2=Prutsky|first2=Gabriela|last3=Elraiyah|first3=Tarig|last4=Wang|first4=Zhen|last5=Nabhan|first5=Mohammed|last6=Shippee|first6=Nathan|last7=Brito|first7=Juan Pablo|last8=Boehmer|first8=Kasey|last9=Hasan|first9=Rim|date=2014-02-26|title=Patient engagement in research: a systematic review|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-89|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=14|pages=89|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-89|issn=1472-6963}}&lt;/ref&gt; For risks, it has been proposed that the inclusion of patient participation may lead to extended research times and increased funding for clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Two of the reasons to cultivate patient participation in clinical research have been the growth of patient organizations along with the development of databases and the concept of a patient or [[disease registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Sophia K.|last2=Selig|first2=Wendy|last3=Harker|first3=Matthew|last4=Roberts|first4=Jamie N.|last5=Hesterlee|first5=Sharon|last6=Leventhal|first6=David|last7=Klein|first7=Richard|last8=Patrick-Lake|first8=Bray|last9=Abernethy|first9=Amy P.|date=2015-10-14|title=Patient Engagement Practices in Clinical Research among Patient Groups, Industry, and Academia in the United States: A Survey |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0140232|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4605726|pmid=26465328|page=e0140232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer databases allow for the mass collection and dissemination of data. Registries, specifically, not only allow patients to access personal information but also allow physicians to review the outcomes and experiences of multiple patients who have received treatment with medicinal products .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiljer|first=David|last2=Urowitz|first2=Sara|last3=Apatu|first3=Emma|last4=DeLenardo|first4=Claudette|last5=Eysenbach|first5=Gunther|last6=Harth|first6=Tamara|last7=Pai|first7=Howard|last8=Leonard|first8=Kevin J|date=2008-10-31|title=Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records: Exploring Recommendations for Successful Implementation Strategies |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=10|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1061|issn=1438-8871|pmc=2629367|pmid=18974036|page=e34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trotter|first=Jeffrey P.|date=2002|title=Patient Registries: A New Gold Standard for "Real World" Research |journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=211–214|issn=1524-5012|pmc=3400525|pmid=22826660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, registries and patient participation have been particularly important to the development of rare-disease medicines. In the US, the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) was created in 2003 which includes a registry for patients afflicted with a rare-disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/|title=Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN)|website=www.rarediseasesnetwork.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867555228|title=Orphan drugs : understanding the rare disease market and its dynamics|last=Elizabeth.|first=Hernberg-Ståhl,|date=2013|publisher=WP, Woodhead Publishing|others=Reljanović, Miroslav.|isbn=9781908818393|location=Oxford|oclc=867555228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This registry provides information to the patients and allows physicians to contact potential patients for enrollment in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Patient registry" is a developing term, and this 2013 open-access book provides a comprehensive description of the trend toward registries and their networks, i.e. the "broader research collaboratives that connect individual registries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=TA Workman |date=2013 |chapter=Defining Patient Registries and Research Networks |title=Engaging Patients in Information Sharing and Data Collection: The Role of Patient-Powered Registries and Research Networks |location=Rockville MD |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/#top |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients have a new resource to help them navigate the clinical trials landscape and find lay summaries of mediTal research in the OpenTrials database launched by the [[AllTrials]] campaign in 2016 as part of [[open data]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldacre |first1=Ben |last2=Gray |first2=Jonathan |title=OpenTrials: towards a collaborative open database of all available information on all clinical trials |date=8 April 2016 |journal=Trials |volume=17 |page=164 |doi=10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8 |doi-access=free }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precision medicine will change the conduct of clinical trials, and thus the role of patients as subjects. "Key to making precision medicine mainstream is the ongoing shift in the relationship between patients and physicians" comments N.J. Schork from the Venter Institute in ''Nature''. He cites as reasons for this development a growing interest in 'omics' assays and cheap and efficient devices that collect health data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schork |first1=Nicholas J.  |title=Personalized medicine: Time for one-person trials |journal=Nature |volume=520 |issue=7549 |date=29 April 2015 |pages=609–611 |doi=10.1038/520609a |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer article in ''Nature'' outlines the conditions with which patent participation can be optimized, and it is co-authored by Jennifer Wagner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wagner |first1=Jennifer K. |last2=Peltz-Rauchman |first2=Cathryn |last3=Rahm |first3=Alanna K. |last4=Johnson |first4=Christine C. |title=Precision engagement: the PMI's success will depend on more than genomes and big data |journal=Genetics in Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |year=2017 |pages=620–624 |doi=10.1038/gim.2016.165 |url=http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v19/n6/full/gim2016165a.html |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With cancer being a prime target for precision medicine, Dr. Jennifer Carter, founder of the start-up N-of-One, recruits patients to "participate" in clinical trials to help find a cure for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Carte |first1=Jennifer Levin |last2=Cubino |first2=Jennifer|title=Call to Action: Breaking down Barriers for Patient Participation in Oncology Clinical Trials |year=2016 |website=Journal of Precision Medicine |publisher=Kneed Media | url=https://www.thejournalofprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Carter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a [[gestational age]] of 37 complete weeks.&lt;ref name=Steer2005&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Steer P | title = The epidemiology of preterm labour | journal = [[British Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology]] | volume = 112 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 1–3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15715585 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00575.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on [[ventilator]]s. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Mom and Premature Baby at Kapiolani.jpg|thumb|right|A new mother holds her premature baby at [[Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women &amp; Children|Kapiolani Medical Center]] [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] in Honolulu, Hawaii]]
Preterm birth causes a range of problems.&lt;ref name="SaigalDoyle2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saigal S, Doyle LW | title = An overview of mortality and sequelae of preterm birth from infancy to adulthood | journal = The Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608 | pages = 261–269 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18207020 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60136-1 | issn = 0140-6736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm [[labor induction]] and spontaneous preterm [[Childbirth|labor]]. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labour]], true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.

A review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urquhart|first=Christine|last2=Currell|first2=Rosemary|last3=Harlow|first3=Francoise|last4=Callow|first4=Liz|date=15 Feb 2017|title=Home uterine monitoring for detecting preterm labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD006172|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006172.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28205207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Complications===

====Mortality and morbidity====
In the U.S. where many [[neonatal infection]]s and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathew TJ, MacDorman MF |year=2006 |title=Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2003 Period Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set |journal=[[National Vital Statistics Reports]] |volume=54 |issue=16 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.

The earliest [[gestational age]] at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the [[limit of viability]]. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, the limit of viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks.&lt;ref name="Kaempf2006"&gt;

As risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives, there are [[medical ethics|ethical]] controversies over the aggressiveness of the care rendered to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the [[abortion]] debate.&lt;ref name="Arzuaga2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arzuaga BH, Lee BH | title = Limits of Human Viability in the United States: A Medicolegal Review | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = 1047–1052 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22065266 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific risks for the preterm neonate====
Preterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result, they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems.
*Neurological problems include [[apnea of prematurity]], hypoxic-ischemic [[encephalopathy]] (HIE), [[retinopathy of prematurity]] (ROP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Taylor and Hoyt's pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus|others=Lambert, Scott R.,, Lyons, Christopher J.|isbn=9780702066160|edition=Fifth|location=Edinburgh|oclc=960162637|last1 = Lambert|first1 = Scott R.|last2=Lyons|first2=Christopher J.|date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[developmental disability]], [[transient hyperammonemia of the newborn]], [[cerebral palsy]] and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], the latter affecting 25% of babies born preterm, usually before 32 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes&gt;[http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx March of Dimes --&gt; Neonatal Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024114718/http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx |date=24 October 2014 }} Retrieved on November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Mild brain bleeds usually leave no or few lasting complications, but severe bleeds often result in brain damage or even death.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes/&gt; Neurodevelopmental problems have been linked to lack of maternal [[thyroid hormone]]s, at a time when their own [[thyroid]] is unable to meet postnatal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berbel P, Navarro D, Ausó E, Varea E, Rodríguez AE, Ballesta JJ, Salinas M, Flores E, Faura CC, de Escobar GM | title = Role of late maternal thyroid hormones in cerebral cortex development: an experimental model for human prematurity | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1462–75 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 19812240 | pmc = 2871377 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhp212 | url = http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/6/1462 | journal=Cerebral Cortex}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiovascular complications may arise from the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth: [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA).
*Respiratory problems are common, specifically the [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] (RDS or IRDS) (previously called hyaline membrane disease). Another problem can be [[Bronchopulmonary dysplasia|chronic lung disease]] (previously called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).
*Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues can arise from [[neonatal hypoglycemia]], feeding difficulties, [[rickets]] of prematurity, [[hypocalcemia]], [[inguinal hernia]], and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).
*Hematologic complications include [[anemia of prematurity]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] (jaundice) that can lead to [[kernicterus]].
*Infection, including [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[urinary tract infection]] {{ref|1}}

== Risk factors ==
The exact cause of preterm birth is difficult to determine and it may be multi-factorial. The cause of 50% of preterm births is never determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhabra|first=S|date=September 2017|title=Preterm Births, Whys, Whats and Way Forward|url=https://www.ecronicon.com/ecpe/pdf/ECPE-05-00151.pdf|journal=Ecronicon|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labor is a complex process involving many factors. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension (placental abruption), decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11353/|title=Biological Pathways Leading to Preterm Birth|last=Behrman|first=Richard E.|last2=Butler|first2=Adrienne Stith|last3=Outcomes|first3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy|date=2007|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying women at high risk of giving birth early would enable the health services to provide specialized care for these women to delay the birth or make sure they are in the best place to give birth (for example a hospital with a special care baby unit). Risk scoring systems have been suggested as a possible way of identifying these women. However, there is no research in this area so it is unclear whether the risk scoring systems would prolong pregnancy and reduce the numbers of preterm births or not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davey|first1=MA|last2=Watson|first2=L|last3=Rayner|first3=JA|last4=Rowlands|first4=S|title=Risk-scoring systems for predicting preterm birth with the aim of reducing associated adverse outcomes|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=22 October 2015|volume=10|issue=10|pages=CD004902|pmid=26490698|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004902.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of factors have been identified that are linked to a higher risk of a preterm birth such as being less than 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008&gt;

Further, in the U.S. and the UK, [[Black people|black]] women have preterm birth rates of 15–18%, more than double than that of the white population. [[Filipinos]] are also at high risk of premature birth, and it is believed that nearly 11–15% of Filipinos born in the U.S. (compared to other Asians at 7.6% and whites at 7.8%) are premature.&lt;ref name="hawaii.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2014/01/14/preterm-birth-by-filipino-women-linked-to-genetic-mutational-change/ |title=Preterm birth by Filipino women linked to genetic mutational change |accessdate=2014-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811122154/http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2014/01/14/preterm-birth-by-filipino-women-linked-to-genetic-mutational-change/ |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipinos being a big risk factor is evidenced with the [[Philippines]] being the 8th highest ranking in the world for preterm births, the only non-African country in the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartparenting.com.ph/community/news/unicef-philippines-has-one-of-the-highest-premature-birth-rates-in-the-world |title=Smart Parenting: The Filipino Parenting Authority |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814165910/http://www.smartparenting.com.ph/community/news/unicef-philippines-has-one-of-the-highest-premature-birth-rates-in-the-world |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy is not seen in comparison to other Asian groups or Hispanic immigrants and remains unexplained.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt;

A history of spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) or surgical [[abortion]] has been associated with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth, with an increased risk with increased number of abortions, although it is unclear whether the increase is caused by the abortion or by confounding risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic status).&lt;ref name="rcog-care"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]| title = The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion| work = Evidence-based Clinical Guideline No. 7| pages = 44, 45| date = November 2011| accessdate = May 31, 2013| url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/Abortion%20guideline_web_1.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529004416/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/Abortion%20guideline_web_1.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2012-05-29| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased risk has not been shown in women who terminated their pregnancies [[medical abortion|medically]].&lt;ref&gt;

Genetic make-up is a factor in the causality of preterm birth.

===Factors during pregnancy===
The use of [[fertility medication]] that stimulates the ovary to release multiple eggs and of IVF with [[embryo transfer]] of multiple embryos has been implicated as an important factor in preterm birth.

Infectious microorganisms can be ascending, hematogeneous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the Fallopian tubes.

It has been reported that asymptomatic [[colonization]] of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a [[DNA probe]] suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response.

As the condition is more prevalent in black women in the US and the UK, it has been suggested to be an explanation for the higher rate of preterm birth in these populations. It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. The condition known as [[aerobic vaginitis]] can be a serious risk factor for preterm labor; several previous studies failed to acknowledge the difference between aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis, which may explain some of the contradiction in the results.&lt;ref&gt;Donders, G; Bellen, G; Rezeberga, D (2011).

A review into prophylactic antibiotics (given to prevent infection) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (13–42 weeks of pregnancy) found a reduction in the number of preterm births in women with bacterial vaginosis. These antibiotics also reduced the number of waters breaking before labor in full-term pregnancies, reduced the risk of infection of the lining of the womb after delivery (endometritis), and rates of gonococcal infection. However, the women without bacterial vaginosis did not have any reduction in preterm births or pre-labor preterm waters breaking. Much of the research included in this review lost participants during follow-up so did not report the long-term effects of the antibiotics on mothers or babies. More research in this area is needed to find the full effects of giving antibiotics throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thinkhamrop|first1=J|last2=Hofmeyr|first2=GJ|last3=Adetoro|first3=O|last4=Lumbiganon|first4=P|last5=Ota|first5=E|title=Antibiotic prophylaxis during the second and third trimester to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes and morbidity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=20 June 2015|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD002250|pmid=26092137|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002250.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of maternal bacterial infections are associated with preterm birth including [[pyelonephritis]], asymptomatic [[bacteriuria]], [[pneumonia]], and [[appendicitis]]. A review into giving antibiotics in pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine infection with no symptoms) found the research was of very low quality but that it did suggest that taking antibiotics reduced the numbers of preterm births and babies with low birth weight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smaill|first1=FM|last2=Vazquez|first2=JC|title=Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 August 2015|volume=8|issue=8|pages=CD000490|pmid=26252501|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000490.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review found that one dose of antibiotics did not seem as effective as a course of antibiotics but fewer women reported side effects from one dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widmer|first1=M|last2=Lopez|first2=I|last3=Gülmezoglu|first3=AM|last4=Mignini|first4=L|last5=Roganti|first5=A|title=Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=11 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD000491|pmid=26560337|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000491.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review recommended that more research is needed to discover the best way of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A different review found that preterm births happened less for pregnant women who had routine testing for low genital tract infections than for women who only had testing when they showed symptoms of low genital tract infections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sangkomkamhang|first1=US|last2=Lumbiganon|first2=P|last3=Prasertcharoensuk|first3=W|last4=Laopaiboon|first4=M|title=Antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs for preventing preterm delivery|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=1 February 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD006178|pmid=25922860|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006178.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women being routinely tested also gave birth to fewer babies with a low birth weight. Even though these results look promising, the review was only based on one study so more research is needed into routine screening for low genital tract infections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Also [[periodontal disease]] has been shown repeatedly to be linked to preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Placental alpha microglobulin-1===

Specifically, the PPV, or [[positive predictive value]], of the tests were 76%, 29%, and 30% for PAMG-1, fFN and CL, respectively (P &lt; 0.01).&lt;ref&gt;Nikolova T, Bayev O, Nikolova N, Di Renzo GC.

===Fetal fibronectin===
[[Fetal fibronectin]] (fFN) has become an important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg2008/&gt; It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ultrasound===
{{Further|Cervical incompetence}}
[[Obstetric ultrasound]] has become useful in the assessment of the [[cervix]] in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: A cervical length of less than 25&amp;nbsp;mm at or before 24 weeks of [[gestational age]] is the most common definition of [[cervical incompetence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiopaedia.org/articles/cervical_incompetence Cervical incompetence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307205141/http://radiopaedia.org/articles/cervical_incompetence |date=7 March 2014 }} from [[Radiopaedia]].

==Prevention==
Historically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children.&lt;ref name=Iams2008&gt;

===Before pregnancy===
Adoption of specific professional policies can immediately reduce risk of preterm birth as the experience in assisted reproduction has shown when the number of embryos during embryo transfer was limited.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt;
Many countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous or night-shift work and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave. The EUROPOP study showed that preterm birth is not related to type of employment, but to prolonged work (over 42 hours per week) or prolonged standing (over 6 hours per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saurel-Cubizolles MJ, Zeitlin J, Lelong N, Papiernik E, Di Renzo GC, Bréart G | title = Employment, working conditions, and preterm birth: results from the Europop case-control survey | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 395–401 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15082738 | pmc = 1732750 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2003.008029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, night work has been linked to preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;Other Complications include:
* Jaundice Of Prematurity
* Atrial septal defects commonly seen in babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia because their lungs are so fragile.
* GER Gastroesophageal reflux
* Patent Ductus Arterosis
* Seizures
* Immature GI system so feeding from an (NG) tube or nasogastric tube may help make feeding easier on the babies' tummy. Also theirs{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} TPN feeding or Total Parenteral Nutrition is made up of lipids, calories, good fats calcium, magnesium sulfate and other vitamins including B and C. Neonatalogists work with the family as a whole instead of just the neonate or baby whose systems are to immature to actually swallow food so babies between 23-28 weeks are fed through a neonatal gastric tube from the babies nose to the stomach. In some neonates, there are disabilities from varying conditions of the baby this depends on the gestational age the babies delivered a.uUsually, women with severe enough preeclampsia will deliver earlier than normal and those mothers worry greatly because of all of their rumors about NICUs and babies needing wheelchairs glasses and also needing medicines for seizures and ADD/ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, [[anxiety disorder]]s.

Healthy eating can be instituted at any stage of the pregnancy including nutritional adjustments, use of vitamin supplements, and [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Calcium supplementation in women who have low dietary calcium reduces the number of negative outcomes including preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and maternal death.&lt;ref name=Hofmeyr2014&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmeyr|first=G.

====Screening of low risk women====

Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria followed by appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Romero R, Oyarzun E, Mazor M, Sirtori M, Hobbins JC, Bracken M | title = Meta-analysis of the relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and preterm delivery/low birth weight | journal = [[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology]] | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 576–582 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2927852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but [[cerclage]] is not proven useful, and the application of a progestogen is under study.&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt; Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk.

====Self-care====

Self-care methods to reduce the risk of preterm birth include proper nutrition, avoiding stress, seeking appropriate medical care, avoiding infections, and the control of preterm birth risk factors (e.g. working long hours while standing on feet, carbon monoxide exposure, domestic abuse, and other factors). Self-monitoring vaginal pH followed by yogurt treatment or clindamycin treatment if the pH was too high all seem to be effective at reducing the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Reducing existing risks===
Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a [[uterine septum]]), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others.

====Multiple pregnancies====
In [[multiple pregnancy|multiple pregnancies]], which often result from use of [[assisted reproductive technology]], there is a high risk of preterm birth. [[Selective reduction]] is used to reduce the number of fetuses to two or three.&lt;ref name=ACOG2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion Number 719: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction |url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Multifetal-Pregnancy-Reduction |publisher=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Ethics. |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zipori2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zipori |first1=Y |last2=Haas |first2=J |last3=Berger |first3=H |last4=Barzilay |first4=E |title=Multifetal pregnancy reduction of triplets to twins compared with non-reduced triplets: a meta-analysis. |journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online |date=September 2017 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=296–304 |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2017.05.012 |pmid=28625760}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=MI |last2=Andriole |first2=S |last3=Britt |first3=DW |title=Fetal reduction: 25 years' experience. |journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy |date=2014 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1159/000357974 |pmid=24525884}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reducing indicated preterm birth====
A number of agents have been studied for the secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth.

=====Antibiotics=====

While antibiotics can get rid of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, this does not appear to change the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|issue=1|pages=CD000262|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000262.pub4|pmid=23440777|vauthors=Brocklehurst P, Gordon A, Heatley E, Milan SJ|df=dmy-all|pmc=4164464}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that chronic chorioamnionitis is not sufficiently treated by antibiotics alone (and therefore they cannot ameliorate the need for preterm delivery in this condition).&lt;ref name=Iams2008/&gt;

=====Progestogens=====

[[Progestogen]]s, often given in the form of [[progesterone (medication)|progesterone]] or [[hydroxyprogesterone caproate]], relaxes the uterine musculature, maintains cervical length, and has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus exerts activities expected to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40–55%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|issue=7|pages=CD004947|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004947.pub3|pmid=23903965|vauthors=Dodd JM, Jones L, Flenady V, Cincotta R, Crowther CA|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=====Cervical cerclage=====

In preparation for [[childbirth]], the woman's [[cervix]] shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. [[Cervical cerclage]] is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth.&lt;ref name=Iams2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Management==

Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the [[Fetal fibronectin|fibronectin test]] and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Steroids===
Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs because they are not yet producing their own [[surfactant]]. This can lead directly to [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of [[glucocorticoids]], a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the baby.&lt;ref name=ACOG2016/&gt; Steroid use up to 37 weeks is also recommended by the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2016/&gt; Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]], often when the pregnancy has reached [[Fetal viability|viability]] at 23 weeks.

In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second "rescue" course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There are still some concerns about the efficacy and side effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. A 2015 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowther|first=Caroline A.|last2=McKinlay|first2=Christopher J.

Beside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular bleeding, [[necrotising enterocolitis]], and [[patent ductus arteriosus]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Devender|last2=Brown|first2=Julie|last3=Medley|first3=Nancy|last4=Dalziel|first4=Stuart R.|date=21 Mar 2017|title=Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|pages=CD004454|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004454.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28321847}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery, but there are some concerns about applicability of this recommendation to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownfoot|first=Fiona C.|last2=Gagliardi|first2=Daniela I.|last3=Bain|first3=Emily|last4=Middleton|first4=Philippa|last5=Crowther|first5=Caroline A.|date=2013-08-29|title=Different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD006764|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006764.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23990333|pmc=4164475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants. There is ongoing discussion about when steroids should be given (i.e. only antenatally or postnatally too) and for how long (i.e. single course or repeated administration). Despite these unknowns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single course of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994AntenatalSteroidPerinatal095html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: The Effect of Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturation on Perinatal Outcomes |accessdate=2017-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174327/https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994antenatalsteroidperinatal095html.htm |archivedate=9 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: Antenatal Corticosteroids Revisited: Repeat Courses |accessdate=2017-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118011125/https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |archivedate=18 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McGoldrick|first1=Emma|last2=Brown|first2=Julie|last3=Middleton|first3=Philippa|last4=McKinlay|first4=Christopher JD|last5=Haas|first5=David M|last6=Crowther|first6=Caroline A|title=Antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation: an overview of Cochrane reviews|date=17 April 2016|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd012156|df=dmy-all|hdl=1805/11459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
The routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby to get infected with [[Streptococcus agalactiae|group B streptococcus]] and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schrag S, Gorwitz R, Fultz-Butts K, Schuchat A | title = Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Revised guidelines from CDC | journal = [[MMWR. Recommendations and Reports]] | volume = 51 | issue = RR-11 | pages = 1–22 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12211284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When membranes rupture prematurely, obstetrical management looks for development of labor and signs of infection. Prophylactic antibiotic administration has been shown to prolong pregnancy and reduced neonatal morbidity with rupture of membranes at less than 34 weeks.&lt;ref name="Kenyon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Broad-spectrum antibiotics for preterm, prelabour rupture of fetal membranes: the ORACLE I randomised trial.

===Tocolysis===
A number of medications may be useful to delay delivery including: [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[calcium channel blocker]]s, [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta mimetics]], and [[atosiban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haas DM, Caldwell DM, Kirkpatrick P, McIntosh JJ, Welton NJ | title = Tocolytic therapy for preterm delivery: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 345 | pages = e6226 | date = Oct 9, 2012 | pmid = 23048010 | pmc = 4688428 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e6226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tocolytic|Tocolysis]] rarely delays delivery beyond 24–48 hours.&lt;ref name=Simham2007&gt;

=== Mode of delivery ===
The routine use of [[caesarean section]] for early delivery of infants expected to have very low [[birth weight]] is controversial,&lt;ref name="Iams2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alfirevic|first=Zarko|last2=Milan|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Livio|first3=Stefania|date=2012-06-13|title=Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth in singletons|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD000078|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000078.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164504|pmid=22696314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery probably needs to be made on a case by case basis.

===Neonatal care===
After delivery, plastic wraps or warm mattresses are useful to keep the infant warm on their way to the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCall EM, Alderdice F, Halliday HL, Jenkins JG, Vohra S | title = Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birthweight infants. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD004210 | date = Mar 17, 2010 | pmid = 20238329 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004210.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29431872|date = July 2018}} In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in an NICU. The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as [[neonatology|neonatologists]]. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in [[neonatal incubator|incubator]]s (also called isolettes), which are [[bassinet]]s enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]], and [[Electroencephalography|brain activity]]. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] catheters, [[oxygen]] supplementation, [[mechanical ventilation]] support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as ''[[kangaroo care]]'' (skin to skin warming), encouraging [[breastfeeding]], and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm [[morbidity]] and mortality. [[Bili light]]s may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).

Water can be carefully provided to prevent dehydration but no so much to increase risks of side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell EF, Acarregui MJ | title = Restricted versus liberal water intake for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD000503 | date = 4 December 2014 | pmid = 25473815 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000503.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preterm birth complicates the births of infants worldwide affecting 5% to 18% of births.&lt;ref name= rob2015/&gt; In Europe and many developed countries the preterm birth rate is generally 5–9%, and in the USA it has even risen to 12–13% in the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delnord|first=Marie|last2=Blondel|first2=Béatrice|last3=Zeitlin|first3=Jennifer|date=April 2015|title=What contributes to disparities in the preterm birth rate in European countries?|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=133–142|doi=10.1097/GCO.0000000000000156|issn=1040-872X|pmc=4352070|pmid=25692506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As weight is easier to determine than gestational age, the [[World Health Organization]] tracks rates of low [[birth weight]] (&lt; 2,500&amp;nbsp;grams), which occurred in 16.5 percent of births in less developed regions in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Data and statistics |url=http://www.who.int/research/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216204220/http://www.who.int/research/en/ |archivedate=16 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that one third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to preterm delivery. Weight generally correlates to gestational age, however, infants may be underweight for other reasons than a preterm delivery. Neonates of low birth weight (LBW) have a birth weight of less than 2500 g (5&amp;nbsp;lb 8 oz) and are mostly but not exclusively preterm babies as they also include ''[[small for gestational age]]'' (SGA) babies. Weight-based classification further recognizes ''Very Low Birth Weight'' (VLBW) which is less than 1,500 g, and ''Extremely Low Birth Weight'' (ELBW) which is less than 1,000 g.&lt;ref name="SubramanianKNS"&gt;

Complications from preterm births resulted in 740,000 deaths in 2013, down from 1.57 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
Preterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the US determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500–700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ethics==

The transformation of medical care means that extremely premature and very ill babies have better chances of survival than ever before. But it is difficult to predict which babies will die and which will live, though possibly with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable.

The most difficult decisions are about whether or not to resuscitate a premature baby and admit him or her to neonatal intensive care, or whether to withdraw intensive care and give the child [[palliative care]].

This is discussed at great length in a report "Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine: ethical issues"&lt;ref&gt;

'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human [[health]] through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory]]|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |pages=183–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing the health of a population and the threats is the basis for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "public" in question can be as small as a handful of people, an entire village or it can be as large as several continents, in the case of a [[pandemic]]. "Health" takes into account physical, mental and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Public health is [[interdisciplinary]]. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]] are all relevant. [[Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]] and [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], gender issues in health, sexual and reproductive health are other important subfields.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting [[hand washing|handwashing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]] and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[medical assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists and data managers.]]  Depending on the need [[environmental health officer]]s or [[public health inspector]]s, [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], and even [[veterinarian]]s, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists might be called on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery &amp; Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health &amp; Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example, in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When foreign aid is funnelled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Uy Hoang, Stella B, May CI van S|title=What’s in the ‘Public Health Toolbox’|journal=JOJ Pub Health|year=2018|volume=3|issue=2|page=555607|url=https://juniperpublishers.com/jojph/pdf/JOJPH.MS.ID.555607.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for [[health care]] services, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solorzana, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.  Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics.  Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Solórzano | first2 = A. | title = Public health policy paradoxes: Science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 1197–1213 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10501641| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|issn=0094-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives - around two-thirds - were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community).  Only about one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

=== Public Health 2.0 ===
''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and [[health blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=13 June 2011 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=DMKD&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Yom-Tov |first2=Elad |last3=Pebody |first3=Richard| last4=Cox |first4=Ingemar J. |date=2 July 2015 |title=Assessing the impact of a health intervention via user-generated Internet content |journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | doi=10.1007/s10618-015-0427-9 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the collection and sharing of information about [[environmental radiation]] levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 13 June 2011 |author = D. Parvaz |date=26 April 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from [[Web 2.0]], such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[information sharing]], and [[user-centred design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hardey, Michael |date=July 2008 | title = Public health and Web 2.0 | journal = Perspectives in Public Health | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 181–189 | doi=10.1177/1466424008092228}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to "Public Health 2.0" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Developing countries==
[[File:MRT Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Emergency Response Team in [[Burma]] after [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008]]
There is a great disparity in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers,]] monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=D T|last2=Mosley|first2=W H|date=January 1991|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries: health policy responses to epidemiological change.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.2105/ajph.81.1.15|pmid=1983911|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1404931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases.  In addition to this however, many [[developing countries]] are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases with, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"/&gt; Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty.  The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Each day brings new front-page headlines about public health: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health effects of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20policy%20interventions%20-%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;f=false|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor=Richard G.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Proponents of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, a 2014-2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Sustainable development goals ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 - United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1-6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries.&lt;ref name=UN2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals - United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|global public health]]: [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and women's empowerment, and water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN2015/&gt; Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to better public health outcome. 
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrhoel diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015/&gt;

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|last=|first=|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]]  (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition and [[environmental and occupational health]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. (1999). ''Achievements in Public Health, 1900–1999'' - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health Agency of Canada. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php-psp/mphpg-mhplg/mphp-mhpp04-eng.php Canadian Public Health Workforce Core Competencies], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]], among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of public health: a US perspective===
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=William H.|last2=Rose|first2=Wickliffe|year=1915|title=Institute of Hygiene: Being a report by Dr. William H.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182530966|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933-2013,|first=Burrow, Gerard N.,|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHP/&gt;

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911051643/http://www.asph.org/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltaomega.org/ Delta Omega website] (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The primitive nature of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] medicine rendered Europe helpless to the onslaught of the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century. Miniature from "The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis" (1272-1352). Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]]
Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. [[leadership|Leaders]] were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability, [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medical doctors]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion.

In 1485 the [[Republic of Venice]] established a permanent [[Venetian Magistrate for Health]] comprising supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad. The three supervisors were initially appointed by the Venetian Senate. In 1537 it was assumed by the Grand Council, and in 1556 added two judges, with the task of control, on behalf of the Republic, the efforts of the supervisors.

However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").

===Modern public health===
The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/History-Britains-Hospitals-Barry-Carruthers/dp/1857769058/ Carruthers, G. Barry. ''History of Britain's Hospitals'' (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482384/public-health/35547/National-developments-in-the-18th-and-19th-centuries|title=public health|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|1802 caricature of [[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Vale, Brian. "The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: A Challenge to Current Orthodoxy". ''[[The Mariners' Mirror]]'', volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]] published ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the [[military]] [[barracks]] and the provision of [[latrine]]s for the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | pmid=5330009 | last=Selwyn | first=S | publication-date=July 1966| year=1966 | title=Sir John Pringle: hospital reformer, moral philosopher and pioneer of antiseptics | volume=10 | issue=3 | periodical=Medical History | pages=266–74 | pmc=1033606 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300011133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda J.

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871-1948 : a Medical Conundrum|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epidemiology====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s dot map, showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854.]]
The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter,  ''et al.'' (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898.]]
With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital - A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]].

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&amp;site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country examples ===
====France====
[[French Third Republic|France 1871-1914]]  followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252-75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888-1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890-1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

{{see also|United States Public Health Service}}

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Visiting_Nurse_Service_of_New_York_Logo.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]], founded by nursing pioneer [[Lillian Wald]] in 1893]] --&gt;
In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The federal Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) operated a large-scale field nursing program. Field nurses targeted native women for health education, emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hancock Christin L | year = 2001 | title = Healthy Vocatoons:  Field Nursing and the Religious Overtones of Public Health | url = | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 113–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====

[[File:IMSS.jpg|thumb|right|Logo for the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]], a governmental agency dealing with public health.]]
Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761-1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, Mexico was in the process of modernization, and public health issues were again tackled from a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga and Claudia Agostoni, "Science and Public Health in the Century of Revolution," in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H. Beezley, ed. Blackwell Publishing 2011, pp. 561-574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Agostoni, ''Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876-1910''.

Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), public health was an important concern, with a text on hygiene published in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto J. Pani, ''La higiene en México''. Mexico: Imprenta de J. Ballescá 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mexican Revolution, feminist and trained nurse [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] founded the [[Neutral White Cross]], treating wounded soldiers no matter for what faction they fought.

In the post-revolutionary period after 1920, improved public health was a revolutionary goal of the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Elaine Bliss, "The Science of Redemption: Syphilis, Sexual Promiscuity, and Reformism in Revolutionary Mexico City" ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 79:1 1999, pp. 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Aréchiga Córdoba, "Educación, propaganda o 'Dictadura sanitaria'.

The Mexican state promoted the health of the Mexican population, with most resources going to cities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Mazzaferri, "Public Health and Social Revolution in Mexico." PhD dissertation, Kent State University 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sowell, ''Medicine on the Periphery: Public Health in Yucatán, 1870-1960''. Lanham: Lexington Books 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern about disease conditions and social impediments to the improvement of Mexicans' health were important in the formation of the [[Eugenics in Mexico|Mexican Society for Eugenics]]. The movement flourished from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Minna Stern, "Responsible Mother and Normal Children: Eugenics, Nationalism, and Welfare in Post-revolutionary Mexico, 1920-1940." ''Journal of Historical Sociology'' vol. 12, no. 4, December 1999, pp. 369-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico was not alone in Latin America or the world in promoting [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Leys Stepan, ''The Hour of Eugenics: Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Government campaigns against disease and alcoholism were also seen as promoting public health.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Pierce, "Fighting Bacteria, the Bible, and the Bottle: Projects to Create New Men, Women, and Children, 1910-1940" in ''Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H.

The [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] was established in 1943, during the administration of President [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] to deal with public health, pensions, and social security.

====Cuba====
{{see also|Timeline of healthcare in Cuba}}
Since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] the [[Cuban government]] has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of [[Healthcare in Cuba|health conditions]] for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Pineo, “Public Health”, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuban medical internationalism]] as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially [[Mission Barrio Adentro|Venezuela]], as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

====Colombia and Bolivia====
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state.  In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Hanni Jalil, "Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930-1940." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Pacino, "Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952-1964."

'''Quality of life''' ('''QOL''') is the general [[well-being]]  of individuals and societies, outlining negative and positive features of life. It observes life satisfaction, including everything from physical health, family, education, employment, wealth, safety, security to freedom, religious beliefs, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/iese/2013/09/04/quality-of-life-everyone-wants-it-but-what-is-it/#405f6fdb2c7d|title=Quality Of Life: Everyone Wants It, But What Is It?|last=Barcaccia|first=Barbara|date=4 September 2013|website=Forbes/ Education|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; QOL has a wide range of contexts, including the fields of [[international development]], healthcare, politics and employment. It is important not to mix up the concept of QOL with a more recent growing area of [[Quality of life (healthcare)|health related QOL]] (HRQOL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Cancer Patient and Quality of Life|url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/7/2/120|journal = The Oncologist|year = 2002|access-date = 7 May 2015|issn = 1083-7159|pmid = 11961195|pages = 120–125|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-2-120|first = Andrew|last = Bottomley}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An assessment of HRQOL is effectively an evaluation of QOL and its relationship with health.

Quality of life should not be confused with the concept of [[standard of living]], which is based primarily on income.

==Overview==
Standard indicators of the quality of life include not only wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging.&lt;ref name="DHG"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Derek |display-editors= 4 |editor1-last= Gregory |editor1-link= Derek Gregory |editor2-first= Ron |editor2-last= Johnston |editor3-first= Geraldine |editor3-last= Pratt |editor4-first= Michael |editor4-last= Watts |editor4-link= Michael Watts |editor5-first= Sarah |editor5-last= Whatmore |title=Dictionary of Human Geography |edition=5th |date=June 2009 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-4051-3287-9 |chapter= Quality of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]], ed.

According to ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]]:
{{quote|While Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit policy goal, adequate definition and measurement have been elusive. Diverse "objective" and "subjective" indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on [[subjective well-being]] (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred renewed interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index169.html|author=Costanza, R.|displayauthors=etal|year=2008|title=An Integrative Approach to Quality of Life Measurement, Research, and Policy|journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S.|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One approach, called [[engaged theory]], outlined in the journal of ''Applied Research in the Quality of Life'', posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | date=2012 | last1= Magee | first1= Liam | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy| title= Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/5178539/Measuring_Social_Sustainability_A_Community-Centred_Approach | journal= Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume= 7 | issue= 3 | pages= 239–61 | doi=10.1007/s11482-012-9166-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domain of culture, for example, it includes the following subdomains of quality of life:

* Belief and ideas
* Creativity and recreation
* Enquiry and learning
* Gender and generations
* Identity and engagement
* Memory and projection 
* Wellbeing and health

Also frequently related are concepts such as freedom, [[human rights]], and [[happiness]]. However, since happiness is subjective and difficult to measure, other measures are generally given priority. It has also been shown that happiness, as much as it can be measured, does not necessarily increase correspondingly with the comfort that results from increasing income. As a result, standard of living should not be taken to be a measure of happiness.&lt;ref name="DHG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Richard |last1= Layard |author1-link= Richard Layard, Baron Layard |title=Happiness: Lessons from a New Science |date = 6 April 2006 |publisher= Penguin |location= London |isbn= 978-0-14-101690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sometimes considered related is the concept of [[human security]], though the latter may be considered at a more basic level and for all people.

==Quantitative measurement==
Unlike [[Gross domestic product|''per capita'' GDP]] or [[standard of living]], both of which can be measured in financial terms, it is harder to make objective or long-term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people. Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well-being: ''[[Emotional well-being]]'', in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences—the frequency and intensity of their experiences of, for example, joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection— and ''life evaluation'', in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1011492107|title=High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being|date=2010|last1=Kahneman|first1=D.|last2=Deaton|first2=A.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=107|issue=38|pages=16489–16493|pmid=20823223|pmc=2944762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time. Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, ''The Increasing Importance of Quality of Life'', October 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019030621/http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care, wealth and materialistic goods. However, it is much more difficult to measure [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] expression of one's desires. One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals. Quality of life can simply mean [[happiness]], the subjective state of mind. By using that mentality, citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care, education and child protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|date=2011|title=THE BIG QUESTION: Quality of Life: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

===Human Development Index===
{{Main | Human Development Index}}
Perhaps the most commonly used international measure of development is the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines measures of life expectancy, education, and standard of living, in an attempt to quantify the options available to individuals within a given society.  The HDI is used by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in their [[Human Development Report]].

===World Happiness Report===
{{Main | World Happiness Report}}
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey on the state of global happiness. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, reflecting growing global interest in using happiness and substantial well-being as an indicator of the quality of human development. Its growing purpose has allowed governments, communities and organizations to use appropriate data to record happiness in order to enable policies to provide better lives. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldhappiness.report/|title=World Happiness Report|date=2016|website=Overview|publisher=Helliwell, J., Layard, R., &amp; Sachs, J. (2016). World Happiness Report 2016, Update (Vol. I). New York: Sustainable Development Solutions Network|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also developed by the [[United Nations]] and published recently along with the HDI, this report combines both objective and subjective measures to rank countries by happiness, which is deemed as the ultimate outcome of a high quality of life. It uses surveys from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, and generosity to derive the final score. Happiness is already recognised as an important concept in global public policy. The World Happiness Report indicates that some regions have in recent years been experiencing progressive inequality of happiness. Without life, there is no happiness to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 March 2016|title=Health and Happiness|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Health+and+happiness&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Lancet&amp;rft.au=The+Lancet&amp;rft.date=2016-03-26&amp;rft.pub=Elsevier+Limited&amp;rft.issn=0140-6736&amp;rft.eissn=1474-547X&amp;rft.volume=387&amp;rft.issue=10025&amp;rft.spage=1251&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2FS0140-6736%2816%2930062-9&amp;rft.externalDocID=4004789551&amp;paramdict=en-AU|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30062-9|access-date=13 May 2016|volume=387|pages=1251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===
The [[Physical Quality of Life Index]] (PQLI) is a measure developed by sociologist Morris David Morris in the 1970s, based on basic literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy.  Although not as complex as other measures, and now essentially replaced by the Human Development Index, the PQLI is notable for Morris's attempt to show a "less fatalistic pessimistic picture" by focusing on three areas where global quality of life was generally improving at the time and ignoring [[gross national product]] and other possible indicators that were not improving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morris | first = Morris David | title = The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) | journal = Development Digest | volume = 1 | pages = 95–109 | date = January 1980  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Happy Planet Index]], introduced in 2006, is unique among quality of life measures in that, in addition to standard determinants of well-being, it uses each country's [[ecological footprint]] as an indicator.  As a result, European and North American nations do not dominate this measure.  The 2012 list is instead topped by [[Costa Rica]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Happy Planet Index 2.0 | publisher = New Economics Foundation | date = 2012 | url = http://www.happyplanetindex.org/  | accessdate = 2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup research]]ers trying to find the world's [[happiness|happiest]] countries found [[Denmark]] to be at the top of the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html?partner=popstories |title=Table: The World's Happiest Countries |publisher=Forbes |first=Francesca |last=Levy |date=14 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180745/http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html?partner=popstories|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[uSwitch]] publishes an annual quality of life index for European countries. [[France]] has topped the list for the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/29/uk-worst-quality-of-life-europe |title=Table: UK has 'worst quality of life in Europe' |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=King |date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by two [[Princeton University]] professors looked at 1,000 randomly selected U.S. residents over an extended period. It concludes that their ''life evaluations'' – that is, their considered evaluations of their life against a stated scale of one to ten – rise steadily with income. On the other hand, their reported quality of ''emotional daily experiences'' (their reported experiences of [[joy]], [[affection]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[sadness]], or [[anger]]) levels off after a certain income level (approximately $75,000 per year); income above $75,000 does not lead to more experiences of happiness nor to further relief of unhappiness or stress. Below this income level, respondents reported decreasing happiness and increasing sadness and stress, implying the pain of life's misfortunes, including [[disease]], [[divorce]], and [[solitude|being alone]], is exacerbated by [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Higher income improves life rating but not emotional well-being|url=http://www.physorg.com/news203060471.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=20 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gross national happiness]] and other subjective measures of happiness are being used by the governments of [[Government of Bhutan|Bhutan]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/well-being-wheel-of-measures/index.html|title=Measures of National Well-Being}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Happiness report, issued by Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2012/World%20Happiness%20Report.pdf|title=World Happiness Report|editors=John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a meta-analysis of happiness globally and provides an overview of countries and grassroots activists using GNH.  The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] issued a guide for the use of subjective well-being metrics in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being|url=http://www.oecd.org/statistics/Guidelines%20on%20Measuring%20Subjective%20Well-being.pdf|year=2013|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=978-92-64-19165-5|doi=10.1787/9789264191655-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., cities and communities are using a GNH metric at a grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.happycounts.org/happiness-initiatives/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222632/http://www.happycounts.org/happiness-initiatives/ |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Progress Index]] measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-two indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of wellbeing, and opportunity show the relative performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there is sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.

Day-Reconstruction Method was another way of measuring happiness, in which researchers asked their subjects to recall various things they did on the previous day and describe their mood during each activity. Being simple and approachable, this method required memory and the experiments have confirmed that the answers that people give are similar to those who repeatedly recalled each subject. The method eventually declined as it called for more effort and thoughtful responses, which often included interpretations and outcomes that do not occur to people who are asked to record every action in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Happiness : What Government Can Learn from the New Research on Well-Being|last=Derek|first=Boc|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=February 2010|isbn=9781400832194|location=United States|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livability===
The term ''quality of life'' is also used by politicians and economists to measure the livability of a given city or nation.  Two widely known measures of livability are the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Where-to-be-born Index]] and [[world's most livable cities|Mercer's Quality of Living Reports]].  These two measures calculate the livability of countries and cities around the world, respectively, through a combination of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] life-satisfaction surveys and objective determinants of quality of life such as divorce rates, safety, and infrastructure. Such measures relate more broadly to the population of a city, state, or country, not to individual quality of life. Livability has a long history and tradition in [[urban design]], and neighborhoods design standards such as [[LEED-ND]] are often used in an attempt to influence livability.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|display-authors=etal|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crimes====
Some crimes against property (e.g., graffiti and vandalism) and some "[[victimless crimes]]" have been referred to as "quality-of-life crimes." American [[sociologist]] [[James Q. Wilson]] encapsulated this argument as the [[broken windows theory]], which asserts that relatively minor problems left unattended (such as litter, [[graffiti]], or public urination by [[homeless]] individuals) send a [[subliminal message]] that disorder in general is being tolerated, and as a result, more serious crimes will end up being committed (the analogy being that a broken window left broken shows an image of general dilapidation).

Wilson's theories have been used to justify the implementation of [[zero tolerance]] policies by many prominent American [[mayor]]s, most notably [[Oscar Goodman]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Richard Riordan]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in [[New York City]] and [[Gavin Newsom]] in [[San Francisco]]. Such policies refuse to tolerate even minor crimes; proponents argue that this will improve the quality of life of local residents. However, critics of zero tolerance policies believe that such policies neglect investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes.

====Popsicle index====
The '''popsicle index''' is a quality-of-life measurement coined by [[Catherine Austin Fitts]] as the percentage of people in a community who believe that a child in their community can leave their home alone, go to the nearest possible location to buy a [[ice pop|popsicle]] or other snack, and return home safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solari.com/about/popsicle_index.html|title=Understanding the Popsicle Index|last=Fitts|first=Catherine Austin|work=SolariF|access-date=10 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121002723/https://solari.com/about/popsicle_index.html |archivedate=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133984989.html|title=To lick crime, pass the Popsicle test|date=9 July 2005|work=The Virginian-Pilot|access-date=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sentienttimes.com/06/dec_jan_06/popsicle.html|title=Money in a Popsicle-Friendly World|last=Darling|first=John|date=January 2006|work=Sentient Times|access-date=10 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726124705/http://www.sentienttimes.com/06/dec_jan_06/popsicle.html|archivedate=26 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In healthcare==
{{main | Quality of life (healthcare)}}
Within the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how a certain ailment affects a patient on an individual level.  This may be a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening; life-threatening illness that is not terminal; terminal illness; the predictable, natural decline in the health of an elder; an unforeseen mental/physical decline of a loved one; or chronic, end-stage disease processes. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Quality of Life Research Unit define quality of life as "The degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of his or her life" (UofT).  Their Quality of Life Model is based on the categories "being", "belonging", and "becoming"; respectively who one is, how one is not connected to one's environment, and whether one achieves one's personal goals, hopes, and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Quality of Life: How Good is Life for You? | publisher = University of Toronto Quality of Life Research Unit | url = https://www.utoronto.ca/qol/   | accessdate = 14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualityoflifecare.com/?page_id=50 About QLC : Quality of Life Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international development==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
Quality of life is an important concept in the field of [[international development]] since it allows development to be analyzed on a measure broader than standard of living. Within [[development theory]], however, there are varying ideas concerning what constitutes desirable change for a particular society, and the different ways that quality of life is defined by institutions therefore shapes how these organizations work for its improvement as a whole.

Organisations such as the [[World Bank]], for example, declare a goal of "working for a world free of poverty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The World Bank | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTABOUTUS/Resources/wbgroupbrochure-en.pdf | accessdate = 2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with poverty defined as a lack of basic human needs, such as food, water, shelter, freedom, access to education, healthcare, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Poverty - Overview | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://go.worldbank.org/RQBDCTUXW0 | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, poverty is defined as a low quality of life. Using this definition, the World Bank works towards improving quality of life through the stated goal of lowering poverty and helping people afford a better quality of life.

Other organizations, however, may also work towards improved global quality of life using a slightly different definition and substantially different methods. Many [[NGO]]s do not focus at all on reducing poverty on a national or international scale, but rather attempt to improve quality of life for individuals or communities. One example would be sponsorship programs that provide material aid for specific individuals. Although many organizations of this type may still talk about fighting poverty, the methods are significantly different.

Improving quality of life involves action not only by NGOs but also by [[government]]s. Global health has the potential to achieve greater political presence if governments were to incorporate aspects of human security into [[foreign policy]]. Stressing individuals’ basic rights to health, food, shelter, and freedom addresses prominent inter-sectoral problems negatively impacting today's society and may lead to greater action and resources. Integration of global health concerns into foreign policy may be hampered by approaches that are shaped by the overarching roles of defense and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel and Huish.

'''Real world evidence''' (RWE) in medicine means evidence obtained from [[real world data]] (RWD), which are [[observational data]] obtained outside the context of [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) and generated during routine clinical practice. In order to assess patient outcomes and to ensure that patients get treatment that is right for them, real world data needs to be utilized. RWE is generated by analyzing data which is stored in [[electronic health records]] (EHR), medical claims or billing activities databases, registries, patient-generated data, mobile devices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RealWorldEvidence/default.htm|title=Real World Evidence|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be derived from [[retrospective]] or [[Prospective search|prospective]] [[Observational study|observational studies]] and observational registries. In the USA the [[21st Century Cures Act]] required the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to expand the role of real world evidence.
 
Real World Evidence comes into play when clinical trials cannot really account for the entire patient population of a particular disease. Patients suffering from comorbidities or belonging to a distant geographic region or age limit who did not participate in any clinical trial may not respond to the treatment in question as expected. RWE provides answers to these problems and also to analyze effects of drugs over a longer period of time. Pharmaceutical companies and Health Insurance Payers study RWE to understand patient pathways to deliver appropriate care for appropriate individuals and to minimize their own financial risk by investing on drugs that work for patients.

The relationship between '''religion and divorce''' is complicated and varied. This article attempts to summarize the dominant views in a number of major world faiths.

The great majority of [[Christian denominations]] affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] treats all [[consummate]]d [[Sacraments|sacramental]] marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''Divorce in Christianity'' at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/divorce_1.shtml www.bbc.co.uk] retrieved 17 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian denominations, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and many [[Protestant]] churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In societies that practised [[Puritan]]ism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The [[Church of England]] also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Bible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus taught on the subject of divorce]] in three of the [[Gospels]], and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 7: "Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the [[Pauline privilege]].  He again alludes to his position on divorce in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], albeit an allegory, when he states "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress" (Romans 7:2-3).

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:31-32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1-10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1-5|KJV}}, Jesus came into conflict with the [[Pharisees]] over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] about {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:1-4|KJV}}—as evidenced in [[Nashim]] Gittin 9:10 of the [[Mishnah]]. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings [[Judaizers]]? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus [[Antinomianism|opposed the Law of Moses]] or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a [[Jewish Christians|Jewish audience]] or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example "all nations" as in the [[Great Commission]].    
Since Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See ''[[Agunah]]''), did Jesus' answers "in the house" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as [[Herodias]] who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:3-4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:10-12|KJV}}.) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula [[Expounding of the Law|"You have heard...But I say to you"]] in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:20-48|KJV}}? Expressions used by Jesus such as "you have heard", "it hath been said", "it is written", "have you never read", "keep the commandments", "why do you break the commandments with your traditions?" and "what did Moses Command you?" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and sometimes opposed [[Oral law|Pharisaical Opinions]]. He was [[Woes of the Pharisees|critical of the Pharisees]].

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see [[Buddhist view of marriage]]). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.

==Islam==
{{main|Divorce in Islam}}
{{See also|Sharia}}

According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

==Judaism==
[[Judaism]] has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one: e.g., see [[Deuteronomy]] chapters 22 and 24.  Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that ''[[shalom bayit]]'' (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm Judaism 101/divorce]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorcement, called a [[get (divorce document)|get]], which also acts as proof of the divorce. From ancient times, the get was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a [[mamzer]], to be avoided at any cost. Also, the woman would be committing [[adultery]] should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called '''Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom''' (literally, the proscription of [[Gershom ben Judah#Synod and bans|Rabbenu Gershom]])--accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities—prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"], ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish law divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the ''get'' or for the wife to accept the ''get''. But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the ''get''.

Jewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. In the first place, as noted above, if both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In the second place, if either party does not wish to continue co-habiting with the other is sufficient [[grounds for divorce]]. (Anything else, it is said, would amount to rape of the woman.) In this sense it is a "no-fault" approach to divorce. This approach has been accepted for thousands of years {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. It was the approach advocated by followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], a very influential school of thought in ancient [[Judea]], which predated the current era. This is the approach which is now generally accepted in most, if not all, Jewish communities around the world.

On the other hand, the refusal of a husband to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]] (the document) can be for purely vindictive or even extortion motives. This situation has resulted in numerous social problems in modern times. For example, where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, appropriate provisions may be made to compel the giving of the get by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. A woman who has been refused a get is typically referred to as an "[[agunah]]".

A wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life).  However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her. Also see ''Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce''.&lt;ref&gt;

and [[Get (conflict)|Get in the Conflict of Laws]].

Furthermore, from the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God).  Because of the danger of the birth of illegitimate children ([[mamzer]]im) if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.

In some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named [[Lilith]] who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the  8th-10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]''. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.

===Greek mythology===

After finding he intended to marry [[Glauce]]; for what Jason said was political ties; [[Medea]] murdered Glauce and her father with a burning dress; than proceeded to kill her own children Tisander and Alcimenes fearing they would be imprisoned. Afterwords she left to [[Athens]] on a chariot of dragons given to her by her grandfather Helios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca===
The [[Wicca]]n equivalent of a divorce is described as a ''handparting''. Wiccans traditionally see either a high priest or high priestess to discuss things out before a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A Handbook for Wiccan Clergy - Page 60, Kevin M. Gardner - 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However a handfasting (marriage) that falls apart peacefully does not necessarily need a handparting.&lt;ref&gt;All One Wicca: A Study in the Universal Eclectic Tradition of Wicca - Page 110, Kaatryn MacMorgan - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarian Universalism===
In [[Unitarian Universalism]], divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage. Such divorces have sometimes taken the form of divorce rituals as far back as the 1960s. Divorces are largely seen as a life choice.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground? Robyn E Lebron - 2012 Page 571&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scar''' is an area of [[fibrosis|fibrous tissue]] that replaces normal [[skin]] after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of [[wound]] repair in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.

Scar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.&lt;ref name="collagenskinscar2010-08-20"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition.

For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation]], and [[sweat gland]]s and [[hair follicle]]s do not grow back within scar tissues.&lt;ref name=Kraftlynde/&gt; A [[myocardial infarction]], commonly known as a heart attack,  causes [[Myocardial scarring|scar formation]] in the [[heart]] muscle, which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly [[heart failure]]. However, there are some tissues (e.g. [[bone]]) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration.

All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.&lt;ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/&gt; Scar tissue also lacks elasticity&lt;ref name=elasticFibersScars&gt;{{cite book | last = A.

Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and [[keloid]] scarring,&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt; both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kelly AP | title = Update on the Management of Keloids | journal = Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–76 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608056 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypertrophic ===
{{main|Hypertrophic scars}}
[[Hypertrophic scars]] occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. [[Organ hypertrophy|Hypertrophic]] scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gauglitz GG, Korting HC, Pavicic T, Ruzicka T, Jeschke MG | title = Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies | journal = Mol Med | volume = 17 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 113–125 | date = January–February 2011 | pmid = 20927486 | pmc = 3022978 | doi = 10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 | url = http://www.molmed.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keloid===
{{Main|Keloid}}
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|Keloid scarring following persistent whipping. People with darker skin pigmentation are more prone to the development of keloid scarring.]]
Keloid scars are a more serious form of excessive scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) [[neoplasm]]s.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt;

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.&lt;ref name="Roseborough2004a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC | title = Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring | journal = J Natl Med Assoc | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14746360 | pmc = 2594768 | doi =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.&lt;ref&gt;Martini, Frederic H. (2006). ''Fundamentals of Anatomy &amp; Physiology,'' Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be caused by surgery, accident, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or, sometimes, [[body piercings]]. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the [[shoulder]]s and [[chest]]. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=secinten201104/&gt; Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.

=== Atrophic ===
An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as [[fat]] or [[muscle]], are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman GJ | title = Postacne scarring: A review of its pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 857–871 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10971560 | doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2000.99232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabbrocini G, Annunziata MC, D'Arco V, De Vita V, Lodi G, Mauriello MC, Pastore F, Monfrecola G | title = Acne Scars: Pathogenesis, Classification and Treatment | journal = Dermatology Research and Practice | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20981308 | pmc = 2958495 | doi = 10.1155/2010/893080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chickenpox]], other diseases (especially ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic [[connective tissue]] disorder, such as [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes#H35121407|title=Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretch marks ===
{{Main|Stretch marks}}
Stretch marks (technically called ''striae'') are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during [[pregnancy]],&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Young | first1 = G. | last2 = Jewell | first2 = D. | title = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD000066 | year = 1996 | pmid =  10796111| pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000066 | chapter = Creams for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy | editor1-first = Gavin | editor1-last = Young }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152199|date = October 2018}} significant weight gain, or adolescent [[growth spurt]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Baumann LS, Elsaaiee LT | title = Striae Distensae (Stretch Marks) and Different Modalities of Therapy: An Update | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–573 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19400881 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2009.01094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near [[joints]]). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"/&gt;

Elevated [[corticosteroid]] levels are implicated in striae development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hengge UR, Ruzicka T, Schwartz RA, Cork MJ | title = Adverse effects of topical glucocorticosteroids | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16384751 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Umbilical ===
Humans and other [[List of placental mammals|placental mammals]] have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as to a [[navel]]) which starts to heal when the [[umbilical cord]] is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;"What Types of Animals Have Been to Space and More Questions From our Readers", Smithsonian Magazine May 2012, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-types-of-animals-have-been-to-space-and-more-questions-from-our-readers-63029589/ Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii), US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/Documents/Redbook/Flat-Tailed%20Horned%20Lizard%20RB.pdf Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Scar.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hypertrophic scar]]ring one year after [[road rash]] on the right, and the original wound on the left.]]

A scar is the product of the body's repair mechanism after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form.&lt;ref name=bursurg&gt;{{Cite web| title = POST BURN SCAR RELATIVE TO RE-EPITHELIALIZATION| publisher = eplasty.com| year = 2011| url = http://eplasty.com/images/PDF/ManageBurnWound-part4.pdf| quote = Healing in 2 weeks – minimal to no scar; Healing in 3 weeks – minimal to no scar except in high risk scar formers;Healing in 4 weeks or more – hypertrophic in more than 50% of patients| accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the extracellular matrix senses elevated mechanical stress loading, tissue will scar,&lt;ref name=scarStress2011/&gt; and scars can be limited by stress shielding wounds.&lt;ref name=scarStress2011&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15350879| title = Pushing Back: Wound Mechanotransduction in Repair and Regeneration| last = Victor W.Wong, SatoshiAkaishi, Michael T.Longaker, Geoffrey C.Gurtner | date = | year = 2011| website = sciencedirect.com| publisher = Journal of Investigative Dermatology| access-date = 17 October 2018| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast and heal scar free.&lt;ref name=myoscar201103/&gt;&lt;ref name=smallWound&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tam |first1=Joshua |last2=Wang |first2=Ying |last3=Vuong |first3=Linh N. |last4=Fisher |first4=Jeremy M. |last5=Farinelli |first5=William A. |last6=Anderson |first6=R.

The [[endometrium]], the inner lining of the uterus, is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic shedding and regeneration without scarring; shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7-day window on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=Scrrpr2012918&gt;{{cite web| title = Endometrial repair| quote = Importantly, the endometrium is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic repair without scarring.| publisher = princehenrys.org| date = 18 September 2012 | url = http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| accessdate = 30 June 2013| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090914010721/http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.

Prolonged [[inflammation]], as well as the [[fibroblast]] proliferation&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar, and is generally not permanent (see [[wound healing]]). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Skin scars occur when the [[dermis]] (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original [[injury]] that caused them. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Wounds allowed to heal secondarily tend to scar worse than wounds from primary closure.&lt;ref name=secinten201104&gt;{{Cite web | title = Practical Plastic Surgery for Nonsurgeons - Secondary Wound Closure - Scarring | quote = Wounds that are allowed to heal secondarily tend to have larger and more noticeable scars than the scars that results from primary closure.

===Collagen synthesis===
Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.

====Fibroblasts====
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation,&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.&lt;ref name =Fibroblasts2007-12-17&gt;{{Cite web| last = Parlange| first = Mary | title = New mechanical insights into wound healing and scar tissue formation| quote = The body launches a complex rescue operation.

The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing.

=== Chemical peels ===
Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for acne surgery | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | issue =  | pages = S28–36 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688101 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=28;epage=36;aulast=Khunger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to [[keloid]] formation or with active infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for chemical peels | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | issue =  | pages = S5–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688104 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=5;epage=12;aulast=Khunger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filler injections ===
Filler injections of [[collagen]] can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper JS, Lee BT | title = Treatment of facial scarring: lasers, filler, and nonoperative techniques | journal = Facial Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–5 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20024872 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1243079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and [[allergic reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemperle G, Rullan PP, Gauthier-Hazan N | title = Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 92S–107S | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936549 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000234672.69287.77 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4t0019d6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser treatment ===
Nonablative lasers, such as the 585&amp;nbsp;nm [[pulsed dye laser]], 1064&amp;nbsp;nm and 1320&amp;nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG]], or the 1540&amp;nbsp;nm [[Er:Glass]] are used as laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.&lt;ref name="pmid21061757"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Choudhary S | title = Lasers for scars: a review and evidence-based appraisal | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1355–62 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21061757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For burn scars they improve the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willows|first1=BM|last2=Ilyas|first2=M|last3=Sharma|first3=A|title=Laser in the management of burn scars.|journal=Burns |date=4 August 2017|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2017.07.001|pmid=28784339|volume=43|issue=7|pages=1379–1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ablative lasers such as the [[carbon dioxide laser]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[Er:YAG]] offer the best results for atrophic and acne scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khatri KA, Mahoney DL, McCartney MJ | title = Laser scar revision: A review | journal = Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 54–62 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21401378 | doi = 10.3109/14764172.2011.564625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like dermabrasion, ablative lasers work by destroying the epidermis to a certain depth. Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.&lt;ref name="pmid21061757"/&gt;

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial [[radiotherapy]] is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. It is thought to be effective despite a lack of clinical trials, but only used in extreme cases due to the perceived risk of long-term side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogawa R, Yoshitatsu S, Yoshida K, Miyashita T | title = Is radiation therapy for keloids acceptable? The risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 1196–201 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19935303 | doi = 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181b5a3ae }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dressing===
Silicone scar treatments are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stavrou D, Weissman O, Winkler E, Yankelson L, Millet E, Mushin OP, Liran A, Haik J | title = Silicone-based scar therapy: a review of the literature | journal = Aesthetic Plastic Surgery | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 646–51 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20354695 | doi = 10.1007/s00266-010-9496-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-study by the Cochrane collaboration found weak evidence that silicone gel sheeting helps prevent scarring.&lt;ref name=Ob2013/&gt; However, the studies examining it were of poor quality and susceptible to bias.&lt;ref name=Ob2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=L|last2=Jones|first2=DJ|title=Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD003826|pmid=24030657|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003826.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure dressing]]s are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking.&lt;ref name=Shih2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shih R, Waltzman J, Evans GR | title = Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 1091–5 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17312518 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000255814.75012.35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt; The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt;

=== Steroids ===
A long-term course of [[corticosteroid]] injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roques C, Téot L | title = The Use of Corticosteroids to Treat Keloids: A Review | journal = The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18611924 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1177/1534734608320786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topical steroids are ineffective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jenkins M, Alexander JW, MacMillan BG, Waymack JP, Kopcha R. Failure of topical steroids and vitamin E to reduce postoperative scar formation following reconstructive surgery. J Burn Care Rehabil. 1986 Jul–Aug;7(4):309–312.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[clobetasol propionate]] can be used as an alternative treatment for keloid scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=A Randomized, Single-Blind Trial of Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% Cream Under Silicone Dressing Occlusion Versus Intra-Lesional Triamcinolone for Treatment of Keloid | journal=Clinical Drug Investigation | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=295–301 | date=2016-11-25 | pmid=27888448 | last1=Nor | first1=N.

=== Surgery ===
[[File:scar revision.jpg|right|thumb|Scarring caused by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] (left), and photo one day after scar revision surgery: The area around sutures is still swollen from surgery.]]

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by [[primary intention]], instead of [[secondary intention]]. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.&lt;ref name=scarrevision2010&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Scar revisions  | quote = Deep cuts need multi-layered closure to heal optimally; otherwise, depressed or dented scars can result  | url = http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | accessdate = 16 October 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119050557/http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | archive-date = 19 January 2012  | dead-url = yes  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

''Subcision'' is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe [[glabella]] lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peel]]s can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt; Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Farris PK. Topical vitamin C: a useful agent for treating photoaging and other dermatologic conditions. Although many people claim that vitamin therapy does in fact help. Dermatol Surg 2005;31:814-818.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*Cosmetics; Medical makeup can temporarily conceal scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical Makeup for Concealing Facial Scars|url = http://pubs.bli.uci.edu/sites/default/files/publications/s-0032-1325647.pdf|journal = Facial Plastic Surgery|date = 2012-10-01|pages = 536–540|volume = 28|issue = 5|doi = 10.1055/s-0032-1325647|language = en|first = Donna|last = Mee|first2 = Brian|last2 = Wong|pmid=23027221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly used for [[Face|facial]] scars.
*[[Dermabrasion]] involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a [[local anaesthetic]].

==Society and culture==

=== Intentional scarring ===
{{main|Scarification}}
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of [[body art]] within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

===Etymology===
First attested in English in the late 14th century, the word ''scar'' derives from a conflation of [[Old French]] ''escharre'', from [[Late Latin]] ''eschara'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deschara eschara], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐσχάρα (''eskhara''), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29sxa%2Fra ἐσχάρα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Middle English]] ''skar'' ("cut, crack, incision"), which is from [[Old Norse]] ''skarð'' ("notch, gap"). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;. The conflation helped to form the English meaning. Compare [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] for evolution of ''skarð'' to ''scar''.

==Research==
An intradermal injection of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed were published in the ''Lancet'' along with an editorial commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Renovo. [http://www.renovo.com/en/news/lancet-publication]. Lancet trials in: 11 April 2009 (vol. 373, pages 1264-1274). Lancet commentary by Edward Tredget in: vol 373, pages 1226-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

A study implicated the protein [[ribosomal s6 kinase]] (RSK) in the formation of scar tissue and found the introduction of a chemical to counteract RSK could halt the formation of [[cirrhosis]].  This treatment also has the potential to reduce or even prevent altogether other types of scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liver damage 'could be reversed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7152415.stm |date=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also implicated [[osteopontin]] in scarring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/205/1/43 'Molecular mechanisms linking wound inflammation and fibrosis: knockdown of osteopontin leads to rapid repair and reduced scarring']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7199897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gel 'to speed up wound healing' | date=22 January 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physical examination.jpg|thumb|A medical examination]]
Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for.

[[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

==Introduction==
In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of prayer are done, the issue of prayer's efficacy may be further clarified.&lt;ref name="WashPostOne"&gt;Boorstein, Michelle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third party studies discussed here have all been performed using Christian prayers. Some have reported [[null results]], some have reported correlations between prayer and health, and some have reported contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery.

==Studies==

===Galton===
In 1872, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scientist [[Francis Galton]] made the first [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of third-party prayer. He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer were effective, members of the [[British Royal Family]] would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well-being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see whether the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case.&lt;ref name="galton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawkins"/&gt;

===Byrd and Harris===
A 1988 study by Randolph C. Byrd used 393 patients at the [[San Francisco General Hospital]] [[Coronary care unit|coronary care unit (CCU)]]. Measuring 29 health outcomes using three-level (good, intermediate, or bad) scoring, the prayer group suffered fewer newly diagnosed ailments on only six of them. Byrd concluded that "Based on these data there seemed to be an effect, and that effect was presumed to be beneficial", and that "intercessory prayer to the Judeo-Christian God has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU."&lt;ref name="Byrd"/&gt; The reaction from the scientific community concerning this study was mixed. Several reviewers considered Byrd’s study to be well-designed and well-executed,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain and Hall 2001, 34&lt;/ref&gt; while others  remained skeptical.  A criticism of Byrd's study, which also applies to most other studies, is the fact that he did not limit prayers by the friends and family of patients, hence it is unclear which prayers, if any, may have been measured.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The Byrd study had an inconsistent pattern of only six positive outcomes amongst 26 specific problem conditions. A systematic review suggested this indicates possible [[Type I and type II errors|Type I]] errors.&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

A 1999 follow-up by William S. Harris et al. attempted to replicate Byrd's findings under stricter experimental conditions, noting that the original research was not completely blinded and was limited to only "prayer-receptive" individuals (57 of the 450 patients invited to participate in the study refused to give consent "for personal reasons or religious convictions").&lt;ref name="HarrisGowdaKolb"/&gt;  Using a different, continuous weighted scoring system – which admittedly was, like Byrd's scoring, "an unvalidated measure of CCU outcomes" – Harris et al. concluded that "supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients", and suggested that "prayer be an
effective adjunct to standard medical care."&lt;ref&gt;Harris et al. 1999, 2273&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when they applied Byrd’s scores to their data, they could not document an effect of prayer using his scoring method. Critics have suggested that both Byrd's and Harris's results can be explained by chance.&lt;ref name="Tessman"/&gt; Richard P. Sloan compared the Byrd and Harris studies with the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy|sharpshooter fallacy]], "searching through the data until a significant effect is found, then drawing the bull's-eye."&lt;ref name="Sloan"/&gt;

===O'Laoire===
A 1997 study by O'Laoire measured the effects on the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits not only for the beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This study used beneficiary names as well as photographs.&lt;ref name="OLaoire"/&gt;

===Sicher===
In 1998 Fred Sicher et al. performed a small scale double-blind randomized study of 40 patients with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicher|first=F|author2=Targ, E|author3= Moore D, 2nd |author4=Smith, HS|title=A randomized double-blind study of the effect of distant healing in a population with advanced AIDS. Report of a small scale study.|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=December 1998|volume=169|issue=6|pages=356–63|pmid=9866433|pmc=1305403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake112 &gt;''Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care'' by James Lake 2006 {{ISBN|1-58890-299-4}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were in category C-3 with [[CD4]] cell counts below 200 and each had at least one case of AIDS-defining illness.&lt;ref name=Scott259 &gt;''Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health'' edited by Scott Shannon 2001 Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-638281-6}} page 259&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were randomly assigned to receive distant intercessory healing or none at all. The intercession took place by people in different parts of the United States who never had any contact with the patients. Both patients and physicians were blind to who received or did not receive intercession.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt; Six months later the prayer group had significantly fewer AIDS illnesses, less frequent doctor visits, and fewer days in the hospital.&lt;ref name=Lake112 /&gt; However, CD4 counts and scores on other [[physiology|physiological]] tests had no significant variation between the two groups of patients.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt;

===Mayo clinic===
A 2001 double-blind study at the [[Mayo Clinic]] randomized 799 discharged coronary surgery patients into a [[Scientific control|control]] group and an intercessory prayer group, which received prayers at least once a week from 5 intercessors per patient. Analyzing "primary end points" (death, cardiac arrest, rehospitalization, etc.) after 26 weeks, the researchers concluded "intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit."&lt;ref name="AvilesWhelanHernke"/&gt;

===The IVF-ET prayer scandal===
In 2001 the ''Journal of Reproductive Medicine'' published an experimental study by three [[Columbia University]] researchers indicating that prayer for women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]]-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) resulted in a success rate (50%) of [[pregnancy]] double that of women who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="ChaWirthLobo"/&gt; [[Columbia University]] issued a news release saying that the study had been carefully designed to eliminate [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;  The most vocal [[skeptic]] was [[Bruce Flamm]], a clinical professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the [[University of california|University of California at Irvine]], who found that the experimental procedures were flawed.&lt;ref name="FlammOne"/&gt;  One of the study's authors, Cha, responded to criticism of the study in the November 2004 issue of JRM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=21868&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, the [[DHHS|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS)]] office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) confirmed a report by the Columbia University Health Sciences Division that one of the study’s authors, Rogerio Lobo, only learned of the study six to twelve months after the study was completed, and that he had only provided editorial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/dec01f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The name of [[Columbia University]] and Lobo were retracted from the study.&lt;ref name="FlammThree"/&gt;

===Retroactive intercessory prayer===
A 2001 study by Leonard Leibovici used records of 3,393 patients who had developed blood infections at the [[Rabin Medical Center]] between 1990 and 1996 to study ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer.&lt;ref name="Leibovici"/&gt;  To compound the alleged miraculous power of prayer itself, the prayers were performed ''after'' the patients had already left the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]]. All 3,393 patients were those in the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]] between 1990 and 1996, and the prayers were conducted in 2000. Two of the outcomes, length of stay in the hospital and duration of fever, were found to be significantly improved in the intervention group, implying that prayer can even change events ''in the past.'' However, the "[[mortality rate]] was lower in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant."  Leibovici concluded that "Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was associated with a shorter stay in hospital and a shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream infection." Leibovici goes on to note that in the past, people knew the way to prevent diseases (he cites scurvy) without understanding why it worked.  In saying so, he suggests that if prayer truly does have a positive effect on patients in hospital, then there may be a naturalist explanation for it that we do not yet understand.  After many scientists and scholars criticized this retroactive study,&lt;ref name="Thornett"/&gt; Leibovici stated in 2002 that the "article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials."&lt;ref name = Lighthearted /&gt;  The study has been summarised as being "intended lightheartedly to illustrate the importance of asking research questions that fit with scientific models."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;

In 2003, [[Larry Dossey]], the [[executive editor]] of the journal ''[[Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing]]'' and an advocate of [[faith healing]]&lt;ref name = Gorski /&gt; co-authored a paper responding to Leibovici which discussed possible mechanisms to explain the results reported.&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey invoked quantum mechanics to explain not only the benefits of intercessory prayer, but also how it might operate retroactively,&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt; drawing strong criticisms from physicist [[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]] and physician [[Jeffrey Bishop]].&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt; The [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] is regularly used to suggest that conscious control of physical reality is predicted by quantum mechanics, but this misconception "can be traced to a misinterpretation of [[particle-wave duality|wave-particle duality]]."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  In relation to [[backwards causation|backwards causality]], Stenger noted that "the results of some quantum experiments may be interpreted as evidence for events in the future affecting events in the past at the quantum level, [but] no theoretical basis exists for applying this notion on the macroscopic scale of human experience."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  He concluded that while "the atoms in biological systems are quantum in nature ... their collective behaviour does not exhibit any quantum effects. ... What is more, even if the brain were a quantum system, that would not imply that it can break the laws of physics any more than electrons or photons, which are inarguably quanta."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  One further point which illustrates that Dossey and Olshansky do not understand the physics they are using is seen in their invocation of [[quantum nonlocality]] in explaining backward causation, stating that "[r]etroactive prayer may be less absurd than [Leibovici] supposes, in the light of the discovery of non-local phenomena."&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Unfortunately, the two are mutually incompatible: in allowing reverse causality in a model, the phenomenon of nonlocality ceases.&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  Dossey has written in ''Explore'' about coining the term "nonlocal mind" in 1987,&lt;ref name = Nonlocal /&gt; though quantum nonlocality goes back to a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]].&lt;ref name = EPR /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey defended their work from various critics in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'s rapid response section&lt;ref name = ODrespond /&gt;

Olensky and Dossey are not alone amongst alternative medicine proponents in having missed the point which Leibovici was making.  In 2004, Stephen Wright described the Olshansky and Dossey contribution as a "thoughtful essay,"&lt;ref name = Wright /&gt; and it was praised by an editorial in the ''[[Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name = Jobst /&gt;  In 2005, Olshansky and Dossey's work was included in a critical review published in ''Explore'' which concluded that "Religious activity may improve health outcomes."&lt;ref name = ExploreCritReview /&gt;  Their work was also defended in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' itself in 2004.&lt;ref name = BMJdefender /&gt;  Dossey authored an ''Explore'' paper defending experiments on the medical effects of prayer in 2005.&lt;ref name = Twenty /&gt;

===The MANTRA study===
A 2005 MANTRA (Monitoring and Actualisation of [[Noetic theory|Noetic]] Trainings) II study conducted a three-year clinical trial led by [[Duke University]] comparing intercessory prayer and MIT (Music, Imagery, and Touch) therapies for 748 cardiology patients. The study is regarded as the first time rigorous scientific protocols were applied on a large scale to assess the feasibility of intercessory prayer and other healing practices. The study produced null results and the authors concluded, "Neither masked prayer nor MIT therapy significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention."&lt;ref name="KrucoffCraterGallup"/&gt;  Neither study specified whether photographs were used or whether belief levels were measured in the agents or those performing the prayers.

===The STEP project===
Harvard professor [[Herbert Benson]] performed a "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" in 2006.&lt;ref name="STEP"/&gt;  The STEP, commonly called the "[[Templeton Foundation]] prayer study" or "Great Prayer Experiment", used 1,802 [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] patients at six hospitals. Using [[double-blind]] protocols, patients were [[randomize]]d into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they might or might not receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic effects]], was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. The congregations of three [[local church|Christian churches]] who prayed for the patients "were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications".&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;  Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. [[Complication (medicine)|Complications]] of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In ''[[The God Delusion]],'' [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: [[performance anxiety]]', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, "It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'"&lt;ref name=DelusionQuote&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Great Prayer Experiment | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=god%20delusion&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | author=Richard Dawkins | title=[[The God Delusion]] | year=2006 | pages=87–88 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Jeffery Dusek stated that: "Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done.  The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations."&lt;ref name="HarvardNewsRel"/&gt;  Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers.&lt;ref name="HarvardGazette"/&gt;

==Literature reviews==
A [[meta-analysis]] of several studies related to distant intercessory healing was published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=astin &gt;John A. Astin, et al. ''The Efficacy of "Distant Healing" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials'' [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 [http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyzed 23 trials of 2,774 patients. Five of the trials were for prayer as the distant healing method, 11 were with noncontact touch, and 7 were other forms. Of these trials, 13 showed statistically significant beneficial treatment results, 9 showed no effect, and 1 showed a negative result. The authors concluded that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding distant healing and suggested further studies.&lt;ref name=astin /&gt;

A 2003 [[levels of evidence]] review found "some" evidence for the hypothesis that "Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness".&lt;ref name="PowellShahabiThoresen"/&gt;  It concluded that although "a number of studies" have tested this hypothesis, "only three have sufficient rigor for review here" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, "the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively. This raises concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes assessors. Moreover, the absence of a clearly plausible biological mechanism by which such a treatment could influence hard medical outcome results in the inclination to be skeptical of results." This 2003 review was performed before the 2005 MANTRA study and the 2006 STEP project, neither of which were conclusive in establishing the efficacy of prayer.

Various broader meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that "There is no scientifically discernable effect for intercessory prayer as assessed in controlled studies".&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;K. Masters, G. Spielmans, J. Goodson "Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review." ''[[Annals of Behavioral Medicine]]'' 2006 Aug;32(1):21-6. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16827626]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2007 systemic review of 17 intercessory prayer studies found "small, but significant, effect sizes for the use of intercessory prayer" in 7 studies, but "prayer was unassociated with positive improvement in the condition of client" in the other 10, concluding that based upon the [[American Psychology Association]]'s Division 12 ([[clinical psychology]]) criteria for evidence-based practice, intercessory prayer "must be classified as an experimental intervention." The review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies had failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=DRHodge&gt;David R. Hodge, "A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature on Intercessory Prayer" in ''Research on Social Work Practice'' March 2007 vol. 17 no. 2 174-187 {{doi|10.1177/1049731506296170}} [http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract Article abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202025826/http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract |date=2011-12-02 }} [http://www.sagepub.com/vaughnstudy/articles/intervention/Hodge.pdf Full length article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Unwarranted variation (or geographic variation) in health care service delivery refers to differences that cannot be explained by illness, medical need, or the dictates of evidence-based medicine. The term was coined by Dr. [[John Wennberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_22/b3986001.htm Medical Guesswork] Businessweek.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105163103/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_22/b3986001.htm |date=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2017}}  
It can be caused by shortfalls in three areas:

* Effective care and patient safety, which includes services of proven clinical effectiveness, such as using [[lipid-lowering agent]]s in patients with coronary artery disease
* Preference-sensitive treatments, treatment for conditions that have trade-offs in terms of risks and benefits for the patient, though the choice of care should be driven by the patient's preferences
* Supply-sensitive care, which is strongly correlated with healthcare system resource capacity and generally provided in the absence of medical evidence and clinical theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthdialog.com/hd/Core/Analytics/UnwarrantedVariation.htm Unwarranted Variation] Health Dialog, healthdialog.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211043616/http://www.healthdialog.com/hd/Core/Analytics/UnwarrantedVariation.htm |date=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, while working in the Regional Medical Program{{clarify|date=October 2015}} created with a $350,000 grant from President [[Lyndon Johnson]],  Wennberg analyzed Medicare data to determine how well hospitals and doctors were serving their communities. He found 4 types of variation: the underuse of effective care, variations in outcomes attributable to the quality of care, the misuse of preference-sensitive treatments and overuse of supply-sensitive services.&lt;ref name="managedhealthcareexecutive.com"&gt;Michael T. McCue [http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 Clamping down on variation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218052952/http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 |date=2007-12-18 }} - Managed Healthcare Executive, February 01, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Health Dialog, a privately held, for-profit disease-management company which was established to address unwarranted variation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you live in northern Idaho, and you develop back pain, chances are good that you’ll undergo surgery to treat your pain. Move to the southern tip of Texas, however, and the chances that you’ll undergo that same surgery will drop by a factor of 6. The surgery is no more effective in Idaho than it is in Texas. It’s just that doctors in the northwest are more likely than those in southern Texas to recommend surgery. This phenomenon, in which doctors practice medicine differently depending on where they’re from, is called practice pattern variation. And it isn’t limited to treating back pain, or even surgical decisions. There is also variation in treatment for chronic conditions, such as use of beta blockers for individuals with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) or lipid testing for those with diabetes.&lt;ref name="Healthcare 1999"&gt;The Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Wennberg and colleagues at the Dartmouth Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences documented these wide variations in how healthcare is practiced around the United States. They have asserted that most of this variation is unwarranted. [[Health Dialog]] was built to address unwarranted variation in healthcare: the overuse, underuse and misuse of medical care. Wennberg and his colleagues concluded that if unwarranted variation in the US healthcare system could be reduced, the quality of care would go up and healthcare costs would go down. Studies have shown that if unwarranted variation could be reduced in the Medicare population, quality of care would rise dramatically and costs could be lowered by as much as 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher E.S., Wennberg D.E., Stukel T.A., et al. The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending. Part 1. Ann Intern Med. 2003; 138: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Extent==
Unwarranted variation in medical practice is costly and deadly as noted by Martin Sipkoff in ''9 Ways To Reduce Unwarranted Variation''. Analysis of Medicare data revealed that per-capita spending per enrollee in Miami was almost 2.5 times as much as in Minneapolis, even after adjusting data for age, sex, and race. According to a 2003 report from the National Committee for Quality Assurance 57,000 lives were lost annually because US physicians have not been using evidence-based medicine to guide their care.&lt;ref name=9ways&gt;[http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0311/0311.variation.html 9 Ways To Reduce Unwarranted Variation] Managed Care Magazine, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

"We're literally dying, waiting for the practice of medicine to catch up with medical knowledge," said Margaret O'Kane, president of NCQA. The report, "The State of Health Care Quality 2003," says that the deaths "should not be confused with those attributable to medical errors or lack of access to health care. This report shows that a thousand Americans die each week because the care they get is not consistent with the care that medical science tells us they should get."&lt;ref name=9ways /&gt;

===United States===
Studies show that individuals with diabetes should have blood lipids monitored regularly, yet patients in [[Chicago]] are 50% less likely to receive these tests than patients in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. A patient with heart disease in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], is three times more likely to have bypass surgery than a similar patient in [[Albuquerque]]. In [[Miami]], where medical services are abundant, Medicare pays more than twice as much per person per year as it does in [[Minneapolis]], with no discernible difference in overall health or life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Healthcare 1999"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

===NHS England===
In November 2010 the Department of Health QIPP Right Care programme published the first NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare, inspired by the work of Wennberg.&lt;ref name=nhs&gt;[http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/atlas/atlas-of-variation-2010/ The NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare] NHS, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; clinicians selected 34 topics,  as being important to their speciality, which were mapped by [[Primary Care Trust]] area, then the healthcare commissioning body. The Atlas was published to challenge commissioners to maximise health outcome and minimise inequalities by addressing unwarranted variation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Awareness is the first important step in identifying and addressing unwarranted variation; if the existence of variation is unknown, the debate about whether it is unwarranted cannot take place."&lt;ref name=nhs/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2010 Atlas revealed widespread variations in outcome, quality, cost and activity:
* A twofold variation among strategic health authorities in the incidence of major amputations per 1000 patients with registered Type 2 diabetes and a fivefold variation in the percentage of people with diabetes receiving the NICE recommended nine key care processes
* A fourfold variation in directly-standardised rate of elective admissions in persons diagnosed with epilepsy per 100,000 population
* A threefold variation in the percentage of patients admitted to hospital who spend 90% of their time on a stroke unit
* A fourfold variation in emergency asthma admissions for children and young adults
* A sixfold variation in provision of hip replacement per 1,000 people in need
* A twofold variation in cancer inpatient expenditure per 1,000 population

A further extended Atlas was published in November 2011, mapping variation across 71 indicators and a follow-on series of Atlases focussing on specific themes in more depth like children and young people, diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory disease.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
A forthcoming atlas will be about liver disease, diagnostics, organ donation and transplantation. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
Publication of the Atlases has been well-received within the NHS and by patient groups and clinical societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
 
In 2012, the British Department of Health published a mandate for the new NHS Commissioning Board. On variation in healthcare, the Mandate charged the Board with the responsibility to "shine a light on variation" and "to make significant progress... in reducing unjustified variation... Success will be measured not only by the average level of improvement but also by progress in reducing health inequalities and unjustified variation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mandate.dh.gov.uk/ The Mandate: A mandate from the Government to the NHS Commissioning Board] April 2013 to March 2015, Department of Health, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7,13,27}}

===Nursing, midwifery and care staff framework, England===
In April 2016, Jane Cummings, Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) for England, launched a national strategic framework for nurses, midwives and care staff in England called Leading Change, Adding Value. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nursing-framework.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This framework sets out the 10 commitments for nurses, midwives and care staff in England towards identifying and addressing unwarranted variation in care practice. The framework builds on the previous CNO strategy 'Compassion in Practice'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/compassion-in-practice.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies the nursing, midwifery and care staff approach to meeting the triple aims of 'improving health outcomes, reducing the care quality gap and effective use of resources' as set out in the Department of Health's Five Year Forward View.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actions to address unwarranted variation in nursing, midwifery and care provision are underpinned by the values of the 6cs,{{clarification needed|date=November 2017}} and a skills and knowledge framework is being developed to support staff in delivering on the 10 commitments set out in the framework.

The '''uterus''' (from [[Latin]] "uterus", plural ''uteri'') or '''womb''' is a major female hormone-responsive [[sex organ |secondary sex organ]] of the [[reproductive system]] in [[human]]s and most other [[mammal]]s. In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the [[cervix]], opens into the [[vagina]], while the upper end, the fundus, is connected to the [[fallopian tubes]]. It is within the uterus that the [[fetus]] develops during [[gestation]]. In the [[human embryogenesis|human embryo]], the uterus develops from the [[paramesonephric duct]]s which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a [[Uterine malformation|duplex uterus]].

In English, the term ''[[wikt:uterus|uterus]]'' is used consistently within the medical and related professions, while the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-derived term ''[[wikt:womb|womb]]'' is also commonly used in everyday contexts.

== Structure == 
The uterus is located within the [[pelvis|pelvic region]] immediately behind and almost overlying the [[urinary bladder|bladder]], and in front of the [[sigmoid colon]]. The human uterus is pear-shaped and about {{Convert|7.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad (side to side), and {{Convert|3.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Manual of Obstetrics.

The uterus can be divided anatomically into four regions: The '''fundus''' – the uppermost rounded portion of the uterus, the corpus (body), the [[cervix]] and the [[cervical canal]]. The cervix protrudes into the [[vagina]]. The uterus is held in position within the pelvis by ligaments, which are called endopelvic fascia. These ligaments include the pubocervical, transverse cervical ligaments or [[cardinal ligaments]], and the [[uterosacral ligaments]].  It is covered by a sheet-like fold of peritoneum, the  [[broad ligament]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray's Anatomy for Students, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The uterus has three layers, which together form the ''uterine wall''. From innermost to outermost, these layers are as follows:
; [[Endometrium]]: is the inner epithelial layer, along with its [[mucous membrane]], of the [[mammal]]ian uterus.  It has a basal layer and a functional layer; the functional layer thickens and then is sloughed during the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[estrous cycle]].  During  [[pregnancy]], the [[uterine gland]]s and [[blood vessel]]s in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the [[placenta]], which supplies [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=histology&gt;[http://www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/CorePages/FemaleRepro/FemaleRepro.htm Blue Histology - Female Reproductive System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221174122/http://www.lab.anhb.uwa.edu.au/mb140/CorePages/FemaleRepro/FemaleRepro.htm |date=2007-02-21 }}.

=== Support ===
[[File:Gray1161.png|thumb|left|220px|Uterus covered by the broad ligament]]
The uterus is primarily supported by the [[pelvic diaphragm]], [[perineal body]] and the [[urogenital diaphragm]]. Secondarily, it is supported by ligaments and the [[peritoneal ligament]] the [[broad ligament of uterus]].&lt;ref name=ucc&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/medsoc/1styr/resources/anatomy/The%20Pelvis.doc The Pelvis] University College Cork Archived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041631/http://www.ucc.ie/medsoc/1styr/resources/anatomy/The%20Pelvis.doc the original] on 2008-02-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Major ligaments ==== &lt;!--Major ligaments of uterus redirects here--&gt;
It is held in place by several peritoneal ligaments, of which the following are the most important (there are two of each):

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! From !! To
|-
| [[Uterosacral ligament]] || Posterior cervix  || Anterior face of [[sacrum]]
|-
| [[Cardinal ligaments]] || Side of the cervix ||  [[Ischial spine]]s
|-
| [[Pubocervical ligament]]&lt;ref name=ucc/&gt; ||Side of the cervix||[[Pubic symphysis]]
|}

=== Axis ===
Normally the uterus lies in anteversion &amp; anteflexion. In most women, the long axis of the uterus is bent forward on the long axis of the vagina, against the urinary bladder. This position is referred to as anteversion of the uterus. Furthermore, the long axis of the body of the uterus is bent forward at the level of the internal os with the long axis of the cervix. This position is termed anteflexion of the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Clinical Anatomy by regions, 8th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Uterus assumes anteverted position in 50% women, retroverted position in 25% women and rest have midposed uterus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Position ===
The uterus is in the middle of the pelvic cavity in [[frontal plane]] (due to [[ligamentum latum uteri]]). The fundus does not surpass the [[linea terminalis]], while the vaginal part of the cervix does not extend below [[interspinal line]]. The uterus is mobile and moves posteriorly under the pressure of a full bladder, or anteriorly under the pressure of a full rectum. If both are full, it moves upwards. Increased intra-abdominal pressure pushes it downwards. The mobility is conferred to it by musculo-fibrous apparatus that consists of suspensory and sustentacular part. Under normal circumstances the suspensory part keeps the uterus in anteflexion and anteversion (in 90% of women) and keeps it "floating" in the pelvis. The meaning of these terms are described below:
{| class="wikitable"
! Distinction !! More common !! Less common
|-
| Position tipped || "Anteverted": Tipped forward  || "[[Retroverted uterus|Retroverted]]": Tipped backwards
|-
| Position of fundus  || "Anteflexed": Fundus is pointing forward relative to the cervix  || "Retroflexed": Fundus is pointing backwards
|}
The sustentacular part supports the pelvic organs and comprises the larger [[pelvic diaphragm]] in the back and the smaller [[urogenital diaphragm]] in the front.

The pathological changes of the position of the uterus are:
* [[Retroverted uterus|retroversion]]/retroflexion, if it is fixed
* hyperanteflexion&amp;nbsp;– tipped too forward; most commonly congenital, but may be caused by tumors
* anteposition, retroposition, lateroposition&amp;nbsp;– the whole uterus is moved; caused by [[parametritis]] or tumors
* elevation, descensus, prolapse
* rotation (the whole uterus rotates around its longitudinal axis), torsion (only the body of the uterus rotates around)
* inversion

In cases where the uterus is "tipped", also known as [[retroverted uterus]], women may have symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse, pelvic pain during menstruation, minor incontinence, urinary tract infections, fertility difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womens-health.co.uk/retrover.asp|title=Retroverted Uterus: What it is &amp; How it Affects Pregnancy|website=www.womens-health.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005022310/http://www.womens-health.co.uk/retrover.asp|archivedate=2013-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and difficulty using tampons.  A pelvic examination by a doctor can determine if a uterus is tipped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/womenshealth/tippeduterus.html Tipped Uterus:Tilted Uterus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224161243/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/womenshealth/tippeduterus.html |date=2011-02-24 }} AmericanPregnancy.org. Accessed 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood supply ===
[[Image:Gray589.png|thumb|left|Vessels of the uterus and its appendages, rear view.]]
[[File:Uterine arterial vasculature.svg|thumb|150px|Schematic diagram of uterine arterial vasculature seen as a cross-section through the [[myometrium]] and [[endometrium]].]]
The uterus is supplied by arterial blood both from the [[uterine artery]] and the [[ovarian artery]]. Another anastomotic branch may also supply the uterus from anastomosis of these two arteries.

=== Nerve supply ===
Afferent nerves supplying the uterus are [[Spinal nerves#Thoracic nerves |T11 and T12]]. Sympathetic supply is from [[Superior hypogastric plexus|hypogastric plexus]] and [[ovarian plexus]]. Parasympathetic supply is from second, third and fourth sacral nerves.

=== Development ===
Bilateral [[Müllerian duct]]s form during early fetal life. In males, [[anti-müllerian hormone]] (AMH) secreted from the testes leads to their regression. In females, these ducts give rise to the [[Fallopian tubes]] and the uterus. In humans the lower segments of the two ducts fuse to form a single uterus, however, in cases of [[uterine malformation]]s this development may be disturbed. The different uterine forms in various mammals are due to various degrees of fusion of the two Müllerian ducts.

Various congenital conditions of the uterus can develop in utero. Though uncommon some of these are a double uterus, didelphic uterus, bicornate uterus and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Surgical%20Correction%20of%20Uterovaginal%20Anomalies/item/48|title=Surgical Correction of Uterovaginal Anomalies {{!}} GLOWM|website=www.glowm.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228112310/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Surgical%20Correction%20of%20Uterovaginal%20Anomalies/item/48|archivedate=2017-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The reproductive function of the uterus is to accept a fertilized [[ovum]] which passes through the [[utero-tubal junction]] from the [[fallopian tube]] (uterine tube). The  fertilized ovum divides to become a [[blastocyst]], which implants into the [[endometrium]], and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, attaches to a wall of the uterus, creates a placenta, and develops into a [[fetus]] (gestates) until [[childbirth]]. Due to anatomical barriers such as the [[pelvis]], the uterus is pushed partially into the abdomen due to its expansion during pregnancy. Even during pregnancy the mass of a human uterus amounts to only about a kilogram (2.2 pounds).

The uterus also plays a role in [[sexual arousal|sexual response]], by directing blood flow to the [[pelvis]] and [[ovaries]], and to the external [[genitals]], including the [[vagina]], [[labia]], and [[clitoris]].

== Clinical significance ==
A [[hysterectomy]] is the surgical removal of the uterus which may be carried out for a number of reasons including the ridding of [[neoplasm|tumours]] both benign and [[cancer|malignant]].  A complete hysterectomy involves the removal of the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus. A partial hysterectomy may just involve the removal of the uterine body while leaving the cervix intact. It is the most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure. 

During [[pregnancy]] the growth rate of the fetus can be assessed by measuring the [[fundal height]].

Some [[pathology|pathological]] states include:
* [[Uterine prolapse|Prolapse of the uterus]]
* [[Carcinoma of the cervix]]&amp;nbsp;– malignant neoplasm
* [[Carcinoma of the uterus]]&amp;nbsp;– malignant neoplasm
* [[Uterine fibroids|Fibroid]]s&amp;nbsp;– benign neoplasms
* [[Adenomyosis]]&amp;nbsp;– ectopic growth of endometrial tissue within the myometrium
* [[Endometritis]], infection at the uterine cavity.
* [[Pyometra]]&amp;nbsp;– infection of the uterus, most commonly seen in dogs
* [[Uterine malformation]]s mainly congenital malformations including [[Uterine Didelphys]], bicornuate uterus and septate uterus. It also includes congenital absence of the uterus [[Rokitansky syndrome]]
* [[Asherman's syndrome]], also known as intrauterine [[adhesions]] occurs when the basal layer of the endometrium is damaged by instrumentation (e.g. [[Dilation and curettage|D&amp;C]]) or infection (e.g. endometrial [[tuberculosis]]) resulting in endometrial scarring followed by adhesion formation which partially or completely obliterates the uterine cavity.
* [[Hematometra]], which is accumulation of blood within the uterus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/noncancerous-gynecologic-abnormalities/cervical-stenosis|title=Cervical Stenosis - Women's Health Issues - Merck Manuals Consumer Version|work=Merck Manuals Consumer Version|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{anchor|Fluid accumulation}}

* Accumulation of fluids other than blood or of unknown constitution. One study came to the conclusion that [[postmenopausal]] women with endometrial fluid collection on [[gynecologic ultrasonography]] should undergo [[endometrial biopsy]] if the endometrial lining is thicker than 3&amp;nbsp;mm or the endometrial fluid is [[echogenic]]. In cases of a lining 3&amp;nbsp;mm or less and clear endometrial fluid, endometrial biopsy was not regarded to be necessary, but [[endocervical curettage]] to rule out endocervical cancer was recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takacs P, De Santis T, Nicholas MC, Verma U, Strassberg R, Duthely L |title=Echogenic endometrial fluid collection in postmenopausal women is a significant risk factor for disease |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=1477–81 |date=November 2005  |pmid=16239648 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Most animals that lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]], such as [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s, including most [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] species, have an [[oviduct]] instead of a uterus. However,  recent research into the biology of the [[Viviparity|viviparous]] (not merely [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]) [[skink]] ''[[Trachylepis]] ivensi'' has revealed development of a very close analogue to [[eutheria]]n mammalian placental development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackburn | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Flemming | first2 = A. F. | year = 2011 | title = Invasive implantation and intimate placental associations in a placentotrophic African lizard, Trachylepis ivensi (scincidae) | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 273| issue = | pages = 137–59| doi = 10.1002/jmor.11011 | pmid=21956253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[monotreme]]s, mammals which lay eggs, namely the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s, either the term ''uterus'' or ''oviduct'' is used to describe the same organ, but the egg does not develop a [[placenta]] within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and [[fertilization]].

[[Marsupials]] have two uteri, each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third, middle "vagina" which functions as the birth canal.&lt;ref name="Nowak1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald M. Nowak|title=Walker's Mammals of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T37sFCl43E8C&amp;q=uterus#v=snippet&amp;q=uterus&amp;f=false|date=7 April 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsupial [[embryo]]s form a [[choriovitelline placenta]] (which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a "true" placenta), in which the egg's yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryo's nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mother's bloodstream. However, [[bandicoots]] also have a rudimentary chorioallantoic placenta, similar to those of placental mammals.

{{anchor|Forms in mammals}}

The [[fetus]] usually develops fully in [[Placentalia|placental mammals]] and only partially in [[marsupial]]s including [[kangaroo]]s and [[opossum]]s. In marsupials the uterus forms as a duplex organ of two uteri. In [[monotreme]]s (egg-laying mammals) such as the [[platypus]], the uterus is duplex and rather than nurturing the embryo, secretes the shell around the egg. It is essentially identical with the [[oviduct|shell gland]] of birds and reptiles, with which the uterus is [[homology (biology)|homologous]].&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|pages= 390–392|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the four main forms of the uterus are: duplex, bipartite, bicornuate and simplex.&lt;ref&gt;Lewitus, Eric, and Christophe Soligo.

Evolutionary Biology 38.3 (2011): 287-305.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Duplex     : There are two wholly separate uteri, with one fallopian tube each. Found in [[marsupial]]s (such as [[kangaroo]]s, [[Tasmanian devil]]s, [[opossum]]s, etc.), [[rodent]]s (such as [[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s), and [[lagomorpha]] ([[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s).
; Bipartite  : The two uteri are separate for most of their length, but share a single cervix. Found in [[ruminant]]s ([[deer]], [[moose]], [[elk]] etc.), [[hyrax]]es, [[cat]]s, and [[horse]]s.
; Bicornuate : The upper parts of the uterus remain separate, but the lower parts are fused into a single structure. Found in [[dog]]s, [[pig]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[tarsier]]s, and [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s among others.
; Simplex    : The entire uterus is fused into a single organ. Found in higher [[primates]] (including [[humans]] and [[chimpanzees]]) . Occasionally, some individual females (including humans) may have a [[bicornuate uterus]], a [[uterine malformation]] where the two parts of the uterus fail to fuse completely during fetal development.

Two uteri usually form initially in a female and usually male fetus, and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species. In many species with two uteri, only one is functional. Humans and other higher [[primate]]s such as [[chimpanzee]]s, usually have a single completely fused uterus, although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused.

The '''vaginal epithelium''' is the [[Gland|aglandular]] inner lining of the [[vagina]] consisting of multiple layers of ([[Epithelium|squamous]]) cells.&lt;ref&gt;Up to 26 layers have been seen - see Pathology, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical; Mayeaux, E.

The intermediate layers lie upon the basal layer and the superficial layer is the outermost layer of the epithelium.&lt;!-- The layers between the basal layer and the most superficial layer are the intermediate layers.  The wall of the vagina from the lumen outwards consists firstly of a [[mucous membrane]] of [[stratified squamous epithelium]] with an underlying [[lamina propria]] of [[connective tissue]]. Secondly, there is a layer of [[smooth muscle]] with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers. Lastly is an outer layer of connective tissue called the [[adventitia]].

=== Basal cells ===
The basal layer of the epithelium is the most mitotically active and reproduces new cells.&lt;ref name="Blaustein2002" /&gt; This layer is composed of one layer of cuboidal cells laying on top of the basal membrane.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Parabasal cells ===
The parabasal cells include the stratum granulousum and the stratum spinosum.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these two layers, cells from the lower basal layer transition from active metabolic activity to death (apoptosis). In these mid-layers of the epithelia, the cells begin to lose their [[mitochondria]] and other cell organelles.&lt;ref name="Blaustein2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reproductive and developmental toxicology|last=Gupta|first=Ramesh| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-12-382032-7|location=London|pages=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple layers of parabasal cells are polyhedral in shape with prominent nuclei.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Intermediate cells ===
Intermediate cells make abundant glycogen and store it.&lt;ref name="Wehrend17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Estrogen]] induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with [[glycogen]].&lt;ref name="Robboy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunn KL, Forney LJ | title = Unraveling the Dynamics of the Human Vaginal Microbiome | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–337 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27698617 | pmc = 5045142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intermediate cells contain nuclei and are larger than the parabasal cells and more flattened. Some have identified a transitional layer of cells above intermediate layer&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Superficial cells ===
[[Estrogen]] induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with [[glycogen]].&lt;ref name="Robboy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Several layers of superficial cells exist that consist large, flattened cells with indistinct nuclei. The superficial cells are exfoliated continuously.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Cell junctions ===
The junctions between epithelial cells regulate the passage of molecules, bacteria and viruses by functioning as a physical barrier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The three types of structural adhesions between epithelial cells are: tight junctions, [[adherens junction]]s, and [[desmosome]]s. "Tight junctions ([[Tight junction|zonula occludens]]) are composed of [[transmembrane protein]]s that make contact across the intercellular space and create a seal to restrict [[transmembrane proteins]] difusion.&lt;ref name="Beckmann" /&gt; of molecules across the epithelial sheet. Tight junctions also have an organizing role in epithelial polarization by limiting the mobility of membrane-bound molecules between the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane of each epithelial cell. Adherens junctions (zonula adherens) connect bundles of [[Microfilament|actin filaments]] from cell to cell to form a continuous adhesion belt, usually just below the microfilaments."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blaskewicz CD, Pudney J, Anderson DJ | title = Structure and function of intercellular junctions in human cervical and vaginal mucosal epithelia | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–104 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21471299 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.110.090423 | url = https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/85/1/97/2530426 | pmc = 3123383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Junction integrity changes as the cells move to the upper layers of the epidermis.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

=== Mucous ===
The vagina itself does not contain [[mucous gland]]s.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunn KL, Wang YY, Harit D, Humphrys MS, Ma B, Cone R, Ravel J, Lai SK | title = Enhanced Trapping of HIV-1 by Human Cervicovaginal Mucus Is Associated with Lactobacillus crispatus-Dominant Microbiota | journal = mBio | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e01084-15 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26443453 | pmc = 4611035 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01084-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Mucus|mucous]] is not produced by the vaginal epithelium, mucous originates from the cervix.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The cervical mucous that is located inside the vagina can be used to assess fertility in ovulating women.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nfp.marquette.edu/nfp_quick_inst_mucus.php|title=NFP Quick Instructions for the Marquette Model (Mucus Only)|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Marquette University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bartholin's glands]] and [[Skene's gland]]s located at the entrance of the vagina do produce mucous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3s_s6-G3hVwC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22vaginal+mucus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HwRyOODJko&amp;sig=VcBNgAYdW88nlyrVH-ldz8tnlkw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzk8313qzZAhVDZKwKHTVvBGA4FBDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vaginal%20mucus%22&amp;f=false|title=Sperm Competition in Humans: Classic and Contemporary Readings|last=Shackelford|first=Todd K.|last2=Pound|first2=Nicholas| name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780387280363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The epithelium of the vagina originates from three different precursors during embryonic and [[Prenatal development|fetal development]]. These are the vaginal squamous epithelium of the lower vagina, the columnar epithelium of the [[Cervical canal|endocervix]], and the squamous epithelium of the upper vagina. The distinct origins of vaginal epithelium may impact the understanding of [[vaginal anomalies]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reich O, Fritsch H | title = The developmental origin of cervical and vaginal epithelium and their clinical consequences: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 358–60 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24977630 | doi = 10.1097/lgt.0000000000000023 | url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00128360-201410000-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vaginal adenosis]] is a vaginal anomaly traced to displacement of normal vaginal tissue by other reproductive tissue within the muscular layer and epithelium of the vaginal wall. This displaced tissue often contains glandular tissue and appears as a raised, red surface.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbJjfMjDM7cC&amp;pg=PA1388&amp;dq=vagina+epithelium&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig-PaBk5DZAhUkpFkKHaMIB4MQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vagina%20epithelium&amp;f=false|title=The 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2011|last=Domino|first=Frank J.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9781608312597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyclic variations ==
During the luteal and follicular phases of the estrous cycle the structure of the vaginal epithelium varies. The number of cell layers vary during the days of the estrous cycle:

Day 10, 22 layers

Days 12-14, 46 layers

Day 19,  32 layers

Day 24, 24 layers

The glycogen levels in the cells is at its highest immediately before ovulation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Lytic cells==
[[File:Vagina (mucosa).JPG|thumb|Different layers of the vaginal epithelium]]

Without estrogen, the vaginal epithelium is only a few layers thick. Only small round cells are seen that originate directly from the basal layer ([[Stratum basale|basal cells]]) or the cell layers (parabasal cells) above it. The parabasal cells, which are slightly larger than the basal cells, form a five- to ten-layer cell layer.  The parabasal cells can also differentiate into [[histiocyte]]s or glandular cells. Estrogen also influences the changing ratios of nuclear constituents to cytoplasm. As a result of cell aging, cells with shrunken, seemingly foamy cell nuclei (intermediary cells ) develop from the parabasal cells. These can be categorized by means of the nuclear-plasma relation into "upper" and "deep" intermediate cells.&lt;ref name="Knörr" /&gt; Intermediate cells make abundant glycogen and store it. The further nuclear shrinkage and formation of [[mucopolysaccharides]] are distinct characteristics of superficial cells. The mucopolysaccharides form a [[keratin]]-like cell scaffold. Fully keratinized cells without a nucleus are called 'floes'.&lt;ref name="Nauth23"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Hans Friedrich | last1 = Nauth | name-list-format = vanc | title = Gynäkologische Zytodiagnostik|edition = 2nd |publisher = Georg Thieme|location = Stuttgart|year=2014| page = 23 |isbn=978-3-13-131092-7|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wehrend17"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Axel | last1 = Wehrend | name-list-format = vanc | title=Leitsymptome Gynäkologie und Geburtshilfe beim Hund|publisher=Enke|location = Stuttgart|year = 2010| page = 17|isbn=978-3-8304-1076-8 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate and superficial cells are constantly exfoliated from the epithelium. The glycogen from these cells is converted to sugars and then fermented by the bacteria of the vaginal flora to lactic acid.&lt;ref name="Nauth23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The cells progress through the cell cycle and then decompose (cytolysis) within a week's time. Cytolysis occurs only in the presence of glycogen-containing cells, that is, when the epithelium is degraded to the upper intermediate cells and superficial cells. In this way, the cytoplasm is dissolved, while the cell nuclei remain.&lt;ref name="Nauth23" /&gt;

== Epithelial microbiota==
[[File:Glycogen structure.svg |thumb|Glycogen is the complex form of sugar present in the vaginal epithelium that is metabolized into lactic acid]]

Low pH is necessary to control vaginal microbiota. Vaginal epithelial cells have a relatively high concentration of glycogen compared to other epithelial cells of the human body. The metabolism of this complex sugar by the lactobacillus dominated microbiome is responsible for vaginal acidity.&lt;ref name=" Aroutcheva "&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aroutcheva A. |author2=Gariti D. |author3=Simon M. |author4=Shott S. |author5=Faro J. |author6=Simoes J.

== Function ==
The [[Cell junction|cellular junctions]] of the vaginal epithelium help prevent pathogenic microorganisms from entering the body though some are still able to penetrate this barrier. Cells of the cervix and vaginal epithelium generate a [[Mucus|mucous]] barrier (glycocalyx) in which immune cells reside. In addition, [[white blood cell]]s provide additional immunity and are able to infiltrate and move through the vaginal epithelium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The epithelium is permeable to antibodies, other immune system cells, and [[macromolecule]]s. The permeability of epithelium thus provides access for these immune system components to prevent the passage of invading pathogens into deeper vaginal tissue.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The epithelium further provides a barrier to microbes the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides ([[Beta defensin|beta-defensins]] and [[cathelicidin]]s) and immunoglobulins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Terminally differentiated, superficial keratinocytes extrude the contents of [[lamellar bodies]] out of the cell to form a specialized, intercellular [[lipid]] envelope that encases the cells of the epidermis and provides a physical barrier to microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Clinical significance==
[[File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|Vaginal epithelial cells containing chlamydia bacteria]]

=== Disease transmission ===
Sexually transmitted infections, including HIV are rarely transmitted across intact and healthy epithelium. These protective mechanisms are due to: frequent exfoliation of the superficial cells, low pH, and innate and acquired immunity in the tissue. Research into the protective nature of the vaginal epithelium has been recommended as it would help in the design of [[topical medication]] and microbicides.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

=== Atrophy ===
The vaginal epithelium changes significantly when estrogen levels decrease at menopause.&lt;ref&gt;''Vulvovaginal atrophy'' and ''atrophic vaginitis'' have been the preferred terms for this condition and cluster of symptoms until recently. These terms are now regarded as inaccurate in describing changes to the whole genitourinary system occurring after menopause. The term ''atrophic vaginitis'' suggests that the vaginal is inflamed or infected. Though this may be true, inflammation and infection are not the major components of postmenopausal changes to the vagina after menopause. The former terms do not describe the negative effects on the lower urinary tract which can be the most troubling symptoms of menopause for women.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atrophic vaginitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim HK, Kang SY, Chung YJ, Kim JH, Kim MR | title = The Recent Review of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause | language = English | journal = Journal of Menopausal Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–71 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26357643 | doi = 10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65 | url = https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually causes scant odorless discharge with no odor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faubion SS, Sood R, Kapoor E | title = Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: Management Strategies for the Clinician | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 1842–1849 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29202940 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.08.019 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025619617306390 | via =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24031">'''Work–life interface''' is the intersection of [[Employment|work]] and private life. There are many aspects of one's personal life that can intersect with work including family, leisure, and health. Work–life interface is bidirectional; for instance, work can interfere with private life, and private life can interfere with work. This interface can be adverse in nature (e.g., work-life conflict) or can be beneficial (e.g., work-life enrichment) in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Allen, T. D. (2011). Work–family balance: A review and extension of the literature. In J. C. Quick &amp; L. E. Tetrick (Eds.),'' Handbook of occupational health psychology (2nd ed.).'' (pp. 165–183). Washington, DC US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominant theories of the relationship==
Several theories explain different aspects of the relationship between the work and family life. Boundary theory and border theory are the two fundamental theories that researchers have used to study these role conflicts. Other theories are built on the foundations of these two theories.

Seven dominant theories have been utilized to explain this relationship on the boundary-border spectrum; These theories are: structural functioning, segmentation, compensation, supplemental and reactive compensation, role enhancement, spillover, and work enrichment model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lavassani, K. M., &amp; Movahedi, P. (2014). DEVELOPMENTS IN THEORIES AND MEASURES OF WORK-FAMILY. ''Contemporary Research on Organization Management and Administration, 2'', 6–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural functionalism===
The roots of this theory can be traced back to the early 20th century, when industrial revolution was separating economic work from the family home. The 19th century’s technological advancements in machinery and manufacturing initiated the separation of work from family. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the first view of work-family theories started to shape. Structural-functionalism as one of the dominant sociology theories of early 20th century was a natural candidate.
The structural functionalism theory, which emerged following WWII, was largely influenced from the industrial revolution and the changes in the social role of men and women during this period.  This theory implies that the life is concerned mainly with two separate spheres: productive life which happens in the workplace and affective life which is at home. Structural functionalism theory believes in the existence of radical separation between work (institution, workplace, or market) and families. According to this theory, these two (workplace and family) work best "when men and women specialize their activities in separate spheres, women at home doing expressive work and men in the workplace performing instrumental tasks” (Kingsbury &amp; Scanzoni, 1993; as cited in MacDermid, 2005: 18).

===Greedy institutions===
It has been argued that the work-family conflicts, in particular role conflicts, can be interpreted in terms of [[Lewis A. Coser]]'s concept of "greedy institutions". These institutions are called "greedy" in the sense that they make all-encompassing demands on the commitment and loyalty of individuals, and tend to discourage involvement in other social spheres.&lt;ref name="coser1974-nach-currie2000-S270"&gt;Lewis A.

Cohen'', Lexington Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-0-7391-9417-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions such as religious orders, sects, academia, top level sports, the military and senior management have been interpreted as greedy institutions. On the other hand, also the family has been interpreted as a greedy institution in consideration of the demands placed on a caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Edwards: ''Mature Women Students: Separating Or Connecting Family and Education'', Taylor &amp; Francis 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-7484-0087-4}}, Chapter 4 ''{{'}}Greedy Institutions': Straddling the worlds of family and education''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMseC99ORHIC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Currie, Patricia Harris, Bev Thiele: ''Sacrifices in Greedy Universities: are they gendered?'' Gender and Education, 2000, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 269–291.&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is involved in two greedy institutions  – be it child care and university, or family and the military,&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Segal: ''The Military And the Family As Greedy Institutions'', Armed Forces &amp; Society (1986), Vol. 13 No. 1, p. 9–38, {{DOI|10.1177/0095327X8601300101}} (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; or others − task and role conflicts arise.

===Segmentation===
Based  on  this theory  work  and  family do  not  affect  each other, since  they  are  segmented  and  independent  from  each  other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The literature also reports the usage of the terms compartmentalization, independence, separateness, disengagement, neutrality, and detachment to describe this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz Jennifer|first1=Higbee Jeanne|title=An Exploration Of Theoretical Foundations For Working Mothers’ Formal Workplace Social Networks|journal=Journal of Business &amp; Economics Research|date=April 2010 |volume=8|issue=4|pages=87–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
In 1979, Piotrkowski argued that according to this theory employees “look to their homes as havens, [and] look to their families as sources of satisfaction lacking in the occupational sphere."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; What distinguishes compensation theory from the previous theories is that, in compensation theory, for the first time, the positive effect of work to family has been recognized.

===Supplemental and reactive compensation===
Supplemental and reactive compensation theories are two dichotomies of compensation theory which were developed during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. While compensation theory describes the behavior of employees in pursuing an alternative reward in the other sphere, supplemental and reactive compensation theories try to describe the reason behind the work-family compensation behavior of employees.

===Role enhancement theory===
According to this theory, the combination of certain roles has a positive, rather than a negative effect on well-being. This theory states that participation in one role is made better or easier by virtue of participation in the other role. Moreover, this theory acknowledges the negative effect of the work-family relationship, in which, only beyond a certain upper limit may overload and distress occur, however, the central focus of this perspective is mainly on the positive effects of work and family relationship, such as resource enhancement.

===Spillover===
Spillover is a process by which an employee’s experience in one domain affects their experience in another domain. Theoretically, spillover is perceived to be one of two types: positive or negative. Spillover as the most popular view of relationship between work and family, considers multidimensional aspects of work and family relationship.

===Work enrichment model===
This theory is one of the recent models for explaining the relationship between work and family. According to this model, experience in one role (work or family) will enhance the quality of life in the other role. In other words, this model tries to explain the positive effects of the work-family relationship.

==Work–family conflict==
{{Main article|Work–family conflict}}
Work and family studies historically focus on studying the conflict between different roles that individuals have in their society, specifically their roles at work, and their roles as a family member.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Work–family conflict is defined as [[role|interrole]] conflict where the participation in one role interfere with the participation in another. Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) differentiate three sources for conflict between work and family: 
# "time devoted to the requirements of one role makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76);
# "strain from participation in one role makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76);
# "specific behaviors required by one role make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of another" (p.&amp;nbsp;76).
Conceptually, the conflict between work and family is bi-directional. Scholars distinguish between what is termed work-to-family conflict (WFC), and what is termed family-to-work conflict (FWC). This bi-directional view is displayed in the figure on the right.
[[File:Work-Family Spillover.png|thumb|alt=Bi-directional relationship of Work-to-Family and Family-to-Work.|Adopted from Lavassani &amp; Movahedi (2014)''[[Work-life interface]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;]]

Accordingly, WFC might occur when experiences at work interfere with family life like extensive, irregular, or inflexible [[Working time|work hours]]. Family-to-work conflict occurs when experiences in the family interfere with work life. For example, a parent may take time off from work in order to take care of a sick [[child]]. Although these two forms of conflict — WFC and FWC — are strongly [[correlation|correlated]] with each other, more attention has been directed at WFC. This may because family demands are more elastic than the boundaries and responsibilities of the work role. Also, [[research]] has found that work roles are more likely to interfere with family roles than family roles are likely to interfere with work roles.

Allen, Herst, Bruck, and Sutton (2000)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; describe in their paper three categories of consequences related to WFC: work-related outcomes (e.g., [[job satisfaction]] or job performance), nonwork-related outcomes (e.g., life or family satisfaction), and stress-related outcomes (e.g., [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[substance abuse]]). For example, WFC has been shown to be negatively related to job satisfaction whereas the association is more pronounced for females.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A., Cordeiro, B. L., &amp; Crouter, A. C. (2005). A longitudinal and multi-source test of the work-family conflict and job satisfaction relationship. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 78'', 305–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of studies investigating the consequences of WFC were interrogating [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] from Western countries, such as U.S. Therefore, the generalizability of their findings is in question. Fortunately, there is also literature studying WFC and its consequences in other cultural contexts, such as [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;Lu, L., Kao, S. F., Cooper, C. L., Allen, T. D., Lapierre, L. M., O`Driscoll, M., Poelmans, S. A. Y., Sanchez, J. I., &amp; Spector, P. L. (2009). Work resources, work-to-family conflict, and its consequences: A Taiwanese–British cross-cultural comparison. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 16'', 25-44.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Pal, S., &amp; Saksvik, P. Ø. (2008). Work–family conflict and psychosocial work environment stressors as predictors of job stress in a cross-cultural study. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 15'', 22–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Lu, Kao, Cooper, Allen, Lapierre, O`Driscoll, Poelmans, Sanchez, and Spector (2009) could  not find any cultural difference related in work-related and nonwork-related outcomes of WFC when they compared [[Great Britain]] and Taiwan. Likewise, Pal and Saksvik (2008) also did not detect specific cultural differences between employees from [[Norway]] and India. Nevertheless, more cross-cultural research is needed to understand the cultural dimensions of the WFC construct.

The research concerning [[Intervention (counseling)|interventions]] to reduce WFC is currently still very limited. As an exception, Nielson, Carlson, and Lankau (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, T. R., Carlson, D. S., &amp; Lankau, M. J. (2001). The supportive mentor as a means of reducing Work–Family conflict. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 59'', 364–381.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that having a [[peer support|supportive]] [[mentor]] on the job correlates negatively with the employee’s WFC. However, other functions of mentoring, like the role model aspect, appear to have no effect on WFC. Therefore, the mechanisms how having a mentor influences the work–family interface remain unclear.

In terms of [[primary intervention|primary]] and [[secondary intervention]] there are some results. Hammer, Kossek, Anger, Bodner, and Zimmerman (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L. B., Kossek, E., Anger, W., Bodner, T., &amp; Zimmerman, K. L. (2011). Clarifying work–family intervention processes: The roles of work–family conflict and family-supportive supervisor behaviors. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 96'', 134–150.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a field study and showed that training [[supervisor]]s to show more family supportive behavior, led to increased physical [[health]] in employees that were high in WFC. At the same time, employees having low WFC scores even decreased in physical health. This shows that even though interventions can help, it is important to focus on the right persons. Otherwise, the intervention damages more than it helps.
Another study (Wilson, Polzer-Debruyne, Chen, &amp; Fernandes, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, M. G., Polzer-Debruyne, A., Chen, S. &amp; Fernandes, S. (2007). Shift work interventions for reduced work–family conflict. ''Employee Relations, 29'', 162–177.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that training employees helps to reduce [[shift work]] related WFC. Additionally, this training is more effective, if the partner of the focal person is also participating. Therefore, integrating the family into the intervention seems to be helpful too.
There are various additional factors that might influence the effectiveness of WFC interventions. For example, some interventions seem more adequate to reduce family-to-work conflict (FWC) than WFC (Hammer et al., 2011). More research is still needed, before optimal treatments against WFC can be derived.

==Work–family enrichment==
{{Main article|Work–family enrichment}}

Work–family enrichment or work–family facilitation is a form of positive spillover, defined as a process whereby involvement in one domain establishes benefits and/or [[resource]]s which then may improve performance or involvement in another domain (Greenhaus &amp; Powell, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Greenhaus, J. H., &amp; Powell, G. N. (2006). When work and family are allies: A theory of work–family enrichment. ''Academy of Management Review, 31'', 72–92.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, involvement in the family role is made easier by participation in the work role (Wayne, Musisca, &amp; Fleeson, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, J. H., Musisca, N., &amp; Fleeson, W. (2004). Considering the role of personality in the work–family experience: Relationships of the big five to work–family conflict and facilitation. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 64'', 108–130. {{doi|10.1016/S0001-8791(03)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to work–family conflict which is associated with several negative consequences, work–family enrichment is related to positive organizational outcomes such as job satisfaction and effort (Wayne et al., 2004). There are several potential sources enrichment can arise from. Examples are that resources (e.g., positive [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]) gained in one role lead to better functioning in the other role (Sieber, 1974)&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, S. D. (1974). Toward a theory of role accumulation. ''American Sociological Review, 39'', 567–578. {{doi|10.2307/2094422}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[skill]]s and [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] that are acquired in one role are useful in the other role (Crouter, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Crouter, A. C. (1984). Spillover from family to work: The neglected side of the work–family interface. ''Human Relations, 37'', 425–441. {{doi|10.1177/001872678403700601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, enrichment between work and family is bi-directional. Most researchers make the distinction between what is termed work–family enrichment, and what is termed family–work enrichment. Work–family enrichment occurs, when ones involvement in work provides skills, behaviors, or positive mood which influences the family life in a positive way. Family-work enrichment, however, occurs when ones involvement in the family domain results in positive [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], feeling of success or support that help individuals to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] better with problems at work, feel more confident and in the end being more productive at work (Wayne, et al., 2004).

Several [[:wikt:antecedent|antecedent]]s of work–family enrichment have been proposed. [[Trait theory|Personality traits]], such as [[extraversion]] and [[openness to experience|openness for experience]] have been shown to be positively related to work–family enrichment (Wayne et al., 2004). Next to individual antecedents, organizational circumstances such as resources and skills gained at work foster the occurrence of work–family enrichment (Voydanoff, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Voydanoff, P. (2004). The effects of work demands and resources on work-to-family conflict and facilitation. ''Journal of Marriage and Family, 66'', 398–412. {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-3737.2004.00028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abilities such as interpersonal communication skills are learned at work and may then facilitate constructive communication with family members at home.

==The emergence of new family models==
"Our review suggests that most of what is known about Work-Family issues is based on the experiences of heterosexual, Caucasian, managerial and professional employees in family arrangements" (Casper et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

==The role of organization and supervisor==
Research has focused especially on the role of the organization and the supervisor in the reduction of WFC. Results provide evidence for the negative association between the availability of family friendly resources provided by the work place and WFC. General support by the organization aids the employees to deal with work family issues so that organizational support is negatively connected to WFC (Kossek, Pichler, Bodner, &amp; Hammer, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Kossek, E.E., Pichler, S., Bodner, T., &amp; Hammer, L. (2011). Workplace Social Support and Work-Family Conflict: A Meta Analysis Clarifying the Influence of General and Work Specific Supervisor and Organizational Support. ''Personnel Psychology, 64'', 289–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kossek et al. (2011) showed that work family specific support has a stronger negative connection with work family conflict. Interesting results by other researchers show that family friendly organizational culture also has an indirect effect on WFC via supervisor support and coworker support (Dolcoy &amp; Daley, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Dolcos, S., &amp; Daley, D. (2009). Work pressure, workplace social resources and work-family conflict: The tale of two sectors, ''International Journal of Stress Management, 16'', 291–311.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, some research also shows that the utilization of provided resources such as child care support or flexible work hours has no longitudinal connection with WFC (Hammer, Neal, Newson, Brockwood, &amp; Colton, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L., Neal, M., Newson, J., Brockwood, K., &amp; Colton, C. (2005). A Longitudinal Study of the Effects of Dual-Earner Couples’ Utilization of Family-Friendly Workplace Supports on Work and Family Outcomes. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 90'', 799–810.&lt;/ref&gt; This result speaks against common assumptions. Also, the supervisor has a social-support function for his/her subordinates. As Moen and Yu (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Moen, P., &amp; Yu, Y. (2000). Effective work/life strategies: Working couples, work conditions, gender, and life quality. ''Social Problems, 47'', 291–326.&lt;/ref&gt; showed supervisor support is an indicator for lower levels of WFC. Further support for this hypothesis stems from a study conducted by Thompson and Prottas (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, C. A., &amp; Prottas, D. F. (2005). Relationships among organizational family support, job autonomy, perceived control, and employee well-being. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 10'', 100–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in mind the support function, organizations should provide trainings for the supervisors and conduct the selection process of new employees. Similar as for organizational support, the meta-analysis by Kossek et al. (2011) showed that general supervisor is negatively connected to WFC. Again, work–family-specific supervisor support has a stronger negative connection with WFC. Aside from support by the organization and the supervisor, research points out a third source of work-place support: The coworker. The informal support by the coworker not only correlates with positive aspects such as job satisfaction, but is also negatively associated with negative variables such as WFC (Dolcos &amp; Doley, 2009; Thompson &amp; Prottas, 2005).

In terms of work–family enrichment, supervisors and organizations are also relevant, since they are able to provide with important resource (e.g., skills and financial benefits) and positive affect.

==Research methods to investigate==
A methodological review by Casper, Eby, Bordeaux, Lockwood, and Lambert (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Casper, W. J., Eby, L. T., Bordeaux, C., Lockwood, A., &amp; Lambert, D. (2007). A review of research methods in IO/OB work-family research. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 92'', 28–43.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the research methods used in the area of work-family research from 1980 to 2003. Their main findings are:

· The descriptions of sample characteristics are often inconsistent and leave out essential information necessary to evaluate if generalization is appropriate or not.
&lt;br /&gt;· Samples are mostly homogenous, neglecting diversity regarding racial, ethnic, cultural aspects, and non-traditional families (e.g., [[Single person|single]] or [[homosexuality|homosexual]] parents).
&lt;br /&gt;· The research design of most studies is [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] and correlational. Field settings are predominant (97%). Only 2% use [[experiment]]al designs.
&lt;br /&gt;· [[Statistical survey|Surveys]] are mostly used for data collection (85%) whereas [[Qualitative research|qualitative methods]] are used less often. Measures are mainly derived from one single person (76%) and focus on the individual level of analysis (89%). In this respect, research on, for example, dyads and [[social group|groups]] have been neglected.
&lt;br /&gt;· Simple inferential statistics are preferred (79%) instead of, for example, [[structural equation modeling]] (17%).
&lt;br /&gt;· Regarding reliability aspects, coefficient [[Cronbach alpha|alpha]] is often provided (87%), thereby reaching .79 on average. Pre-existing [[Rating scale|scales]] are often used (69%) containing multi-item measures (79%).

In light of these results, Casper, et al. (2007) give several recommendations. They suggest, for example, that researchers should use more [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] and experimental research designs, more diverse samples, data sources and levels of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">The '''World Mental Health Survey Initiative''' is a collaborative project by [[World Health Organization]], [[Harvard University]], [[University of Michigan]], and country-based researchers worldwide to coordinate the analysis and implementation of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]] of [[Mental_disorder|mental]] and [[Behavioral disorder|behavioral]] disorders and substance abuse in all [[World_Health_Organization#Regional_offices|WHO Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/|website=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/international/world-mental-health-survey-initiative/|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.
