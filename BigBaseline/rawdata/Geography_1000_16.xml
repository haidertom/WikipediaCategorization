The '''Anton Melik Geographical Institute''' ({{lang-sl|Geografski inštitut Antona Melika}}) was founded in 1946 by the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. In 1976 it was named after the [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[geographer]] and academy member [[Anton Melik]] (1890–1966), who was the first head of the institute. Since 1981, the institute has been a member of the Scientific Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Until 1992 the institute was mainly engaged with researching [[glacier]]s, glacial and fluvial transformations of land surfaces, [[flood]]ed areas, natural disasters, mountain farms, and social geography. Since 1993 the institute's main task has been to conduct geographical studies of [[Slovenia]] and its landscapes and to prepare basic geographical texts on [[Slovenia]] as a country and as part of the [[world]]. 

Research is mostly directed toward physical, social, and regional geography and thematic [[cartography]]. 

==Facilities==
It has nine organizational units: 

* Department of [[Physical Geography]] 
* Department of [[Social geography|Social Geography]] 
* Department of [[Regional geography|Regional Geography]] 
* Department of [[Natural Disaster]]s 
* Department of [[environmentalism|Environmental Protection]] 
* Department of the Geographical Information System
* Department of [[thematic map|Thematic Cartography]] 
* Geographical Museum
* Geographical Library 

The institute houses a map collection and three specialized geographical collections: Landscapes of Slovenia, Settlements of Slovenia, and Glaciers of Slovenia. It is headquarters of the Commission for the Standardization of Geographical Names of the [[Government of Slovenia|Government of the Republic of Slovenia]] (''Komisija za standardizacijo zemljepisnih imen Vlade Republike Slovenije''). 

==Publications==
The institute publishes three scholarly publications. ''[[Geografija Slovenije]]'' (Geography of Slovenia) is a series of books that appears in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] once or twice a year. ''[[Acta geographica Slovenica]]/[[Geografski zbornik]]'' is a journal published twice a year in [[English language|English]] and Slovene. The articles can be downloaded in Slovene or English from the [http://ags.zrc-sazu.si journal homepage]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Geografski informacijski sistemi v Sloveniji'' (Geographical Information Systems in Slovenia) is a bulletin published every second (even) year in Slovene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12639">[[File:Beating the Bounds Oriel Oxford.jpg|thumb|Beating the bounds of the parish of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in Oxford.]]'''Beating the bounds''' is an ancient custom still observed in some [[England|English]] and [[Wales|Welsh]] [[parish]]es. Under the name of the '''Gangdays''' the custom of going a-ganging was kept before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:368.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of old and young members of the community would walk the boundaries of the parish, usually led by the parish priest and church officials, to share the knowledge of where they lay, and to pray for protection and blessings for the lands.

==Ceremony==
[[File:Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane - geograph.org.uk - 440810.jpg|thumb|Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane, Cambridge. The clergy and people of [[Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge|Little St Mary's Church]] annually walk round the boundaries of the parish, singing hymns and psalms and praying for blessings on the residents and their activities.]]
In former times when [[map]]s were rare&lt;ref&gt;The Ordnance Survey of the entire UK only began in the early 19th century and it was many years before the survey was complete.&lt;/ref&gt; it was usual to make a formal perambulation of the parish boundaries on [[Ascension Day]] or during [[Rogation days|Rogation week]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Knowledge of the limits of each parish needed to be handed down so that such matters as liability to contribute to the repair of the church, and the right to be buried within the churchyard were not disputed. The relevant jurisdiction was that of the [[ecclesiastical courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Tate, W. E.(1946) ''The Parish Chest''. Cambridge: Univ. Press; pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; The [[priest]] of the parish with the [[churchwarden]]s and the parochial officials headed a crowd of boys who, armed with green boughs, usually birch or willow, beat the parish [[boundary marker]]s with them. Sometimes the boys were themselves whipped or even violently bumped on the boundary-stones to make them remember. The object of taking boys along is supposed to ensure that witnesses to the boundaries should survive as long as possible.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Priests would pray for its protection in the forthcoming year and often Psalms 103 and 104 were recited, and the priest would say such sentences as "Cursed is he who transgresseth the bounds or doles of his neighbour".&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"&gt;Tate (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; Hymns would be sung, indeed a number of hymns are titled for their role, and many places in the English countryside bear names such as [[Gospel Oak]] testifying to their role in the beating of the bounds.

The ceremony had an important practical purpose. Checking the boundaries was a way of preventing encroachment by neighbours; sometimes boundary markers would be moved, or lines obscured, and a folk memory of the true extent of the parish was necessary to maintain integrity of borders by embedding knowledge in oral traditions. For a village man dwelling in champion country{{clarifyme|date=April 2016}}, under the traditional [[open field system]], George Homans remarks, "the bounds of his village were the most important bounds he knew."&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1991:368.&lt;/ref&gt; Village and parish were coterminous. The modern system of [[metes and bounds]] operates fundamentally similarly, giving a prose definition of a property as if walking about it.

At [[Manchester (ancient parish)|Manchester]] in 1597 [[John Dee]] recorded in his diary that he with the curate, the clerk and "diverse of the town of diverse ages" perambulated the bounds of the parish taking six days in all.&lt;ref&gt;Frangopulo, N. J. (1962) ''Rich Inheritance''. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Turnworth]] in Dorset the parish register records the perambulation for 1747 thus:&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"/&gt;
{{quote|1747. On Ascension Day after morning prayer at Turnworth Church, was made a public Perambulation of the bounds of the parish of Turnworth by me Richd. Cobbe, Vicar, Wm. Northover, Churchwarden, Henry Sillers and Richard Mullen, Overseers and others with 4 boys; beginning at the Church Hatch and cutting a great T on the most principal parts of the bounds. Whipping the boys by way of remembrance, and stopping their cry with some half-pence; we returned to church again, which Perambulation and Processioning had not been made for five years last past.}}

In a few cases such as the Corporation of the City of Portsmouth the bounds were on the shoreline and the route was followed by boat rather than on foot.&lt;ref name=gates66&gt;{{cite book |title=The Portsmouth that has Passed: With a Glimpse of Gosport |last=Gates |first=William G |editor1-first=Nigel |editor1-last=Peak  |year=1987 |publisher=Milestone Publications |isbn=1-85265-111-3 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice is still lawful and not affected by the limiting of the jurisdiction in 1860.{{clarification needed|date=May 2015|reason=How was what jurisdiction limited in 1860?}} Parish officers have the right to enter private property in carrying it out and also use the rates to cover expenses properly incurred (including refreshments, but not music, etc.). Perambulations must be at least three years apart.&lt;ref name="Tate 1946"/&gt;

==Origins==
In England, the custom dates from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] times, as it is mentioned in laws of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Athelstan of England|Æthelstan]]. It is thought that it may have been derived from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[Terminalia]]'', a festival celebrated on February 22 in honour of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god of [[landmark]]s, to whom cakes and wine were offered while sports and dancing took place at the boundaries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Similar practices, of [[pagan]] origin, were brought by the [[Norsemen]].&lt;ref name="Cholesbury"&gt;[http://www.cholesbury.com/beatbounds.htm ''Beating the Cholesbury Bounds'']. Retrieved August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In England, a [[parish ale]], a feast, was always held after the perambulation, which assured its popularity. In [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign the occasion had become an excuse for so much [[:wikt:revelry|revelry]] that it attracted the condemnation of a preacher who declared, "These solemne and accustomable processions and supplications be nowe growen into a right foule and detestable abuse."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Beating the bounds had a [[religion|religious]] aspect which is reflected in the [[rogation]], where the accompanying [[clergy]] beseech (''rogare'') the [[divinity|divine]] [[blessing]] upon the parish lands for the ensuing [[harvest]]. This feature originated in the 5th century, when [[Mamertus]], [[Archbishop of Vienne]], instituted special [[prayer]]s, [[fasting]] and  [[Religious procession|processions]] on these days. This clerical side of the parish bounds-beating was one of the religious functions prohibited by the Royal Injunctions of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1559; but it was then ordered that the perambulation should continue to be performed as a quasi-[[secular]] function, so that evidence of the boundaries of parishes, etc., might be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, ''Codex juris Ecclesiastici Anglicani'' (1761) pp. 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bequest]]s were sometimes made in connection with bounds-beating. For example, at [[Leighton Buzzard]] on Rogation Monday, in accordance with the will of Edward Wilkes, a [[London]] merchant who died in 1646, the [[trustee]]s of his [[almshouse]]s accompanied the boys. The will was read and [[beer]] and plum rolls distributed. A remarkable feature of the bequest was that while the will is read one of the boys has to [[headstand|stand on his head]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Contemporary observations==

=== England ===
[[File:Millennium stone - geograph.org.uk - 607400.jpg|thumb|This stone commemorates a beating of the [[Marldon]] parish bounds in Devon in May 2000.]]
Although modern surveying techniques make the ceremony obsolete, at least for its secular purpose, many English parishes carry out a regular beating of the bounds, as a way of strengthening the community and giving it a sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html A Sense of Place - Common Ground website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415134830/http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html |date=2008-04-15 }}. Retrieved 06 04 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865–66 [[William Robert Hicks]] was mayor of [[Bodmin]] in Cornwall, when he revived the custom of beating the bounds of the town. This still takes place more or less every five years and concludes with a game of [[Cornish hurling]]. Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin and was last played in 2015.&lt;ref name=bodmin&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodmin Beating the Bounds &amp; Hurling|url=http://calendarcustoms.com/articles/bodmin-beating-the-bounds-hurling/|publisher=Calendar Customs|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is started by the mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the "Salting Pool". There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the "Salting Pool" via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a £10 reward from the Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005032340/http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 |date=2011-10-05 }}, ''Rotary Club of Bodmin'', 02/04/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The next occurrence of the Bodmin Hurl will follow the next beating of the bounds, in 2020.&lt;ref name=bodmin/&gt;

=== Massachusetts and New Hampshire ===

Perambulation of the town borders is a traditional duty of town boards of [[selectmen]] in the American states of [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="rsa"&gt;[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/51/51-2.htm ''TITLE III TOWNS, CITIES, VILLAGE DISTRICTS, AND UNINCORPORATED PLACES CHAPTER 51 TOWN LINES AND PERAMBULATION OF BOUNDARIES Section 51:2''] . Retrieved March 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Hampshire and Vermont ===

The laws of [[Vermont]] and New Hampshire require the attorneys general of those states to meet once every seven years to perambulate the boundary between the two states. They do not walk 275 miles along the Connecticut River, but they meet at the boundary and formally reaffirm their mutual understanding of the precise location of the boundary. The location had been disputed in the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Vermont v. New Hampshire]]'', decided in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/015/00611 Vermont Statutes, Title 1: Chapter 15: New Hampshire–Vermont Boundary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorneys General Delaney and Sorrell Will Meet on the Norwich/Hanover Bridge on May 14th for the Eleventh Perambulation of the NH/VT Boundary|url=https://www.doj.nh.gov/media-center/press-releases/2012/20120510-perambulation-boundary.htm|publisher=New Hampshire Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General|date=May 10, 2012|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Benchmark in Edinburgh.jpg|right|thumb|180px|An [[Ordnance Survey]] cut mark in the UK]]
[[File:Benchmark on rock near Llyn Crafnant.jpg|thumb|Occasionally a non-vertical face was used, and a slightly different mark was used]]

The term '''benchmark''', or '''bench mark''', originates from the chiseled horizontal marks that [[Surveying|surveyor]]s made in stone structures, into which an angle-iron could be placed to form a "bench" for a [[Level staff|leveling rod]], thus ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately repositioned in the same place in the future. These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled [[Broad arrow|arrow]] below the horizontal line.

The term is generally applied to any item used to mark a point as an elevation reference.  Frequently, bronze or aluminum disks are set in stone or concrete, or on rods driven deeply into the earth to provide a stable elevation point. If an elevation is marked on a map, but there is no physical mark on the ground, it is a [[spot height]].

The [[Height#In geodesy|height]] of a benchmark is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending from a ''fundamental benchmark''.  A fundamental benchmark is a point with a precisely known relationship to the level datum of the area, typically [[mean sea level]]. The position and height of each benchmark is shown on large-scale maps.

The terms "height" and "elevation" are often used interchangeably, but in many jurisdictions they have specific meanings; "height" commonly refers to a local or relative difference in the vertical (such as the height of a building), whereas "elevation" refers to the difference from a nominated reference surface (such as sea-level, or a mathematical/geodetic model that approximates the sea level known as the [[geoid]]).  Elevation may be specified as [[normal height]] (above a reference ellipsoid), [[orthometric height]], or [[dynamic height]] which have slightly different definitions.

== Other types of survey marks ==
[[Image:Flush bracket G4863.jpg|right|thumb|180px|An [[Ordnance Survey]] flush bracket]]

[[Triangulation]] points, also known as [[trig point]]s, are marks with a precisely established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as the tip of a [[church (building)|church]] [[spire]] or a [[chimney stack]] are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the [[United Kingdom]] triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as "fixed in three dimensions".

==Agencies responsible for benchmarks==
Benchmarks are typically placed ("monumented") by a government agency or private survey firm, and many governments maintain a register of these marks so that the records are available to all. These records are usually in the form of a geographically searchable database (computer or map-based), with links to sketches, diagrams, photos of the marks, and any other technical details.

Government agencies that place and maintain records of benchmarks include:
* [[Canada]]
** [[Natural Resources Canada]] (Geodetic Survey Division)
* [[France]]
** [[Institut Géographique National]] ([[:fr:Institut géographique national|IGN on Wiki FR]]).
*[[India]]
**[[Survey of India]]

'''Bouldergaine''' is a variant sport combining the disciplines of [[bouldering]] and [[rogaining]].

The sport takes place in a large boulder field, which is mapped in a similar way to a traditional rogaine. Teams of 2 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score. At each checkpoint is at least one extra bonus point station, which requires scrambling or climbing to access. A successful team will require a mixture of fitness, climbing ability and map skills.

The world's first bouldergaine was held on March 15, 2014 at [[Castle Hill, New Zealand|Kura Tawhiti / Castle Hill]] in Canterbury, New Zealand. The event was organised by the [[New Zealand Alpine Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contour Lines|url=http://papo.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-December.pdf|publisher=papo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 100 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBS Website|url=http://nbs.org.nz/news/2014/worlds-first-bouldergaine-a-success|publisher=nbs.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuff.co.nz|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9830768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">The '''Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing''' ('''CSTARS''') is a [[ground station]] that receives [[imagery]] data from a variety of [[remote sensing]] [[satellites]].  CSTARS is owned and operated by the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], a college within the [[University of Miami]].

[[File:CSTARS_logo.jpg|256px|right|thumb]]

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf "Research Notes" eVeritas]&lt;/ref&gt; This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].&lt;ref name=dhs/&gt;

CSTARS is located on the Richmond campus of the [[University of Miami]] at {{Coord|25.6137|-80.384|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility CSTARS Site Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708041603/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ==
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ==
The United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] has included CSTARS as one of its "Centers of Excellence" so that CSTARS will work with the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] to research [[port]] security and maritime [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] issues.&lt;ref name=dhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|title=University of Miami’s CSTARS To Form Part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Center of Excellence for Maritime Security|work=Press Release|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf CSTARS: PROTECTING OUR PORTS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003309/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf |date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Office of Naval Research (ONR) ==
The [[Office of Naval Research]] awarded CSTARS a grant to support satellite based research studies on internal [[Swell (ocean)|waves]] and [[typhoons]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,2593-1;65847-3,00.html A Wave of Support for Satellite Research]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211031615/http://www6.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1%2C1770%2C2593-1%3B65847-3%2C00.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTARS participated in a [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] study to examine how to protect one of the largest Marine Protected (MPA) areas in the world through the utilization of commercially available earth imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/05/palau_monitoring_control_and_surveillance.pdf ''The Republic of Palau Exclusive Economic Zone MONITORING, CONTROL, AND SURVEILLANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term '''collective landscape''' was introduced to [[landscape design]] and [[landscape planning]] by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]]. He wrote, on the dust jacket of his book:
::''The landscape of man'', that '' "The world is moving into a phase when landscape design may well be recognized as the most comprehensive of the arts. Man creates around him an environment that is a projection into nature of his abstract ideas. It is only in the present century that the '''collective landscape''' has emerged as a social necessity. We are promoting a landscape art on a scale never conceived of in history." ''

==Definitions==
It appears that the term was inspired by [[Carl Jung]]'s use of the term [[collective unconscious]]. Jellicoe admired Jung, but the use of 'collective landscape' in the above quotation has something in common with its use in [[collectivism]]. Unlike the terms [[public park]] and [[national park]], the term collective landscape is a psychological construct and an abstract concept.

'Collective landscape' is therefore best understood as a landscape which:
* exists in the collective unconscious
* like other [[public good]]s, does not belong to any individual

==Contemporary applications==
In American contemporary [[landscape architecture]] the term 'collective landscape' is used to mean 'landscape which matters to the community' as in the following quotation from the ''Smokey Mountain News'' for the week of 10/12/05: '' "The struggle to preserve a '''collective landscape''' heritage has been fought and won by the Cherokee once in the past, but is now at risk again." ''

A '''county surveyor''' is a public official in many [[County (United States)|counties of the United States]]. At the bottom of this page are working "External Links" as at 4 November 2011 to websites of a selection of such County Surveyor's departments. Most of these officials are elected on the partisan ballot to four-year terms. They administer the county [[Surveying|land survey]] records, re-establish and maintain the [[Survey marker|official government survey monuments]], and review property boundaries surveys and subdivision plans. Other duties vary from state to state. Those marked with an asterisk (*) are nominated by the National Association of County Surveyors (NACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscounties.org/nacs/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919043213/http://www.uscounties.org/nacs/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-19 |title=Welcome to the NACS Web Site |publisher=Uscounties.org |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter V 'The Development of an Extra-Legal Constitution', of 'English Local Government from the Revolution to the Municipal Corporations Act: The Parish and The County' by Sidney Webb and Beatrice Potter Web, describes the increasing chaos that began to prevail within this same period on the 'county surveying' front in England and Wales. Eventually, the military defence component of county surveying in the UK began to separate from the civil in 1791, with the Crown's 'Board of Ordnance' being commissioned to carry out a comprehensive survey of the South Coast of England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/about-us/our-history/index.html |title=About Ordnance Survey, Britain's national mapping agency |publisher=Ordnancesurvey.co.uk |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005070314/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/about-us/our-history/index.html |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a result of 'the last invasion of Britain 1797', at [[Battle of Fishguard|Fishguard]] in South West Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishguardonline.com/last_inv.html |title=Last Invasion |publisher=Fishguardonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately extended to all of the UK. With that shift in emphasis, county surveying began to concentrate more on its civil engineering and civic architecture roles, producing the historically famous British county surveyors such as [[Thomas Telford]], [[John Loudon McAdam]] and [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]];&lt;ref&gt;'The Life and Work of John Nash Architect' Summerson, John: 1980: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd: England; 'John Nash - A Complete Catalogue': Mansbridge, Michael: 1991: Phaidon Press: London and New York; and 'John Nash Architect-Pensaer': Suggett, Richard: 1995: The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, Aberystwyth; and, The National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth&lt;/ref&gt; the expression, "County Surveyor", became a UK statutory title ([[Bridges Act 1530|Bridges Act 1803]]); and, in England and Wales, its incumbents were appointed by elected councils as of the coming into effect of the [[Local Government Act 1888]] rather than being Crown-appointed by Justices of the Peace.

The UK equivalent of NACS, namely, the County Surveyors Society (CSS) founded in 1885, was subsumed into the pluralistic Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adeptnet.org.uk/ adeptnet.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119151458/http://www.adeptnet.org.uk/ |date=November 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4933">{{about|the measure of curvature||degree (angle)}}

'''Degree of curve''' or '''degree of curvature''' is a measure of [[curvature]] of a circular arc used in [[civil engineering]] for its easy use in layout [[surveying]].

==Definition==
The degree of curvature is defined as the central angle to the ends of an arc or chord of agreed length.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf and Ghilani. Elementary Surveying, 11th ed., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Various lengths are commonly used in different areas of practice. This angle is also the change in forward direction as that portion of the curve is traveled.

==Usage==
Curvature is usually measured in [[radius of curvature]]. A small circle can be easily laid out by just using radius of curvature, But if the radius is large as a km or a mile, degree of curvature is more convenient for calculating and laying out the curve of large scale works like roads and railroads. By this method curve setting can be easily done with the help of a transit or theodolite and a chain, tape or rope of a prescribed length.

In an ''n''-degree curve, the forward bearing changes by ''n'' [[degree (angle)|degrees]] over the standard length of arc or chord.  The usual distance in North American road work is {{convert|100|ft|2}} of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Foote, and Kelly. Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;  North American railroad work traditionally used 100 feet of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] and this may be used in other places for road work.  Other lengths may be used—such as 30 metres or 100 metres where [[SI]] is favoured, or a shorter length for sharper curves. Where degree of curvature is based on 100 units of arc length, the conversion between degree of curvature and radius is {{math|1=''Dr'' = 18000/&amp;pi; &amp;asymp; 5729.57795}}, where {{math|1=''D''}} is degree and {{math|1=''r''}} is radius. 

As an example, a curve with an arc length of 600 units that has an overall sweep of 6 degrees is a 1-degree curve: For every 100 feet of arc, the bearing changes by 1 degree. The radius of such a curve is 5729.57795.  If the chord definition is used each 100-unit chord length will sweep 1 degree with a radius of 5729.651 units, and the chord of the whole curve will be slightly shorter than 600 units.

Since rail routes have very large radii, they are laid out in chords, as the difference to the arc is inconsequential and this made work easier before electronic calculators became available.  

The {{convert|100|ft|2}} is called a station, used to define length along a road or other alignment, annotated as stations plus feet 1+00, 2+00 etc.  Metric work may use similar notation, such as kilometers plus meters 1+000.

==Formulas for radius of curvature==
Degree of curvature can be converted to radius of curvature by the following formulae:

[[File:Degree of Curvature Formula Explanation.svg|Degree of Curvature Formula Explanation|thumb|Diagram showing different parts of the curve used in the formula]]

{{wiktionary|doldrums}}
The '''doldrums''' is a [[colloquial]] expression derived from historical [[maritime history|maritime]] usage, which refers to those parts of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] affected by a low-pressure area around the [[equator]] where the [[prevailing winds]] are calm.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping [[sailing ship]]s for periods of days or weeks.  The term appears to have arisen in the eighteenth century, when trans-equator sailing voyages became more common.  Since this zone is where two [[trade winds]] meet, it is also called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].  They roughly lie between latitudes five degree north and south.

==Maritime usage==
In maritime usage, the low pressure characteristics of the doldrums are caused by the expanding atmosphere due to heating at the equator, which makes the air rise and travel north and south high in the atmosphere, until it subsides again in the [[horse latitudes]].  Some of that air returns to the doldrums through the [[trade winds]].  This process can lead to light or variable winds and more severe weather, in the form of [[squall]]s, thunderstorms, and hurricanes.  The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping sail-powered boats for periods of days or weeks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Colloquial usage==
Colloquially, the "doldrums" are a state of inactivity, mild depression, listlessness, or stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doldrums |title=Doldrums|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may be derived from ''dold,'' an archaic term meaning "stupid", and ''-rum(s)'', a noun suffix found in such words as "[[tantrum]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/doldrums|work=Random House Dictionary|publisher= Random House, Inc.|date= 2011|title=Doldrums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and writing==
The doldrums are notably described in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1798), in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'' (1978), and in [[Laura Hillenbrand]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]'' (2010). Additionally, the Doldrums are a fictional place in [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961).

[[Noel Gallagher]] used the term to describe a woman stuck in the decade of the [[1960s]] in the song [[Holy Mountain (song)|Holy Mountain]] “get out of the doldrums, baby now!”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16674">'''Earth section paths''' are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a [[reference ellipsoid]] and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated [[geodesy|geodetic problems]].

== The Indirect Problem ==
The indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, of the short arc of a spheroid section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) [[azimuth]]s of that curve, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; have geodetic latitude  &lt;math&gt;\phi_k&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using [[analytic geometry]] in [[ECEF]] coordinates.
Let &lt;math&gt;R_1=ECEF(P_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2=ECEF(P_2)&lt;/math&gt; be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

=== Section plane ===
To define the section plane select any third point &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; not on the line from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to be on the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; will define the normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, &lt;math&gt;lx + my + nz = d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, requires the components of a [[unit vector]], &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_0=R_1 - R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_1=R_2 - R_1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;unit(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The orientation convention used here is that &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; = -&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the [[dot product]] of &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. d = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}\cdot{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; ⋅ &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = d, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of (x, y, z).

=== Azimuth ===
A unit vector pointing up at any point on the ellipsoid is: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(\cos\phi\cos\lambda,\cos\phi\sin\lambda,\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, a unit vector pointing north is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\phi\cos\lambda,-\sin\phi\sin\lambda,\cos\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and east is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\lambda,\cos\lambda,0)&lt;/math&gt;. A vector tangent to the path is:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}= \hat{N} \times \mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; so the east component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the north component is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a [[atan2|two-argument arctangent function]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}},\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}})&lt;/math&gt;. Use this method at both &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Section Ellipse ===
The (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, on the section path from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[elliptic integral]] that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.
Let the ellipsoid given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{l^2+m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
If p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

If p&gt;0 then Gilbertson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbertson|first1=Charles|title=Earth Section Paths|journal=Navigation|date=Spring 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1-7|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/navi.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is &lt;math&gt;{R_c}=\frac{d}{C}(la^2, ma^2, nb^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C=a^2p^2+b^2n^2&lt;/math&gt;,

the semi-major axis is &lt;math&gt;a^*=a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}=(\frac{m}{p}, \frac{-l}{p}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, and
the semi-minor axis is &lt;math&gt;b^*=\frac{b}{\sqrt{C}}a^*&lt;/math&gt;,  in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}=(\frac{ln}{p}, \frac{mn}{p}, -p)&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arc Length ===
The polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)= \frac{b^*}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e^2=1-\frac{(b^*)^2}{(a^*)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, relates to the ellipse eccentricity,  not the spheroid eccentricity (see [[ellipse]]). Let P be a point on the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;R=ECEF(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then the vector from &lt;math&gt;{R_c}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;R-R_c&lt;/math&gt;. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}=unit(R-R_c)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta =\operatorname{atan2}(\sin\theta,\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we obtain the central angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt; \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1  + \pi &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[arc length]] along the ellipse is given by &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; =&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{R^2+(R^')^2}d\theta.&lt;/math&gt; Substituting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in 
&lt;math&gt;s_{12} = ArcLength(\theta_1,\theta_2) = b^*({c_0}\Delta\theta + {c_1}\Delta s2 + {c_2}\Delta s4 + {c_3}\Delta s6)&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta\theta&amp;=\theta_2-\theta_1,\\[6pt]
\Delta s2&amp;=\sin(2\theta_2)-\sin(2\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s4&amp;=\sin(4\theta_2)-\sin(4\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s6&amp;=\sin(6\theta_2)-\sin(6\theta_1),\\[6pt]
{c_0}&amp;=1+e^2(4096 + 3328e^2 + 2880e^4 + 2577e^6 + 16860e^8)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_1}&amp;=e^2(512 + 384e^2 + 380e^4 + 385e^6 + 3408e^8)/4096,\\[6pt]
{c_2}&amp;=-e^4(64 + 80e^2 + 19e^4 - 3516e^6)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_3}&amp;=-e^6(60 + 105e^2 - 528e^4)/12288.\\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, expansions for the [[Meridian arc]] may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.

== The Direct Problem ==
The direct problem is given &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and departure azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; and the arrival azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Section plane ===
Construct the tangent vector at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}= \mathbf\hat{n_1}\cos{\alpha_1} + \mathbf{\hat{e_1}}\sin{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Pick a vector,  &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; must not be in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1} ,\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt;} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, so no path would result). The normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}&lt;/math&gt;),  together with &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; defines the plane.
=== Locate &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;===
This is a 2-d problem in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{i^*} , \mathbf\hat{j^*}&lt;/math&gt;},  which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as 
&lt;math&gt;V={V_c} + {r(\theta)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
To get an initial estimate of &lt;math&gt;{\theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;{V_1}={R_1}-R{_c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\theta_1}&lt;/math&gt;=Central_Angle&lt;math&gt;({V_1})&lt;/math&gt; (see the arc length section above),
&lt;math&gt;{r_1}=r({\theta_1})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta=\frac{\delta}{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now initialize &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 + \Delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and iterate the following steps:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= ArcLength({\theta_1}, {\theta_2}),\\[6pt]
Err &amp;= \delta - s,\\[6pt]
s'({\theta}) &amp;= \frac{b^*}{(1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta)}\sqrt{\frac{(1-(2-e^2) e^2 \cos^2 \theta}{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}},\\[6pt]
\Delta\theta &amp;= \frac{Err}{s'({\theta_2})}, \\[6pt]
\theta_2 &amp;= \theta_2 + \Delta\theta, \\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
exit when &lt;math&gt;abs(\Delta\theta) &lt; 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt;

No more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.
Finally, let &lt;math&gt;{V_2}={V_c} + {r(\theta_2)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta_2+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; = ECEF_to_Geo&lt;math&gt;({V_2})&lt;/math&gt; using Bowring’s 1985 algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The accuracy of geodetic latitude and height equations|journal=Survey Review|date=1985|volume=28|issue=218|pages=202-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the algorithm [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

Alternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.

=== Azimuth ===
Azimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: &lt;math&gt;{\alpha_2}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e_2}},\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n_2}})&lt;/math&gt;, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
=== The great ellipse ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be the origin, so that &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; = the position vector of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The Direct and Inverse Solutions for the Great Elliptic Line on the Reference Ellipsoid|journal=Bulletin Geodesique|date=1984|volume=58|issue=1|pages=101-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal sections ===
The normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; (the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The normal section -- forward and inverse formulae at any distance|journal=Survey Review|date=1971|volume=XXI|issue=161|pages=131-136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The mean normal section ===
The mean normal section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;0.5(\mathbf\hat{u_1}+\mathbf\hat{u_2})&lt;/math&gt;. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; for aviation or sailing.

=== A class of sections ===
A class of sections may be imagined by rotating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; about the chord connecting &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2.&lt;/math&gt; All of these may be solved with the single approach above.

== Intersections ==
Let two section planes be given: &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = \hat{N_1} \times \hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; are not colinear &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exist constants &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where t is an independent parameter.

Since this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;{C_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{C_2}&lt;/math&gt; gives 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;), and 
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;).

Define the “dihedral angle”, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_1}}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_1- d_2  \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; ,  and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_2- d_1 \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2 \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the intersection line we have &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;l_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;m_3&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;C_1l_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2l_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1m_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2m_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1n_1&lt;/math&gt; +&lt;math&gt;C_2n_2&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_i}&lt;/math&gt;=(&lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;), for i=1,2,3.

To find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, to get
&lt;math&gt;At^2 + 2Bt + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;l_3^2 + m_3^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}n_3^2&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0l_3 + y_0m_3 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0n_3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 + y_0^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0^2 - a^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the line intersects the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{{B}^2-AC}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 &lt; AC&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no intersection. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;, then the line is tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = -B/A&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).

Observe that &lt;math&gt;A\ne0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;are not colinear.  Plugging t into
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.

=== Examples ===
==== Maximum or Minimum Latitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = (m, -l, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;d_2 = z_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging t into &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0 + t\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm b^*\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Maximum or Minimum Longitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (-\sin\theta, \cos\theta, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the longitude to be solved for such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm a^*\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19705">'''The exploration of [[North America]]''' by non-indigenous people was a continuing effort to map and explore the continent of North America. It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The [[European colonization of the Americas]] followed.

==Pre-Columbian exploration==
{{main|Norse colonization of the Americas}}{{See also|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
According to the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], [[Norsemen|Norse]] sailors (often called [[Vikings]]) from [[Iceland]] first settled [[Greenland]] in the 980s. [[Erik the Red]] explored and settled southwestern [[Greenland]], which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern]] and [[Western Settlement]]s, which were abandoned around 1350.

[[L'Anse aux Meadows]], an [[archaeological site]] on the northernmost tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of [[Vinland]] established by [[Leif Erikson]] in 1003.

==Age of Discovery and the search for the Northwest Passage==
{{clear}}{{euromericas}}{{further|European colonization of the Americas}}
The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the [[Old World]], and Europeans remained unaware of the existence of the [[Americas]] as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] to East Asia (or "the Indies" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the [[Silk Road]], a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Also, the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]] needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.

[[File:The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492.jpg|thumb|The arrival of Christopher Colombus to America, 1492]]
On August 3, 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the [[Province of Huelva]], from the newly ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Católicos]]'' coordinated Kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], in present-day [[Spain]], financed by Queen [[Isabella I of Castille]].  [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage]] of his discovery of the [[Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], and [[Hispaniola]] spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in his second voyage then discovered both [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern [[South America]]n coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the [[Central American]] coast. The [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] opened the [[New World]].

Italian navigator and explorer [[Giovanni Caboto]] (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]]. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|Juan de la Cosa's map]] of 1500.

In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they reached [[Greenland]] and sighted [[Labrador]] for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming "''Terra Verde''" the explored North American coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diffie|first=Bailey|title=Prelude to empire: Portugal overseas before Henry the Navigator|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1960|isbn=0-8032-5049-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjBfEorbZWAC&amp;lpg|ref=Diffie 1960|pages=464–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations were signaled in 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a [[New World]], which in 1507 was named "America", probably after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], on the [[Waldseemüller map]].

==Further nautical explorations==
In 1500, [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was sent by [[Portugal]] to explore [[South America]]. He is considered to be the discoverer of [[Brazil]].

[[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] sent [[Juan Ponce de León]] from the fledgling colony on [[Hispaniola]] to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de León disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Ponce de León Inlet]], and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. He encountered the powerful [[Gulf Stream]] and found a passage through the [[Florida Keys]] to land on the southwestern [[Gulf Coast]] of Florida on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Again, the exact location is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day [[United States]] mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Episode 06 Early Maps of Florida" by Robert Cassanello and Kendra Hazen|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/6/|website = stars.library.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1513, Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] was the first European to see the [[Pacific Ocean]] once he crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of [[The Californias|Las Californias]].

Around 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer [[João Álvares Fagundes]] explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and [[Nova Scotia]], with a mission to create colonies.

In 1524, Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed for King [[Francis I of France]] and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the [[Cape Fear River]] delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]], entering the [[Pamlico Sound]], and bypassing entrances to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Believing the [[New York Harbor]] to be a lake, he sailed past [[Long Island]], exploring [[Narragansett Bay]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].

In 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer [[Estevão Gomes]], on behalf of [[Charles I of Spain]], explored present-day [[Nova Scotia]] sailing South along the [[Maine]] coast. Gomes entered [[New York Harbor]] and saw the [[Hudson River]](which he named the "San Antonio River"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]], on the Gulf [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the [[St. Lawrence river]] and also claimed the region for France.

[[File:Henry Hudson map.JPG|thumb|left|Map of Hudson's voyages to North America.]]
After two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating [[Siberia]], [[Henry Hudson]] sailed west in 1609 under the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He, too, passed [[Cape Cod]], Chesapeake Bay and the [[Delaware Bay]], instead sailing up the [[Hudson River]] on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the [[Great Lakes]]. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the [[Hudson Strait]], [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]].

Other major sea-based explorers were Captain [[James Cook]], [[George Vancouver]], and [[Charles Wilkes]].

==Overland exploration of the West==
{{mergefrom|16th century in North American history|date=September 2018}}
===16th to 17th centuries===
There were numerous Spanish explorers and [[conquistadors]] who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] and [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]], but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].

[[File:1814ThompsonMap.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the North-West Territory of the Province of Canada, stretching from the [[Fraser River]] on the west to [[Lake Superior]] on the east. By David Thompson, 1814.]]

In 1608 [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded what is now [[Quebec City]], which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of [[New France]]. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered [[Lake Champlain]] in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the [[Ottawa River]] through [[Lake Nipissing]] and [[Georgian Bay]] to the centre of [[Wyandot people|Huron]] country near [[Lake Simcoe]]. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.

From 1679 to 1682 [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] explored the [[Great Lakes]] region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and the entire course of [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

From 1697 to 1702 [[Eusebio Kino]] explored the [[Sonoran Desert]] and on his journey to the [[Colorado River Delta]] discovered an overland route to [[Baja California]] that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of [[Baja California]].

European exploration of [[western Canada]] was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive [[Northwest Passage]]. [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorer [[Henry Kelsey]] has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern [[Great Plains]] in 1690.

===18th century===

[[Anthony Henday]] was the first to have seen the [[Rocky Mountains]], in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of [[Olds, Alberta]], halfway between [[Calgary]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta]]) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. [[Samuel Hearne]] found the [[Coppermine River]] in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit  exploration.

The [[North West Company]], on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the [[Bella Coola River]], in 1793. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] reached the Pacific in 1808 via the [[Fraser River]].

[[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000&amp;nbsp;km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from [[Lake Superior]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the [[Jay Treaty]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of {{convert|6750|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Grand Portage]], through [[Lake Winnipeg]], to the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers, as well as two sides of [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref name="vanherk"&gt;Aritha Van Herk, ''Travels with Charlotte'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, the company sent him to [[Red Deer Lake (Alberta)|Red Deer Lake]] (in present-day [[Alberta]]) to establish a trading post. The English translation of [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac La Biche]]-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.&lt;ref name=AlbertaAtlas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|publisher=University of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta|title=Lac La Biche 2004-5|series=Atlas of Alberta Lakes|year=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102003742/http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&amp;basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&amp;lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&amp;number=1|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in [[Alberta]]), and during this time led several expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]]. In 1811/1812 he followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of [[western Canada]], covering 3.9 million square kilometres.

===19th century to present===
[[Lewis and Clark]] were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], at the order of President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. [[John Colter]] was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.

[[John C. Frémont]] led many important explorations in the [[Great Plains]], [[Great Basin]], [[History of Oregon|Oregon territory]], and Mexican [[Alta California]].

[[Joseph Reddeford Walker]] was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the [[Humboldt River]] across present-day [[Nevada]], ascending the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] following the [[Carson River]] and descending via [[Stanislaus River]] drainages to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. His return route across the southern Sierra was via [[Walker Pass]], named after Walker by [[John Charles Fremont]]. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the [[California Trail]], the primary route for the emigrants to the [[gold]] fields during the [[California gold rush]].

As the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the [[US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was [[George Wheeler (explorer)|George Wheeler]]. In 1872, the [[US Congress]] authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]] at a scale of 8&amp;nbsp;miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the [[Wheeler Survey]], along with the [[Clarence King]] and [[John Wesley Powell]] Surveys, and expeditions by [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]]. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the [[United States Geological Survey]].

'''Garden design''' is the art and process of [[design]]ing and creating plans for layout and planting of [[garden]]s and [[landscape]]s. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional [[garden designer]]s have some training in [[horticulture]] and the principles of design. Garden designer, [[Rev David Coles]], further elaborated this definition at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] (2018, BBC1, Chelsea) by stating that good garden design, while being on the one hand a “serious discipline” should embody a “playful creative mindfulness”. He postulates that successful garden designs enable transcendence from a physical sensory experience to a mindful awareness of being interconnected with nature. 
Some are also [[landscape architect|landscape architects]], a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Amateur gardeners may also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study, serious study in [[Master gardener program|Master Gardener Programs]], or by joining [[Garden club|gardening clubs]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Elements==
Whether gardens are designed by a professional or an amateur, certain principles form the basis of effective garden design, resulting in the creation of gardens to meet the needs, goals, and desires of the users or owners of the gardens.

Elements of garden design include the layout of [[hardscape|hard landscape]], such as paths, walls, [[Water garden|water features]], sitting areas and decking; as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their [[horticultural]] requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, [[Habit (biology)|growth habit]], size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choice of plants in terms of speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether [[Annual plant|annual]] or [[Perennial plant|perennial]], and bloom-time, and many other characteristics.

Important considerations in the garden design include how the garden will be used, the desired stylistic genre (formal or informal, modern or traditional etc.), and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the prescribed budget.

===Location===
A garden's location can have a substantial influence on its design. Topographical landscape features such as steep slopes, vistas, hills, and outcrops may suggest or determine aspects of design such as layout and can be used and augmented in order to create a particular impression.&lt;ref name="6 Most Beautiful Garden Designs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dronezon.com/best-drone-videos/six-most-beautiful-gardens-by-drone-calms-the-heart-and-mind/|title=6 Most Beautiful Gardens Designed To Calm The Mind|accessdate=September 20, 2015|work=Dronezon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soils of the site will affect what types of plant may be grown, as will the garden's [[climate zone]] and various [[microclimate]]s. The locational context of the garden can also influence its design. For example, an urban setting may require a different design style In contrast to a rural one. Similarly, a windy coastal location may necessitate a different treatment compared to a sheltered inland site.

===Soil===
The quality of a garden's [[soil]] can have a significant influence on a garden's design and its subsequent success. Soil influences the availability of water and nutrients, the activity of soil micro-organisms, and temperature within the root zone, and thus may have a determining effect on the types of plants which will grow successfully in the garden. However, soils may be replaced or improved in order to make them more suitable.

Traditionally, garden soil is improved by amendment, the process of adding beneficial materials to the native subsoil and particularly the [[topsoil]]. The added materials, which may consist of compost, [[peat]], sand, mineral dust, or manure, among others, are mixed with the soil to the preferred depth. The amount and type of amendment may depend on many factors, including the amount of existing soil humus, the soil structure (clay, silt, sand, loam etc.), the soil acidity/alkalinity, and the choice of plants to be grown. One source states that, "conditioning the soil thoroughly before planting enables the plants to establish themselves quickly and so play their part in the design."&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York: A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.213. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all gardens are, or should be, amended in this manner, since many plants prefer an impoverished soil. In this case, poor soil is better than a rich soil that has been artificially enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1998). ''Natural Landscapes.'' New York : Dorling Kindersly Limited, pp.54. {{ISBN|0-7894-1995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablehorticulture.com/myth-soil_amendments.pdf|title=Welcome sustainablehorticulture.com - BlueHost.com|website=www.sustainablehorticulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===
The design of a garden can be affected by the nature of its boundaries, both external and internal, and in turn the design can influence the boundaries, including via creation of new ones. Planting can be used to modify an existing boundary line by softening or widening it. Introducing internal boundaries can help divide or break up a garden into smaller areas.

The main types of boundary within a garden are hedges, walls and fences. A hedge may be evergreen or deciduous, formal or informal, short or tall, depending on the style of the garden and purpose of the boundary. A wall has a strong foundation beneath it at all points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Garden DIY Expert|publisher=pbi publications|year=1992|ISBN=0 903505 37 1|author=Dr D. G. Hessayon|authorlink = D. G. Hessayon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually - but not always - built from brick, stone or concrete blocks. A fence differs from a wall in that it is anchored only at intervals, and is usually constructed using wood or metal (such as iron or wire mesh).

Boundaries may be constructed for several reasons: to keep out livestock or intruders, to provide privacy, to create shelter from strong winds and provide microclimates, to screen unattractive structures or views, and to create an element of surprise.

===Surfaces===
[[Image:Planting-design.jpg|thumb|right|Naturalistic planting design]]
In temperate western gardens, a smooth expanse of lawn is often considered essential to a garden. However garden designers may use other surfaces, for example those "made up of loose gravel, small pebbles, or wood chips" in order to create a different appearance and feel.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes, John (1991). ''The Book of Garden Design.'' New York : A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.226. {{ISBN|0-02-516695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers may also utilise the contrast in texture and color between different surfaces in order to create an overall pattern in the design.

Surfaces for paths and access points are chosen for practical as well as aesthetic reasons. Issues such as safety, maintenance and durability may need to be considered by the designer. Gardens designed for public access need to cope with heavier foot traffic and hence may utilise surfaces – such as resin-bonded gravel – that are rarely used in private gardens.

===Planting design===
Planting design requires [[design]] talent and aesthetic judgement combined with a good level of horticultural, ecological and cultural knowledge. It includes two major traditions: formal rectilinear planting design (Persia and Europe); and formal asymmetrical (Asia) and [[naturalistic planting design]].

====History====
[[Persian gardens]] are credited with originating aesthetic and diverse planting design. A correct Persian garden will be divided into four sectors with water being very important for both irrigation and aesthetics. The four sectors symbolize the Zoroastrian elements of sky, earth, water and plants.&lt;ref name="The Persian Garden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372/|title=The Persian Garden|accessdate=January 25, 2011|work=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting in ancient and Medieval European gardens was often a mix of herbs for medicinal use, vegetables for consumption, and flowers for decoration. Purely aesthetic planting layouts developed after the Medieval period in [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|Renaissance gardens]], as are shown in late-renaissance paintings and plans. The designs of the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] were geometrical and plants were used to form spaces and patterns. The [[gardens of the French Renaissance]] and Baroque [[Garden à la française]] era continued the '[[formal garden]]' planting aesthetic.

In Asia the asymmetrical traditions of planting design in [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese gardens]] originated in the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] of China. The gardens' plantings have a controlled but naturalistic aesthetic. In Europe the arrangement of plants in informal groups developed as part of the [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style, and subsequently the [[French landscape garden]], and was strongly influenced by the [[picturesque]] art movement.

====Application====
[[File:Garden chairs and table, Birkenhead - DSC09774.JPG|thumb|Garden chairs and table]]
A planting plan gives specific instructions, often for a [[general contractor|contractor]] about how the soil is to be prepared, what species are to be planted, what size and spacing is to be used and what maintenance operations are to be carried out under the contract. Owners of private gardens may also use planting plans, not for contractual purposes, as an aid to thinking about a design and as a record of what has been planted. A [[planting strategy]] is a long term strategy for the design, establishment and management of different types of vegetation in a landscape or garden.

Planting can be established by directly employed gardeners and horticulturalists or it can be established by a landscape contractor (also known as a landscape gardener). Landscape contractors work to drawings and specifications prepared by garden designers or landscape architects.

===Garden furniture===
{{Main|Garden furniture}}

Garden furniture may range from a ''patio set'' consisting of a [[Table (furniture)|table]], four or six [[chair]]s and a [[Umbrella|parasol]], through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Garden Furniture'', Charles Thonger, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, {{ISBN|0-554-70114-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patio heater]]s, that run on bottled [[butane]] or [[propane]], are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A [[picnic table]], is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden.

The materials used to manufacture modern patio furniture include [[Rock (geology)|stones]], [[metal]]s, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]]s, [[resins]], [[glass]], and [[Wood preservation|treated]] [[wood]]s.

===Sunlight===
{{See also|Shade garden}}
While sunlight is not always easily controlled by the gardener, it is an important element of garden design. The amount of available light is a critical factor in determining what plants may be grown. Sunlight will, therefore, have a substantial influence on the character of the garden. For example, a rose garden is generally not successful in full shade, while a garden of hostas may not thrive in hot sun. As another example, a vegetable garden may need to be placed in a sunny location, and if that location is not ideal for the overall garden design goals, the designer may need to change other aspects of the garden.

In some cases, the amount of available sunlight can be influenced by the gardener. The location of trees, other shade plants, garden structures, or, when designing an entire property, even buildings, might be selected or changed based on their influence in increasing or reducing the amount of sunlight provided to various areas of the property.

In other cases, the amount of sunlight is not under the gardener's control. Nearby buildings, plants on other properties, or simply the climate of the local area, may limit the available sunlight. Or, substantial changes in the light conditions of the garden may not be within the gardener's means. In this case, it is important to plan a garden that is compatible with the existing light conditions.

===Lighting===
Garden lighting can be an important aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, it is more important to determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.

Photosynthesis provides the energy required to produce the energy source of plants.

Phototropism is the effect of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light.&lt;ref&gt;American Horticultural Society (1980). ''Houseplants.'' Ortho Books and the Franklin Library,&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodism is a plant’s response or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.&lt;ref&gt;"Phoroperiodism." ''The Merriam-Webster Dicrionary Online.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of gardens==
[[File:PalacioDelGeneralife.JPG|thumb|200px|Moorish Generalife courtyard fountain]]

===Islamic gardens===
{{Main|Islamic garden}}

Garden design, and the [[Islamic garden|Islamic garden tradition]], began with creating the [[Paradise garden]] in [[Ancient Persia]], in [[Western Asia]]. It evolved over the centuries, and in the different cultures Islamic dynasties came to rule in Central— [[South Asia]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

[[File:Gogerddan map 115 Gogerddan Gardens 1765.jpg|thumb|A plan of a formal garden for a country estate in Wales, 1765]]

A [[Formal Garden|formal garden]] in the [[Persian garden]] and European [[history of gardening|garden design traditions]] is rectilinear and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of [[Chinese garden]]s and [[Japanese garden]]s. The [[Zen garden]] of rocks, moss and raked gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. [[Tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[subshrub]]s and other [[leaf|foliage]] are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. A French garden or [[Garden à la française]], is a specific kind of formal garden, laid out in the manner of [[André Le Nôtre]]; it is centered on the façade of a building, with radiating [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and paths of gravel, lawns, [[parterre]]s and pools (''bassins'') of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with [[fountain]]s and sculpture.

The [[Garden à la française]] style has origins in fifteenth-century [[Italian Renaissance garden]]s, such as the [[Villa d'Este]], [[Boboli Gardens]], and [[Villa Lante]] in Italy. The style was brought to France and expressed in the [[gardens of the French Renaissance]]. Some of the earliest formal [[parterre]]s of clipped evergreens were those laid out at [[Anet]] by [[Claude Mollet]], the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted deep into the 18th century. The [[Gardens of Versailles]] are an ultimate example of Garden à la française, composed of many different distinct gardens, and designed by [[André Le Nôtre]].

[[English Renaissance]] gardens in a rectilinear formal design were a feature of the [[stately homes]]. The introduction of the parterre was at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s. In the early eighteenth century, the publication of [[Dezallier d'Argenville]], '' La théorie et la pratique du jardinage'' (1709) was translated into English and German, and was the central document for the later formal gardens of Continental Europe.

Traditional formal [[Spanish garden]] design evolved with [[Persian garden]] and [[:Category:Renaissance gardens|European Renaissance garden]] influences. The internationally renowned [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]], built in the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus]] era, have influenced design for centuries. The [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] was located in the celebrated [[Maria Luisa Park]] (''Parque de Maria Luisa'') designed by [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevilla5.com/monuments/plespana.html Sevilla-Parque de Maria Luisa. accessed 8 April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal gardening in the Italian and French manners was reintroduced at the turn of the twentieth century. [[Beatrix Farrand]]'s formal Italian garden areas at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Achille Duchêne]]'s restored French water parterre at [[Blenheim Palace]] in England are examples of the modern formal garden. The Conservatory Garden in [[Central Park]] of [[New York City]] features a formal garden, as do many other parks and estates such as [[Filoli]] in California.

The simplest formal garden would be a box-trimmed hedge lining or enclosing a carefully laid out [[flowerbed]] or garden bed of simple geometric shape, such as a [[knot garden]]. The more developed and elaborate formal gardens contain statuary and fountains.

===English Landscape and Naturalistic gardens===
{{Main|English garden|Landscape garden}} {{See also|List of landscape gardens}}
The [[landscape garden|English Landscape Garden]] style practically swept away the geometries of earlier English and European Renaissance formal gardens. [[William Kent]] and [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] were leading proponents, among many other designers. The naturalistic [[English garden|English Garden]] style (French:'' Jardin anglais'', Italian: ''Giardino all'inglese'', German: ''Englischer Landschaftsgarten'') of the 1730s and on transformed private and civic garden design across Europe. The [[French landscape garden|French Landscape Garden]] subsequently continued the style's development on the Continent.

===Cottage gardens===
{{Main|Cottage garden}}
A cottage garden uses an informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. Cottage gardens go back many centuries, but their popularity grew in 1870s England in response to the more structured Victorian [[English garden|English estate gardens]] that used restrained designs with massed beds of brilliantly colored greenhouse annuals. They are more casual by design, depending on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The influential British garden authors and designers, [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]] at [[Gravetye Manor]] in [[Sussex]], and [[Gertrude Jekyll]] at [[Munstead Wood]] in [[Surrey]], both wrote and gardened in [[England]]. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings were an influence in Europe and the United States. Also influential half a century later was [[Margery Fish]], whose surviving garden at [[East Lambrook Manor]] emphasizes, among other things, native plant life and the natural patterns produced by self-spreading and self-seeding.

The earliest cottage gardens were far more practical than modern versions—with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with fruit trees, beehives, and even livestock if land allowed. Flowers were used to fill any spaces in between. Over time, flowers became more dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-James, ''The Pleasure Garden'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations of the more traditional English cottage garden.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitchen garden or potager===
{{Main|Kitchen garden}}
[[Image:VillandryPotager.jpg|thumb|right|Formal potager at Villandry, France]]
[[Image:Shakespeare garden.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration from [[Walter Crane]]'s 1906 book,''Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden: a Posy from the Plays'']]
The traditional kitchen garden, also known as a potager, is a seasonally used space separate from the rest of the residential garden – the ornamental plants and lawn areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots with square or rectangular beds, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its history, but also its design.

The kitchen garden may be a [[landscape]] feature that can be the central feature of an ornamental, all-season landscape, but can be little more than a humble vegetable plot. It is a source of [[herb]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[flower]]s, but it is also a structured garden space, a design based on repetitive geometric patterns.

The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent [[perennials]] or woody plantings around (or among) the [[annual plants]].

===Shakespeare garden===
{{Main|Shakespeare garden}}

A Shakespeare garden is a themed garden that cultivates plants mentioned in the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, particularly the [[United States]], these are often public gardens associated with parks, universities, and Shakespeare festivals. Shakespeare gardens are sites of cultural, educational, and romantic interest and can be locations for outdoor weddings.

Signs near the plants usually provide relevant quotations. A Shakespeare garden usually includes several dozen species, either in herbaceous profusion or in a geometric layout with [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]] dividers. Typical amenities are walkways and benches and a weather-resistant bust of Shakespeare. Shakespeare gardens may accompany [[Tudorbethan architecture|reproductions of Elizabethan architecture]]. Some Shakespeare gardens also grow species typical of the Elizabethan period but not mentioned in Shakespeare's plays or poetry.

===Rock garden===
{{main|Rock garden}}
[[Image:RockGarden-NaturalStyle-19990622a.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A naturalistic rockery in England]]
[[File:Waterfall at Rock Garden, Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|[[Rock Garden, Chandigarh|Rock garden]] in [[Chandigarh]], [[India]]]]

A rock garden, also known as a rockery or an [[alpine garden]], is a type of garden that features extensive use of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[Rock (geology)|stones]], along with plants native to rocky or [[alpine climate|alpine]] environments.

Rock garden plants tend to be small, both because many of the species are naturally small, and so as not to cover up the rocks. They may be grown in troughs (containers), or in the ground. The plants will usually be types that prefer well-drained [[soil]] and less water.

The usual form of a rock garden is a pile of rocks, large and small, aesthetically arranged, and with small gaps between, where the plants will be rooted. Some rock gardens incorporate [[bonsai]].

Some rock gardens are designed and built to look like natural [[outcrop]]s of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane and plants are often used to conceal the joints between the stones. This type of rock garden was popular in Victorian times, often designed and built by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in modern campus or commercial [[landscape architecture|landscaping]], but can also be applied in smaller private gardens.

The [[Japanese rock garden]], in the west often referred to as ''Zen garden'', is a special kind of rock garden which contains few plants.
Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as [[landscape]] features in tropical countries such as [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=Thai Garden Style|year=1996|publisher=Asia Books Co., Ltd.|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy plastic liners to stop unwanted plant growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Rock Gardens|url=http://www.thaigardendesign.com/landscaping/2009/11/thai-rock-gardens.html|publisher=Thai Garden Design|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Maintenance a Pain?

===Native garden===
{{main|Natural landscaping}}
Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of [[native plants]], including trees, shrubs, [[groundcover]], and grasses which are [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the [[geographic area]] of the garden.
[[Image:Banksia spinulosa claret styles Georges River NP email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'', a Sydney local plant which attracts wildlife]]
Natural landscaping is adapted to the [[climate]], [[geography]] and [[hydrology]] and should require no [[pesticides]], [[fertilizers]] and watering to maintain, given that [[native plants]] have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years. However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or [[Landscape|weedy landscapes]].

Native plants suit today's interest in "[[low-maintenance]]" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without [[irrigation]] or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases.

Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time.

Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, [[pollinator]]s, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted [[introduced species]], [[cultivar]]s, and [[invasive species]]. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, or natural communities.&lt;ref name=Tallamy&gt;{{citation|title=Bringing Nature Home: How You Can Sustain Wildlife with Native Plants|author=Douglas Tallamy|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=9781604691467|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szK9uNKvTkQC|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no [[soil amendments]], irrigation, pesticides, and [[herbicide]]s for a lower maintenance, more [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] landscape.

===East Asian gardens===
{{Main|Chinese garden|Japanese garden|Japanese rock garden|Korean garden}}

Japanese and Korean gardens, originally influenced by [[Chinese garden]]s, can be found at [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples and historic sites, private homes, in neighborhood or city parks, and at historical [[landmark]]s such as [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples. Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the [[Western world]] and Japan are [[Japanese garden|gardens]] in the [[Japanese rock garden|''karesansui'' (rock garden)]] tradition. The [[Ryōan-ji]] temple garden is a well-known example. There are Japanese gardens of various styles, with plantings and often evoking ''wabi sabi'' simplicity. In [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], garden-making is a high art, intimately linked to the arts of [[calligraphy]] and [[ink painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26262/garden-and-landscape-design|title=Garden and landscape design: Japanese|accessdate=7 March 2008|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary garden===
[[File:Contemporarygarden2.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary garden]]
[[File:Contemporarygarden1.jpg|thumb|Contemporary water feature]]The contemporary style garden has gained popularity in the UK in the last 10 years. This is partly due to the increase of modern housing with small gardens as well as the cultural shift towards contemporary design {{who|date=April 2015}}. This style of garden can be defined by the use 'clean' design lines, with focus on hard landscaping materials like stone, hardwood, rendered walls. Planting style is bold but simple with the use of drifts of one or two plants that repeat throughout the design. Grasses are a very popular choice for this style of design. Lighting effects also play an integral role in the modern garden. Subtle lighting effects can be achieved with the use of carefully placed low voltage LED lights incorporated into paving and walls.

===Residential gardens===
{{See also|front garden|back garden}}
{{distinguish|forest garden}}
A residential or private domestic garden, is the most common form of garden and is in proximity to a [[house|residence]], such as the '[[front garden]]' or '[[back garden]]'. The front garden may be a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and local laws. While typically found in the [[yard (land)|yard]] of the residence, a garden may also be established on a [[Roof garden|roof]], in an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] or [[courtyard]], on a [[balcony]], in [[windowbox]]es, or on a [[Patio garden|patio]]. Residential gardens are typically designed at [[human scale]], as they are most often intended for private use. However, the garden of a [[great house]] or a large [[estate (house)|estate]] may be larger than a public park.

Residential gardens may feature specialized gardens, such as those for exhibiting one particular type of plant, or special features, such as [[rockery]] or [[water garden|water features]]. They are also used for growing [[herbs]] and [[vegetables]] and are thus an important element of [[sustainability]].

The '''Geographic Names Information System''' ('''GNIS''') is a database that contains name and locative information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the [[United States|United States of America]] and its territories. It is a type of [[gazetteer]].  GNIS was developed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in cooperation with the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.

The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded. Each feature receives a permanent, unique feature record identifier, sometimes called the GNIS identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=US Census County Based TIGER/Line® 2009 Data Dictionary: Entity, Joins, Attributes, and Domains |url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qea5SVUR?url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database never removes an entry, "except in cases of obvious duplication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=| last=Cartographic Users Advisory Council (CUAC) | title=2007 Agency Presentation Minutes | publisher=US Geological Survey | date=April 26–27, 2007 | location=Reston, VA | url=http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111180726/http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archivedate=11 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geographical Names Board of Canada''' ('''GNBC''') is a national committee with a secretariat in [[Natural Resources Canada]], part of the [[Government of Canada]], which authorizes the names used on official federal government maps of [[Canada]] created since 1897. The board consists of 27 members, one from each of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]], and others from departments of the [[Government of Canada]]. The board also is involved with names of areas in the [[Antarctic]] through the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

==Structure==
The [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] is provided by [[Natural Resources Canada]]. In addition to the provincial and territorial members are members from the following federal government departments: [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]], [[Canada Post Corporation]], [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], [[Elections Canada]], [[Library and Archives Canada]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]], Natural Resources Canada (including [[Geological Survey of Canada]] and [[Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation]]), [[Parks Canada]], [[Statistics Canada]], and the [[Translation Bureau]]. The Chair of the Geographical Names Board of Canada is Connie Wyatt Anderson from The Pas, Manitoba.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">'''Geovisualization''' or '''Geovisualisation''', short for ''Geographic Visualization'', refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of [[geospatial data]] through the use of [[interactive visualization]].

Like the related fields of [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"&gt;MacEachren, A.M. and Kraak, M.J. 1997 Exploratory cartographic visualization: advancing the agenda. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 23(4), pp. 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information visualization]] &lt;ref name= "Card99"&gt;[[Stuart K. Card]], Mackinlay, J.D., and Shneidermann, B. 1999. Reading in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kaumann Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"&gt;Jiang, B., and Li, Z. 2005. Editorial: Geovisualization: Design, Enhanced Visual Tools and Applications. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ME04"&gt;[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] 2004. Geovisualization for knowledge construction and decision support. IEEE computer graphics and applications, 24(1), pp.13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. [[GIS]] and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"&gt;Jiang, B., Huang, B., and Vasek, V. 2003. Geovisualisation for Planning Support Systems. In Planning Support Systems in Practice, Geertman, S., and Stillwell, J. (Eds.). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

==History==
The term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953, in an article by [[University of Chicago]] geographer Allen K. Philbrick. New developments in the field of computer science prompted the [[National Science Foundation]] to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, computer-aided design, signal processing, and user interface studies &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, B.H., DeFanti, T.A., and Brown, M.D. (Eds.). 1987. Visualization in Scientific Computing. Computer Graphics, 21(6). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

Geovisualization developed as a field of research in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of French graphic theorist [[Jacques Bertin]].&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt; Bertin’s work on cartographic design and information visualization share with the National Science Foundation report a focus on the potential for the use of “dynamic visual displays as prompts for scientific insight and on the methods through which dynamic visual displays might leverage perceptual cognitive processes to facilitate scientific thinking”.&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt;

Geovisualization has continued to grow as a subject of practice and research. The [[International Cartographic Association]] (ICA) established a Commission on Visualization &amp; Virtual Environments in 1995.

==Related Fields==
Geovisualization is closely related to other visualization fields, such as [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; and [[information visualization]].&lt;ref name= "Card99"/&gt; Owing to its roots in [[cartography]], geovisualization contributes to these other fields by way of the map metaphor, which “has been widely used to visualize non-geographic information in the domains of information visualization and [[domain knowledge]] visualization."&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"/&gt;  It is also related to [[UrbanSim|urban simulation]].

==Practical Applications==
Geovisualization has made inroads in a diverse set of real-world situations calling for the decision-making and knowledge creation processes it can provide. The following list provides a summary of some of these applications as they are discussed in the geovisualization literature.
E

=== Wildland fire fighting ===
Firefighters have been using sandbox environments to rapidly and physically model topography and fire for wildfire incident command strategic planning. The SimTable is a 3D interactive fire simulator, bringing sandtable exercises to life. The SimTable uses advanced computer simulations to model fires in any area, including local neighborhoods, utilizing actual slope, terrain, wind speed/direction, vegetation, and other factors. SimTable Models were used in Arizona's largest fire on record, the [[Wallow Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2149915.shtml?cat=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===
Geovisualizers, working with European foresters, used CommonGIS and Visualization Toolkit ([[VTK]]) to visualize a large set of spatio-temporal data related to European forests, allowing the data to be explored by non-experts over the Internet. The report summarizing this effort “uncovers a range of fundamental issues relevant to the broad field of geovisualization and information visualization research”.&lt;ref name= "GA07"&gt;Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Jankowski, P, Keim, D., Kraak, M.-J., MacEachren, A.M., and Wrobel, S. 2007. Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21(8), pp. 839-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team cited the two major problems as the inability of the geovisualizers to convince the foresters of the efficacy of geovisualization in their work and the foresters’ misgivings over the dataset’s accessibility to non-experts engaging in “uncontrolled exploration”. While the geovisualizers focused on the ability of geovisualization to aid in knowledge construction, the foresters preferred the information-communication role of more traditional forms of cartographic representation.&lt;ref name= "GA07"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
Geovisualization provides archaeologists with a potential technique for mapping unearthed archaeological environments  as well as for accessing and exploring archaeological data in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Geovisualization: an Example from the Catholme Ceremonial Complex. Archaeological Prospection, 13, pp. 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of geovisualization for archaeology are not limited to advances in archaeological theory and exploration but also include the development of new, collaborative relationships between archaeologists and computer scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Review of Exploring Geovisualization , Dykes, J., MacEachren, A.M., and Kraak, M.J. (Eds.). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, 2004. In Archaeological Prospection, 12, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Studies===
Geovisualization tools provide multiple stakeholders with the ability to make balanced environmental decisions by taking into account “the complex interacting factors that should be taken into account when studying environmental changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasco|first=Luis|last2=Asensio|first2=Cesar|last3=de Arcas|first3=Guillermo|date=2017-05-15|title=Communicating airport noise emission data to the general public|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303042|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=586|pages=836–848|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization users can use a [[georeference]]d model to explore a complex set of environmental data, interrogating a number of scenarios or policy options to determine a best fit.&lt;ref&gt;Danada, J., Dias, E., Romao, T., Correia, N., Trabuco, A., Santos, C., Serpa, J., Costa, M., Camara, A. 2005. Mobile Environmental Visualization. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban Planning===
Both planners and the general public can use geovisualization to explore real-world environments and model ‘what if’ scenarios based on spatio-temporal data. While geovisualization in the preceding fields may be divided into two separate domains—the private domain, in which professionals use geovisualization to explore data and generate hypotheses, and the public domain, in which these professionals present their “visual thinking” to the general public&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;—planning relies more heavily than many other fields on collaboration between the general public and professionals.

Planners use geovisualization as a tool for modeling the environmental interests and policy concerns of the general public. Jiang et al.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt; mention two examples, in which “3D photorealistic representations are used to show urban redevelopment [and] dynamic computer simulations are used to show possible pollution diffusion over the next few years.” The widespread use of the Internet by the general public has implications for these collaborative planning efforts, leading to increased participation by the public while decreasing the amount of time it takes to debate more controversial planning decisions.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;

The '''history of geography''' includes many [[history|histories]] of [[geography]] which have differed over time and between different cultural and political groups.  In more recent developments, geography has become a distinct academic discipline. 'Geography' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|γεωγραφία}} – ''geographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=geography |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a literal translation of which would be "''to describe or write about the Earth''". The first person to use the word "geography" was [[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BC). However, there is evidence for recognizable practices of geography, such as [[cartography]] (or map-making) prior to the use of the term geography.

==Egypt==

The known world of Ancient Egypt saw the Nile as the centre, and the world as based upon "the" river.  Various oases were known to the east and west, and were considered locations of various gods (e.g. [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]], for Amon)12 .  To the South lay the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]itic region, known as far as the 4th cataract.  [[Land of Punt|Punt]] was a region south along the shores of the Red Sea.  Various Asiatic peoples were known as Retenu, Kanaan, Que, Harranu, or Khatti ([[Hittites]]).  At various times especially in the Late Bronze Age Egyptians had diplomatic and trade relationships with [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]].  The Mediterranean was called "the Great Green" and was believed to be part of a world encircling ocean.  Europe was unknown although may have become part of the Egyptian world view in Phoenician times.  To the west of Asia lay the realms of [[Keftiu]], possibly [[Crete]], and Mycenae (thought to be part of a chain of islands, that joined Cyprus, Crete, Southern Italy, Sicily and later perhaps [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]] and the Balarics to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Montet, Pierre (2000), "Eternal Egypt" (Phoenix Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Babylon==

The oldest known world maps date back to ancient [[Babylon]] from the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A. Talbert 2009 147"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geography and Ethnography: Perceptions of the World in Pre-Modern Societies|author=Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A.

The accompanying text mentions seven outer regions beyond the encircling ocean. The descriptions of five of them have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Irving|last=Finel|title=A join to the map of the world: A notable discover|year=1995|pages=26–27|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In contrast to the ''Imago Mundi'', an earlier Babylonian [[world map]] dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A. Talbert 2009 147"/&gt;

==Greco-Roman world==
{{See also|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] saw the poet [[Homer]] as the founder of geography. His works the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' are works of literature, but both contain a great deal of geographical information. Homer describes a circular world ringed by a single massive ocean. The works show that the [[Greeks]] by the 8th century BC had considerable knowledge of the geography of the eastern Mediterranean. The poems contain a large number of place names and descriptions, but for many of these it is uncertain what real location, if any, is actually being referred to.

[[Thales]] of Miletus is one of the first known philosophers known to have wondered about the shape of the world. He proposed that the world was based on water, and that all things grew out of it. He also laid down many of the astronomical and mathematical rules that would allow geography to be studied scientifically. His successor [[Anaximander]] is the first person known to have attempted to create a scale map of the known world and to have introduced the [[gnomon]] to Ancient Greece.

[[File:Hecataeus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Reconstruction of the map of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].]]
[[Hecataeus of Miletus]] initiated a different form of geography, avoiding the mathematical calculations of Thales and Anaximander he learnt about the world by gathering previous works and speaking to the sailors who came through the busy port of Miletus. From these accounts he wrote a detailed prose account of what was known of the world. A similar work, and one that mostly survives today, is [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''. While primarily a work of history, the book contains a wealth of geographic descriptions covering much of the known world. Egypt, Scythia, Persia, and Asia Minor are all described,&lt;ref&gt;James Rennell. The geographical system of Herodotus, examined and explained, by a comparison with those of other ancient authors and with modern geography. Bulmer, 1800. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LZIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA672 p672]&lt;/ref&gt; including a mention of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sfHsgNIZum0C The Ancient History of Herodotus] By Herodotus. p200. (cf., Asia is well inhabited; but from India eastward the whole country is one vast desert, unknown and unexplored).&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Africa as a whole are contentious,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of the British Empire. CUP Archive, 1963. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ISg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 p56]&lt;/ref&gt; with Herodotus describing the land surrounded by a sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dieumsegelungafr00ml Die Umsegelung Afrikas] durch phönizische Schiffer ums Jahr 600 v. Chr. Geb (1800)&lt;/ref&gt; Though, historically the Indian sea was thought of an inland sea which was that round of the southern part of Africa is surrounded by the eastern part of Asia by connecting land, which inference only after the circumnavigation of Africa by [[Vasco da Gama]] was abandoned by the western cartographers of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Die umsegelung Asiens und Europas auf der Vega. Volume 2. By Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-SfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 p148]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, though, hold that the descriptions of areas such as India are mostly imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical thought. By Lalita Rana. Concept Publishing Company, 2008. p6&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Herodotus made important observations about geography. He is the first to have noted the process by which large rivers, such as the Nile, build up [[River delta|deltas]], and is also the first recorded as observing that winds tend to blow from colder regions to warmer ones.

[[Pythagoras]] was perhaps the first to propose a spherical world, arguing that the sphere was the most perfect form. This idea was embraced by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] presented empirical evidence to verify this. He noted that the Earth's shadow during an eclipse is curved, and also that stars increase in height as one moves north. [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] used the idea of a sphere to explain how the sun created differing climatic zones based on latitude. This led the Greeks to believe in a division of the world into five regions. At each of the poles was an uncharitably cold region. While extrapolating from the heat of the Sahara it was deduced that the area around the equator was unbearably hot. Between these extreme regions both the northern and southern hemispheres had a temperate belt suitable for human habitation.

===Hellenistic period===
These theories clashed with the evidence of explorers, however, [[Hanno the Navigator]] had traveled as far south as [[Sierra Leone]], and it is possible other Phoenicians had circumnavigated Africa{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. In the 4th century BC the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] traveled through northeast Europe, and circled the British Isles. He found that the region was considerably more habitable than theory expected, but his discoveries were largely dismissed by his contemporaries because of this. Conquerors also carried out exploration, for example, [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] and [[Gallic Wars|Germany]], expeditions/invasions sent by [[Augustus]] to [[Arabia Felix]] and [[Axum|Ethiopia]] ([[Res Gestae]] 26), and perhaps the greatest Ancient Greek explorer of all, [[Alexander the Great]], who deliberately set out to learn more about the east through his military expeditions and so took a large number of geographers and writers with his army who recorded their observations as they moved east.

The ancient Greeks divided the world into three continents, Europe, Asia, and [[Libya]] (Africa). The [[Hellespont]] formed the border between Europe and Asia. The border between Asia and Libya was generally considered to be the Nile river, but some geographers, such as Herodotus objected to this. Herodotus argued that there was no difference between the people on the east and west sides of the Nile, and that the [[Red Sea]] was a better border. The relatively narrow habitable band was considered to run from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to an unknown sea somewhere east of India in the east. The southern portion of Africa was unknown, as was the northern portion of Europe and Asia, so it was believed that they were circled by a sea. These areas were generally considered uninhabitable.

The size of the Earth was an important question to the Ancient Greeks. [[Eratosthenes]] attempted to calculate its circumference by measuring the angle of the sun at two different locations. While his numbers were problematic, most of the errors cancelled themselves out and he got quite an accurate figure. Since the distance from the Atlantic to India was roughly known, this raised the important question of what was in the vast region east of Asia and to the west of Europe. [[Crates of Mallus]] proposed that there were in fact four inhabitable land masses, two in each hemisphere. In Rome a large globe was created depicting this world. That some of the figures Eratosthenes had used in his calculation were considerably in error became known, and [[Posidonius]] set out to get a more accurate measurement. This number actually was considerably smaller than the real one, but it became accepted that the eastern part of Asia was not a huge distance from Europe.

===Roman period===

[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|300px|A 15th-century depiction of the [[Ptolemy world map]], reconstituted from Ptolemy's ''Geographia'' (c. 150)]]

While the works of almost all earlier geographers have been lost, many of them are partially known through quotations found in [[Strabo]] (64/63 BC – ca. AD 24). Strabo's seventeen volume work of geography is almost completely extant, and is one of the most important sources of information on classical geography. Strabo accepted the narrow band of habitation theory, and rejected the accounts of Hanno and Pytheas as fables. None of Strabo's maps survive, but his detailed descriptions give a clear picture of the status of geographical knowledge of the time. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s (AD 23 – 79) [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] also has sections on geography. A century after Strabo [[Ptolemy]] (AD 90 – 168) launched a similar undertaking. By this time the Roman Empire had expanded through much of Europe, and previously unknown areas such as the British Isles had been explored. The [[Silk Road]] was also in operation, and for the first time knowledge of the far east began to be known. Ptolemy's ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' opens with a theoretical discussion about the nature and techniques of geographical inquiry, and then moves to detailed descriptions of much the known world. Ptolemy lists a huge number of cities, tribes, and sites and places them in the world. It is uncertain what Ptolemy's names correspond to in the modern world, and a vast amount of scholarship has gone into trying to link Ptolemaic descriptions to known locations.

It was the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] who made far more extensive practical use of geography and maps. The [[Roman roads|Roman transportation system]], consisting of 55,000 miles of roads, could not have been designed without the use of geographical systems of measurement and [[triangulation]]. The ''[[cursus publicus]]'', a department of the Roman government devoted to transportation, employed full-time ''[[gromatici]]'' ([[Construction surveying|surveyors]]). The surveyors’ job was to gather topographical information and then to determine the straightest possible route where a road might be built. Instruments and principles used included [[sun dial]]s for determining direction, [[theodolite]]s for measuring horizontal angles,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Logan [http://www.historytoday.com/logan-thompson/roman-roads Roman Roads] Published in History Today Volume: 47 Issue: 2 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and [[triangulation]] without which the creation of perfectly straight stretches, some as long as 35 miles, would have been impossible. During the Greco-Roman era, those who performed geographical work could be divided into four categories:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael J. T. Lewis [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Izau5_ihmsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=roman+surveying&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=33EFUp7lAYmA2gX2qIHQDQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20surveying&amp;f=false Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome] Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Land surveyors determined the exact dimensions of a particular area such as a field, dividing the land into plots for distribution, or laying out the streets in a town.
* Cartographical surveyors made maps, involving finding latitudes, longitudes and elevations.
* Military surveyors were called upon to determine such information as the width of a river an army would need to cross.
* Engineering surveyors investigated terrain in order to prepare the way for roads, canals, aqueducts, tunnels and mines.

Around AD 400 a scroll map called the [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger Table]] was made of the known world, featuring the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] network. Besides the [[Roman Empire]] which at that time spanned from Britain to the Middle East and Africa, the map includes India, Sri Lanka and China. Cities are demarcated using hundreds of symbols. It measures 1.12&amp;nbsp;ft high and 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft long.
The tools and principles of geography used by the Romans would be closely followed with little practical improvement for the next 700 years.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Roman Roads&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==

A vast corpus of Indian texts embraced the study of geography. The [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]] contain elaborate descriptions of rivers and mountains and treat the relationship between physical and human elements.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Geography: Voice of Concern|author=Anu Kapur|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious scholar [[Diana Eck]], a notable feature of geography in India is its interweaving with Hindu mythology,&lt;ref name="eck2012india"&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: A Sacred Geography|author=Diana L. Eck|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No matter where one goes in India, one will find a landscape in which mountains, rivers, forests, and villages are elaborately linked to the stories and gods of Indian culture. Every place in this vast country has its story; and conversely, every story of Hindu myth and legend has its place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ancient period===

The geographers of ancient India put forward theories regarding the origin of the earth. They theorized that the earth was formed by the solidification of gaseous matter and that the earth's crust is composed of hard rocks (sila), clay (bhumih) and sand (asma).&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geographical thought|author=Lalita Rana|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories were also propounded to explain earthquakes (bhukamp) and it was assumed that earth, air and water combined to cause earthquakes.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt; The [[Arthashastra]], a compendium by [[Kautilya]] (also known as [[Chanakya]]) contains a range of geographical and statistical information about the various regions of India.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; The composers of the [[Puranas]] divided the known world into seven continents of dwipas, Jambu Dwipa, Krauncha Dwipa, Kusha Dwipa, Plaksha Dwipa, Pushkara Dwipa, Shaka Dwipa and Shalmali Dwipa. Descriptions were provided for the climate and geography of each of the dwipas.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt;

===Early Medieval period===

The Vishnudharmottara Purana (compiled between 300-350 AD) contains six chapters on physical and human geography. The locational attributes of peoples and places, and various seasons are the topics of these chapters.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; [[Varahamihira]]'s Brihat-Samhita gave a thorough treatment of planetary movements, rainfall, clouds and the formation of water.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt;  The mathematician-astronomer [[Aryabhata]] gave a precise estimate of the earth's circumference in his treatise [[Āryabhaṭīya]].&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; Aryabhata accurately calculated the Earth's circumference as 24,835 miles, which was only 0.2% smaller than the actual value of 24,902 miles.

===Late Medieval period===
The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicles Tuzuk-i-Jehangiri, Ain-i-Akbari and Dastur-ul-aml contain detailed geographical narratives.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; These were based on the earlier geographical works of India and the advances made by medieval [[Muslim]] geographers, particularly the work of [[Alberuni]].

China's coastline and river systems are clearly defined and precisely pinpointed on the map. "Yu" refers to [[Yu the Great]], a Chinese deity and the author of the ''[[Yu Gong]]'', the geographic chapter of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', dating to the 5th century BC from whence this map is derived.]]
In China, the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th century BC, during the beginning of the [[Warring States]] period (481 BC – 221 BC).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"/&gt; This work was the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' ('Tribute of Yu') chapter of the ''Shu Jing'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which describes the traditional [[Nine Provinces (China)|nine provinces]] of ancient China, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 500.&lt;/ref&gt; The nine provinces at the time of this geographical work were relatively small in size compared to those of modern China with the book's descriptions pertaining to areas of the [[Yellow River]], the lower valleys of the [[Yangtze]] and the plain between them as well as the Shandong peninsula and to the west the most northern parts of the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]]s along with the southern parts of modern-day [[Shanxi]] province.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"/&gt;

In this ancient geographical treatise, which would greatly influence later Chinese geographers and cartographers, the Chinese used the mythological figure of Yu the Great to describe the known earth (of the Chinese). Apart from the appearance of Yu, however, the work was devoid of magic, fantasy, Chinese folklore, or legend.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 501"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 501.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chinese geographical writing in the time of [[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] were of lesser quality and contained less systematic approach, this would change from the 3rd century onwards, as Chinese methods of documenting geography became more complex than those found in Europe, a state of affairs that would persist until the 13th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant maps found in archeological sites of China date to the 4th century BC and were made in the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]].&lt;ref name="hsu 90 93"&gt;Hsu, 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known reference to the application of a geometric grid and mathematically graduated scale to a map was contained in the writings of the cartographer [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a geographical section, which was often an enormous compilation of changes in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, taxable products, etc.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 508"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Chinese historian [[Ban Gu]] (32–92) most likely started the trend of the [[gazetteer]] in China, which became prominent in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period and [[Sui dynasty]].&lt;ref name="hsu 98"&gt;Hsu, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Local gazetteers would feature a wealth of geographic information, although its cartographic aspects were not as highly professional as the maps created by professional cartographers.&lt;ref name="hsu 98"/&gt;

From the time of the 5th century BC ''Shu Jing'' forward, Chinese geographical writing provided more concrete information and less legendary element. This example can be seen in the 4th chapter of the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (Book of the Master of Huainan), compiled under the editorship of Prince [[Liu An]] in 139 BC during the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC – 202 AD). The chapter gave general descriptions of [[topography]] in a systematic fashion, given visual aids by the use of maps (di tu) due to the efforts of Liu An and his associate Zuo Wu.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 507–508"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 507–508.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chang Chu]]'s ''Hua Yang Guo Chi'' (''Historical Geography of [[Szechuan]]'') of 347, not only rivers, trade routes, and various tribes were described, but it also wrote of a 'Ba Jun Tu Jing' ('Map of Szechuan'), which had been made much earlier in 150.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 517"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 517.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shui Jing'' (''Waterways Classic'') was written anonymously in the 3rd century during the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (attributed often to [[Guo Pu]]), and gave a description of some 137 rivers found throughout China.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 514"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 514.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, the book was expanded to forty times its original size by the geographers [[Li Daoyuan]], given the new title of ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' (''The Waterways Classic Commented'').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 514"/&gt;

In later periods of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) and [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), there were much more systematic and professional approaches to geographic literature. The Song dynasty poet, scholar, and government official [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) wrote the geographical treatise known as the ''Gui Hai Yu Heng Chi''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; It focused primarily on the [[topography]] of the land, along with the agricultural, economic and commercial products of each region in China's southern provinces.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 510"/&gt; The [[polymath]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) devoted a significant amount of his written work to geography, as well as a hypothesis of land formation ([[geomorphology]]) due to the evidence of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s found far inland, along with [[bamboo]] fossils found underground in a region far from where bamboo was suitable to grow. The 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty]] geographer [[Na-xin]] wrote a treatise of archeological topography of all the regions north of the Yellow River, in his book ''He Shuo Fang Gu Ji''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt; The Ming dynasty geographer [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) traveled throughout the provinces of China (often on foot) to write his enormous geographical and topographical treatise, documenting various details of his travels, such as the locations of small gorges, or [[mineral]] beds such as [[mica]] schists.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Xu's work was largely systematic, providing accurate details of measurement, and his work (translated later by Ding Wenjiang) read more like a 20th-century field surveyor than an early 17th-century scholar.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524"/&gt;

The Chinese were also concerned with documenting geographical information of foreign regions far outside of China. Although Chinese had been writing of civilizations of the Middle East, India, and Central Asia since the traveler [[Zhang Qian]] (2nd century BC), later Chinese would provide more concrete and valid information on the topography and geographical aspects of foreign regions. The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) Chinese diplomat [[Wang Xuance]] traveled to [[Magadha]] (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book ''Zhang Tian-zhu Guo Tu'' (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Jia Dan]] (730–805) wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the [[Persian Gulf]], and that the medieval [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]s (whom he called the people of the Luo-He-Yi country, i.e. [[Persia]]) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as [[lighthouse]] beacons for ships that might go astray.&lt;ref name="Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as [[al-Mas'udi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]]. The later Song dynasty ambassador Xu Jing wrote his accounts of voyage and travel throughout [[Korea]] in his work of 1124, the ''Xuan-He Feng Shi Gao Li Tu Jing'' (''Illustrated Record of an Embassy to Korea in the Xuan-He Reign Period'').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt; The geography of medieval [[Cambodia]] (the [[Khmer Empire]]) was documented in the book ''Zhen-La Feng Tu Ji'' of 1297, written by [[Zhou Daguan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt;

==Middle Ages==

===Byzantine Empire and Syria===
After the fall of the western [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], ruled from [[Constantinople]] and known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued to thrive and produced several noteworthy geographers. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (6th century) was a grammarian at [[Constantinople]] and authored the important [[Gazetteer|geographical dictionary]] ''Ethnica''.  This work is of enormous value, providing well-referenced geographical and other information about [[ancient Greece]].

The geographer [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] (6th century) authored the ''[[Synecdemus]]''  (prior to AD 535) in which he provides a table of administrative divisions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and lists the cities in each. The ''Synecdemus'' and the ''Ethnica'' were the principal sources of [[Constantine VII]]'s work on the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Themes]] or divisions of [[Byzantium]], and are the primary sources we have today on [[political geography]] of the sixth-century East.

George of Cyprus is known for his ''Descriptio orbis Romani'' ''(Description of the Roman world)'', written in the decade 600–610.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DonnerEgypt.html |title=Article: The Representation of Lower Egypt (by Herbert Donner)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929012106/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DonnerEgypt.html |archive-date=2013-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with Italy and progressing counterclockwise including [[Africa]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Diocese of the East|western Middle East]], George lists cities, towns, fortresses and administrative divisions of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire]].

===Islamic world===
{{Main article|Geography and cartography in medieval Islam}}

In the latter 7th century, adherents of the new religion of [[Islam]] surged northward out of [[Arabia]] taking over lands in which [[Jews]], [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[Christian]]s and [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] had been established for centuries. There, carefully preserved in the monasteries and libraries, they discovered the [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek classics]] which included great works of geography by Egyptian [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', along with the geographical wisdom of the [[China|Chinese]] and the [[Roman Architecture|great accomplishments]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]], who spoke only [[Arabic language|Arabic]], employed [[Christians]] and [[Jews]] to [[Translation Movement|translate]] these and many other manuscripts into Arabic.

The primary geographical scholarship of this era occurred in [[Iran|Persia]], today’s [[Iran]], in the great learning center the [[House of Wisdom]] at [[Baghdad]], today's [[Iraq]]. Early caliphs did not follow orthodoxy and so they encouraged scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Young, M. J. L., J. D. Latham and R. B.

[[Persian people|Persians]] who wrote on geography or created maps during the Middle Ages included:
	
* [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber or Jabir) (721– c. 815) Wrote extensively on many subjects, expanded on the wisdom of the Greek classics and engaged in experimentation in natural science. It is unclear whether he was Persian or Syrian.&lt;ref&gt;S.N. Nasr, "Life Sciences, Alchemy and Medicine", The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge, Volume 4, 1975, p. 412: "Jabir is entitled in the traditional sources as al-Azdi, al-Kufi, al-Tusi, al-Sufi. There is a debate as to whether he was a Persian from Khorasan who later went to Kufa or whether he was, as some have suggested, of Syrian origin and later lived in Iran".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]] (780–850) wrote ''The Image of the Earth'' (''Kitab surat al-ard''), in which he used the [[Geography (Ptolemy)]] of [[Ptolemy]] but improved upon his values for the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].
* [[Ibn Khurdadhbih]] (820–912) authored a book of administrative geography ''Book of the Routes and Provinces'' (''Kitab al-masalik wa’l-mamalik''), which is the earliest surviving Arabic work of its kind. He made the first quadratic scheme map of four sectors.
* Sohrab or Sorkhab&lt;ref&gt;[[Alhazen#Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; (died 930) wrote ''Marvels of the Seven Climes to the End of Habitation'' describing and illustrating a rectangular grid of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] to produce a world map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6XPcfjA1pIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=suhrab+rectangular+map+geography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N54sIUb431&amp;sig=XWqWGeMY8VaomZIM07Lja8x5_6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q54GUtajOYbR2wXL44HwBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=suhrab%20rectangular%20map%20geography&amp;f=false Cartography in Antiquity and the Middle Ages: Fresh Perspectives, New Methods] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brentjes, S.

*  [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi|Al-Balkhi]] (850–934)  founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].
* [[Estakhri|Al-Istakhri]] (died 957) compiled the ''Book of the Routes of States,'' (''Kitab Masalik al-Mamalik'') from personal observations and literary sources
* [[Al-Biruni]] (973–1052) described polar equi-[[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of the [[celestial sphere]].
* [[Abu Nasr Mansur]] (960–1036) known for his work with the spherical [[Law of sines|sine law]]. Wrote ''Book of Azimuths'' which is no longer extant.
* [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) wrote on earth sciences in his ''Book of Healing''.
*  [[Ibn al-Faqih]] (10th century) wrote ''Concise Book of Lands'' (''Mukhtasar Kitab al-Buldan'').
* [[Ibn Rustah]] (10th century) wrote a geographical compendium known as ''Book of Precious Records''.

Further details about some of these are given below:

In the early 10th century, [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] originally from [[Balkh]], founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]]. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.&lt;ref name = E61-3&gt;E. Edson and Emilie Savage-Smith, ''Medieval Views of the Cosmos'', pp. 61–3, Bodleian Library, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrāb, a late 10th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer, accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with [[equirectangular projection]] or cylindrical equidistant projection.&lt;ref name = E61-3/&gt; In the early 11th century, [[Avicenna]] hypothesized on the [[Geology|geological]] causes of [[mountain]]s in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027).

In mathematical geography, [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], around 1025, was the first to describe a polar equi-[[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of the [[celestial sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;David A.

[[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping [[City|cities]] and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the [[Middle East]] and western [[Indian subcontinent]]. He combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations to record degrees of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] and to measure the heights of [[mountain]]s and depths of [[valley]]s, recorded in ''The Chronology of the Ancient Nations''. He discussed [[human geography]] and the [[planetary habitability]] of the [[Earth]], suggesting that roughly a quarter of the Earth's surface is habitable by [[human]]s. He solved a complex [[Geodesy|geodesic]] equation in order to accurately compute the [[Earth]]'s [[circumference]].&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.9&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 16.8&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern value of 6,356.7&amp;nbsp;km.

By the early 12th century the [[Normans]] had overthrown the Arabs in [[Sicily]]. [[Palermo]] had become a crossroads for travelers and traders from many nations and the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] [[Roger II of Sicily|King Roger II]], having great interest in geography,  commissioned the creation of a book and map that would compile all this wealth of geographical information. Researchers were sent out and the collection of data took 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bagrow, Leo [https://books.google.com/books?id=OBeB4tDmJv8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Tabula+Rogeriana+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uM0BUtHrBaWgyAHr94DwBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Tabula%20Rogeriana%20origins&amp;f=false History of Cartography] Original publication: Precedent Publications, Chicago, 1985, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Al-Idrisi]], one of few Arabs who had ever been to France and England as well as Spain, Central Asia and Constantinople, was employed to create the book from this mass of data. Utilizing the information inherited from the classical geographers, he created one of the most accurate maps of the world to date, the [[Tabula Rogeriana]] (1154). The map, written in Arabic, shows the [[Eurasia]]n continent in its entirety and the northern part of Africa.

An adherent of [[environmental determinism]] was the medieval [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]] (776–869), who explained how the environment can determine the physical characteristics of the inhabitants of a certain community. He used his early theory of [[evolution]] to explain the origins of different [[human skin color]]s, particularly [[Black people|black skin]], which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] as evidence for his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Lawrence I. | year = 1982 | title = Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 268–307 [278] | doi=10.2307/3632188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Exploration of Asia}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], geographical knowledge in Europe regressed (though it is a popular misconception that they thought the world was flat), and the simple [[T and O map]] became the standard depiction of the world.

The trips of [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Marco Polo]] throughout Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Christian [[Crusade]]s of the 12th and 13th centuries, and the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries opened up new horizons and stimulated geographic writings.
The [[Mongols]] also had wide-ranging knowledge of the geography of Europe and Asia, based in their governance and ruling of much of this area and used this information for the undertaking of large military expeditions. The evidence for this is found in historical resources such as The Secret History of Mongols and other Persian chronicles written in 13th and 14th centuries. For example, during the rule of the Great Yuan Dynasty a world map was created and is currently kept in South Korea. See also: [[Chinese geography#Maps of the Yuan Dynasty|Maps of the Yuan Dynasty]]

During the 15th century, [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal supported explorations of the African coast and became a leader in the promotion of geographic studies. Among the most notable accounts of voyages and discoveries published during the 16th century were those by [[Giambattista Ramusio]] in Venice, by [[Richard Hakluyt]] in England, and by [[Theodore de Bry]] in what is now Belgium.

[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|350px|left|''Universalis Cosmographia'', the Waldseemüller wall map dated 1507, depicts the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and the [[Pacific Ocean]] separating Asia from the Americas.]]
Following the journeys of [[Marco Polo]], interest in geography spread throughout Europe. From around c. 1400, the writings of [[Ptolemy]] and his successors provided a systematic framework to tie together and portray geographical information. This framework was used by academics for centuries to come, the positives being the lead-up to the geographical enlightenment, however, women and indigenous writings were largely excluded from the discourse.
The European global conquests started in the early 15th century with the first Portuguese expeditions to Africa and India, as well as the conquest of America by Spain in 1492 and continued with a series of European naval expeditions across the Atlantic and later the Pacific and Russian expeditions to Siberia  until the 18th century.
European overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the "Old" and "New World"s producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]: a wide transfer of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the continents.
These  colonialist endeavours in 16th and 17th centuries revived a desire for both "accurate" geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations. The ''Geographia Generalis'' by [[Bernhardus Varenius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s world map are prime examples of the new breed of scientific geography.

The [[Waldseemüller map]] ''Universalis Cosmographia'', created by German cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in April 1507, is the first map of the Americas in which the name "America" is mentioned. Before this, the Native Americans referred to their land depending on their location, with one of the more commonly used terms being "Abya Yala", meaning "land of vital blood". These indigenous geographical discourses were largely ignored or appropriated by the European colonialists to make way for European thought. 

The Eurocentric map was patterned after a modification of Ptolemy's second projection but expanded to include the Americas.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: 2000 Years of Map Projections'', p. 33. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldseemuller Map has been called "America's birth certificate"&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, John R. [https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/maps.html The Map That Named America] Library of Congress Information Bulletin, September 2003, Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Waldseemuller|Waldseemüller]] also created printed maps called globe gores, that could be cut out and glued to spheres resulting in a globe.

This has been debated widely as being dismissive of the extensive Native American history that predated the 16th-century invasion, in the sense that the implication of a "birth certificate" implies a blank history prior.

=== 16th~18th centuries in the West ===
{{Unreferenced section|date= November 2017}}
Geography as a science experiences excitement and exerts influence during the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] and [[Reformation|Religion Reformation]]. In the Victorian period, the oversea exploration gave it institutional identity and geography was "the science of imperialism par excellence." Imperialism is a crucial concept for the Europeans, as the institution become involved in geographical exploration and colonial project. Authority was questioned, and utility gained its importance. In the era of Enlightenment, geography generated knowledge and made it intellectually and practically possible as a university discipline. The natural theology required geography to investigate the world as a grand machine from the Divine. Scientific voyages and travels constructed geopolitical power from geographical knowledge, partly sponsored by [[Royal Society]]. [[John Pinkerton]] appraised the eighteenth century had "the gigantic progress of every science, and in particular of geographical information" and "alteration has taken place in states and boundaries."

The discourse of geographical history gave way to many new thoughts and theories, but the hegemony of the European male academia led to the exclusion of non-western theories, observations and knowledges. 
One such example is the interaction between humans and nature, with Marxist thought critiquing nature as a commodity within Capitalism, European thought seeing nature as either a romanticised or objective concept differing to human society, and Native American discourse, which saw nature and humans as within one category.
The implied hierarchy of knowledge that perpetuated throughout these institutions has only been recently challenged, with the Royal Geographical Society enabling women to join as members in the 20th century.  

After [[English Civil War]], [[Samuel Hartlib]] and his Baconian community promoted scientific application, which showed the popularity of utility. For [[William Petty]], the administrators should be "skilled in the best rules of judicial astrology" to "calculate the events of diseases and prognosticate the weather." Institutionally, [[Gresham College]] propagated scientific advancement to a larger audience like tradesmen, and later this institute grew into Royal Society. [[William Cuningham]] illustrated the utilitarian function of cosmography by the military implement of maps. [[John Dee]] used mathematics to study location—his primary interest in geography and encouraged exploiting resource with findings collected during voyages. Religion Reformation stimulated geographical exploration and investigation. [[Philip Melanchthon|Philipp Melanchthon]] shifted geographical knowledge production from "pages of scripture" to "experience in the world." [[Bartholomäus Keckermann]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;separated geography from theology because the "general workings of providence" required empirical investigation. His follower, [[Bernhardus Varenius]] made geography a science in the 17th century and published ''Geographia Generalis'', which was used in [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s teaching of geography at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

Science develops along with [[empiricism]]. Empiricism gains its central place while reflection on it also grew. Practitioners of magic and astrology first embraced and expanded geographical knowledge. Reformation Theology focused more on the providence than the creation as previously. Realistic experience, instead of translated from scripture, emerged as a scientific procedure. Geographical knowledge and method play roles in economic education and administrative application, as part of the Puritan social program. Foreign travels provided content for geographic research and formed theories, such as environmentalism. Visual representation, map-making or [[cartography]], showed its practical, theoretical, and artistic value.

The concepts of "Space" and "Place" attract attention in geography. Why things are there and not elsewhere is an important topic in Geography, together with debates on space and place. Such insights could date back in 16th and 17th centuries, identified by M. Curry as "Natural Space", "Absolute Space", "Relational Space" (''On Space and Spatial Practice''). After [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s ''Principles of Philosophy'', [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] considered space as relative, which has long-term influence on the modern view of space. For Descartes, [[Pierre Gassendi|Grassendi]] and Newton, place is a portion of "absolution space", which are neural and given. However, according to John Locke, "Our Idea of Place is nothing else, but such a relative Position of any thing" (in ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''). "Distance" is the pivot modification of space, because "Space considered barely in length between any two Beings, without considering any thing else between them". Also, the place is "made by Men, for their common use, that by it they might be able to design the particular Position of Things". In the ''Fifth Paper in Reply to Clarke,'' Leibniz stated: "Men fancy places, traces, and space, though these things consist only in the truth of relations and not at all in any absolute reality". Space, as an "order of coexistence", "can only be an ideal thing, containing a certain order, wherein the mind conceives the application of relation". Leibniz moved further for the term "distance" as he discussed it together with "interval" and "situation", not just a measurable character. Leibniz bridged place and space to quality and quantity, by saying "Quantity or magnitude is that in things which can be known only through their simultaneous compresence--or by their simultaneous perception... Quality, on the other hand, is what can be known in things when they are observed singly, without requiring any [[compresence]]." In ''Modern Space as Relative'', place and what is in place are integrated. "The Supremacy of Space" is observed by E. Casey when the place is resolved as "position and even point" by Leibniz's rationalism and Locke's empiricism.

During [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], advancements in science mean widening human knowledge and enable further exploiting nature, along with industrialization and empire expansion in Europe. [[David Hume]], "the real father of positivist philosophy" according to [[Leszek Kołakowski|Leszek Kolakowski]], implied the "doctrine of facts", emphasizing the importance of scientific observations. The "fact" is related with sensationalism that object cannot be isolated from its "sense-perceptions", an opinion of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], Descartes, later [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and Newton advocated scientific [[materialism]], viewing the universe—the entire world and even human mind—as a machine. The mechanist world view is also found in the work of [[Adam Smith]] based on historical and statistics methods. In chemistry, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] proposed the "exact science model" and stressed quantitative methods from experiment and mathematics. [[Carl Linnaeus|Karl Linnaeus]] classified plants and organisms based on an assumption of fixed species. Later, the idea of [[evolution]] emerged not only for species but also for society and human intellect. In ''General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] laid out his hypothesis of cosmic evolution, and made him "the great founder of the modern scientific conception of Evolution" according to [[William Hastie|Hastie]].

[[Francis Bacon]] and his followers believed progress of science and technology drive betterment of man. This belief was attached by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who defended human emotions and morals. His discussion on geography education piloted local regional studies. Leibniz and Kant formed the major challenge to the mechanical materialism. Leibniz conceptualized the world as a changing whole, rather than "sum of its parts" as a machine. Nevertheless, he acknowledged experience requires rational interpretation—the power of human reason.

Kant tried to reconcile the division of sense and reason by stressing moral rationalism grounded on aesthetic experience of nature as "order, harmony, and unity". For knowledge, Kant distinguished [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] (''sensible'' world) and [[Noumenon|noumena]] (''intelligible'' world), and he asserted "all phenomena are perceived in the relations of space and time." Drawing a line between "rational science" and "empirical science", Kant regarded Physical geography—associating with space—as natural science. During his tenure in [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], Kant offered lectures on physical geography since 1756 and published the lecture notes ''Physische Geographie'' in 1801. However, Kant's involvement in travel and geographical research is fairly limited. Kant's work on empirical and rational science influence [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and at smaller extent [[Carl Ritter|Ritter]]. Manfred Büttner asserted that is "Kantian emancipation of geography from theology."

Humboldt is admired as a great geographer, according to D. Livingstone that "modern geography was first and last a synthesizing science and as such, if Goetzmann is to be believed, 'it became the key scientific activity of the age'." Humboldt met the geographer [[Georg Forster|George Forster]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], whose geographical description and scientific writing influenced Humboldt. His ''Geognosia'' including the geography of rocks, animals, and plants is "an important model for modern geography". As the Prussian Ministry of Mines, Humboldt founded the Free Royal Mining School at Steben for miners, later regarded the prototype of such institutes. German Naturphilosophie, especially the work of Goethe and Herder, stimulated Humboldt's idea and research of a universal science. In his letter, he made observations while his "attention will never lose sight of the harmony of concurrent forces, the influence of the inanimate world on the animal and vegetable kingdom." His American travel stressed the geography of plants as his focus of science. Meanwhile, Humboldt used empirical method to study the indigenous people in the New World, regarded as a most important work in human geography. In ''Relation historique du Voyage'', Humboldt called these research a new science ''Physique du monde, Theorie de la Terre,'' or ''Geographie physique''. During 1825 to 1859, Humboldt devoted in Kosmos, which is about the knowledge of nature. There are growing works about the New World since then. In the Jeffersonian era, "American geography was born of the geography of America", meaning the knowledge discovery helped form the discipline. Practical knowledge and national pride are main components of the Teleological tradition.

Institutions such as the [[Royal Geographical Society]] indicate geography as an independent discipline. [[Mary Somerville]]'s Physical Geography was the "conceptual culmination of ... Baconian ideal of universal integration". According to Francis Bacon, "No natural phenomenon can be adequately studied by itself alone -- but, to be understood, it must be considered as it stands connected with all nature."

==19th century==
[[File:Humboldt.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859).]]
By the 18th century, geography had become recognized as a discrete discipline and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in Europe (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]), although not in the United Kingdom where geography was generally taught as a sub-discipline of other subjects.

A holistic view of geography and nature can be seen in the work by the 19th-century polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the great works of this time was Humboldt's ''Kosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the Universe'', the first volume of which was published in German in 1845. Such was the power of this work that Dr Mary Somerville, of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] intended to scrap publication of her own ''Physical Geography'' on reading ''Kosmos''. Von Humboldt himself persuaded her to publish (after the publisher sent him a copy).

In 1877, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] published his Physiography with the philosophy of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] presented as an integrated approach in the study of the natural environment. The philosophy of universality in geography was not a new one but can be seen as evolving from the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. The publication of Huxley physiography presented a new form of geography that analysed and classified [[Causality|cause and effect]] at the micro-level and then applied these to the macro-scale (due to the view that the micro was part of the macro and thus an understanding of all the micro-scales was need to understand the macro level). This approach emphasized the empirical collection of data over the theoretical. The same approach was also used by [[Halford John Mackinder]] in 1887. However, the integration of the [[Geosphere]], [[Atmosphere]] and [[Biosphere]] under physiography was soon over taken by Davisian geomorphology.

Over the past two centuries the quantity of knowledge and the number of tools has exploded. There are strong links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]].

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in England in 1830, although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in United Kingdom geography was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became and continues to be a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education.

==20th century==
In the West during the second half of the 19th and the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: environmental determinism, regional geography, the quantitative revolution, and critical geography.

===Environmental determinism===
{{Main article|Environmental determinism}}
'''Environmental determinism''' is the theory that a people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. Prominent [[environmental determinism|environmental determinists]] included [[Carl Ritter]], [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], and [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. Popular hypotheses{{By whom|date=November 2016}} included "heat makes inhabitants of the tropics lazy" and "frequent changes in barometric pressure make inhabitants of temperate latitudes more intellectually agile."{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Environmental determinist geographers attempted to make the study of such influences scientific. Around the 1930s, this school of thought was widely repudiated as lacking any basis and being prone to (often bigoted) generalizations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Environmental determinism remains an embarrassment to many contemporary geographers, and leads to skepticism among many of them of claims of environmental influence on culture (such as the theories of [[Jared Diamond]]). {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Regional geography===
{{Main article|Regional geography}}
'''Regional geography''' was coined by a group of geographers known as possibilists and represented a reaffirmation that the proper topic of geography was study of places (regions). Regional geographers focused on the collection of descriptive information about places, as well as the proper methods for dividing the earth up into regions. Well-known names from these period are [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France. The philosophical basis of this field in United States was laid out by [[Richard Hartshorne]], who defined geography as a study of areal differentiation, which later led to criticism of this approach as overly descriptive and unscientific.

However, the concept of a Regional geography model focused on [[Area Studies]] has remained incredibly popular amongst students of geography, while less so amongst scholars who are proponents of Critical Geography and reject a Regional geography paradigm. It can be argued that Regional Geography, which during its heyday in the 1970s through early 1990s made substantive contributions to students' and readers' understanding of foreign cultures and the real world effects of the delineation of borders, is due for a revival in academia as well as in popular nonfiction.

===The quantitative revolution===
{{Main article|Quantitative revolution}}
The '''quantitative revolution''' in geography began in the 1950s. Geographers formulated geographical theories and subjected the theories to empirical tests, usually using [[statistical methods]] (especially [[hypothesis testing]]). This quantitative revolution laid the groundwork for the development of [[geographic information system]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], [[Edward Augustus Ackerman]] and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

===Critical geography===
{{Main article|Critical geography}}
Though positivist approaches remain important in geography, '''critical geography''' arose as a critique of positivism. The first strain of critical geography to emerge was [[humanistic geography]]. Drawing on the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], humanistic geographers (such as [[Yi-Fu Tuan]]) focused on people's sense of, and relationship with, places. More influential was [[Marxist geography]], which applied the social theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his followers to geographic phenomena. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]] are well-known Marxist geographers. [[Feminist geography]] is, as the name suggests, the use of ideas from [[feminism]] in geographic contexts. The most recent strain of critical geography is postmodernist geography, which employs the ideas of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] theorists to explore the social construction of spatial relations.

[[File:Imperi de la Corona d'Aragó.png|thumb|The [[Crown of Aragon]] began its expansion in the 13th century under [[James I of Aragon]], and by the 14th-16th centuries, its territories included the [[Duchy of Neopatras]] (in actual [[Greece]]), [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Sardinian nationalism|Isle of Sardinia]][[Corsica|, isle of Corsica]],  [[Kingdom of Majorca|Kingdom of Mallorca]], [[Kingdom of Valencia]], [[Principality of Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. '''All these united under one Crown, the Crown of Aragon.''']]
'''[[Cartography]] throughout the 14th-16th centuries''' played a significant role in the expansion of the kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for a multitude of reasons. Primarily, the [[map]]s developed during this period served as [[Iberian nautical sciences, 1400–1600|navigational tools]] for maritime folk such as explorers, sailors and navigators. Mostly the expansion of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (which included the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Majorca]], together with the [[Principality of Catalonia]], all its territories with seashore on the Mediterranean Sea. The Crown of Aragon controlled the routes across the Mediterranean Sea from the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to Europe, as part of the commercial-trade route known as the [[Silk Road]].

They were used to make the travel occurring at the time easier by eliminating the unnecessary resources spent when the most efficient route was not taken, and after things such as wind patterns and [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] began to appear on maps. they made maritime activities such as exploration or conquest less time- and resource-consuming. Maps were also used as a method to plan out landmasses by surveyors in areas that had yet to be explored or did not have many documented statistics. This often was the case in the Americas, where the Iberian empires did not start off with much documented evidence of the landmasses.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Bendall. "Introduction."

[[Image:Fernão Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fernão Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520–c. 1580). It belongs to the so-called ''plane chart'' model, where observed latitudes and magnetic directions are plotted directly into the plane, with a constant scale, as if the Earth were plane (Portuguese National Archives of Torre do Tombo, Lisbon).]]
Even still, oftentimes before the availability of maps began to increase, they were used as decorative pieces that were commonly gifted to individuals of very high social status such as kings or popes. Those particular maps frequently had descriptive legends, which usually consisted of drawings being integrated into the actual map. An example of such a map would be the heavily decorated [[Catalan Atlas]], which was produced in 1375. It was used as a gift to the [[King of france|King of France]] from the King of the [[Crown of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Edson55"&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dhgYlhXJy_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation]'' (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

One other purpose behind maps was [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]], and in those circumstances they were used to possibly distort or falsify information. The Dutch used a particular map, which was known as the 'Christian knight map' for this purpose during their [[Dutch Revolt|struggle for independence]] against Spain. In relation to both Spain and Portugal and their influences on each other in terms of cartography, there was one very significant and fairly obvious example that began to develop in the 15th century. The Portuguese had begun to use [[Scale (map)|scales]] of latitude on their nautical charts, and once Portuguese [[cosmography|cosmographers]] were being recruited by the [[Crown of Castile]], the same lines began to appear on Spanish charts as well, which eventually developed into what is known as a [[nautical chart|plane chart]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GxCv8jUEIsAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain]'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the map-making process==
Evolutionary-wise, the specific measurements used in sea charts began to have a practical impact on world maps beginning in the early 14th century with the inclusion of latitude and longitude. Before hand, cartographic works had been developed through less rational methods than mathematical, such as theology and cosmology, but did include statements of geography and history as well. The beginning of the 14th century also introduced the first [[atlas]], which was created through a series of maps being bound together. The new innovation was not just for show, however, as it had many practical uses due to its improved portability and durability, as well as making it easier for the readers to see. Map-making technique began an alteration through geographical thought. While not every map looked the same, a pattern of features developed through the round shape and typical inclusion of some sort of paradise, and were found on many of the maps of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation'' (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TO map.gif|thumb|left|Copy (1475) of [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore's]] [[T and O map]] of the world.]]
To better understand the map-making process, a step back in time is required, as Claudius Ptolemaeus, better known as [[Ptolemy]], whose eight-volume work entitled ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' played a large role in the development of cartography once it was translated into Latin in 1406. Ptolemy projected two different types of maps in his text. The first, known as a [[Map projection|conic projection]], dealt with the latitude parallels consisting of round arcs. The second, known as a pseudoconic projection, consisted of longitude lines being round.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World.'' (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's work were heavily influential in Islamic science as well, whose maps were quite similar to the Portolan charts and were partly influential on the Catalan map by Abraham Cresques.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J.W. Thrower. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Maps &amp; Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society]''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2008) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 14th century, many of the maps were known as [[T and O map]]s, termed because of a circle representing the earth, and within the circle a T-shape to designate the division of different known land masses, which were Europe, Africa, and Asia. This particular style was representative in the well-known Spanish [[Mappa Mundi]] which was developed a few centuries beforehand, but was also the first map to actually be printed in 1472. Some of these earlier maps relied heavily on Arabic influence, which is evident in the inclusion of frequent Arabic place names. It is thought that this information could have been gathered through experiences throughout different trade routes. The T-O style of map shows a lack of information regarding the specific details of land masses, but once trade began to flourish, so did the detail in maps.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Following the simplicity of the [[T-O map|T-O style]], maps began to grow into a greater, fantasy-inspired style. Where beforehand, the descriptiveness was minimal, maps now included beautiful drawings of angels and mythical creatures, and oftentimes these maps were used to understand what was considered to be the history. In the 15th century, maps began to develop an idea and representation of distinctive frontiers. Where the previous maps had indulged in fantastical depictions, terminology began to show up much more frequently now, such as names for regions and provinces.&lt;ref name="Harwood32-51"&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World''. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 32–51&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of an eastern orientation was one of the first things to change from the typical features of maps with the loss of fantastical creatures being depicted and the inclusion of more detailed landmasses, and it is possible that this was happening because Arabic influence was causing maps orientation to move away from the east and more toward the south.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portolan charts==
[[File:Jorge Aguiar 1492 MR.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Portolan chart by Jorge de Aguiar (1492), the oldest known signed and dated chart of Portuguese origin (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Yale, New Haven, USA)]]
The term portolan is derivative from ''portolano'' which translates from Italian into 'pilot's book.' While the orientation of earlier maps was generally in the east, and then it moved southward with the Arabic influence established throughout various trade routes, Portolan charts were oriented to the north to make them easier to read.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Short. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kV3ybVPTN3sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The World Through Maps: A History of Cartography]''. (Canada, Firefly Books, ltd: 2003) p.62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portolan charts]] began to surface just prior to the beginning of the 14th century, but the division of such a practical creation was very significant in the map-making world. They were specifically used to solve specific problems. Each chart was an individual, which is important in comparison to the typical map, which had to be studied often with some sort of text to accompany it. The development of Portolan charts is thought to have begun due to an increasing overseas trade empire.&lt;ref name="Harwood32-51"/&gt; Portolan charts were produced with a combination of chart and [[compass]], allowing sailors to venture out farther onto the open water without as significant of a fear of the hopelessness of getting lost. The manufacturer of the chart would draw a scaled distance along with compass bearings to create angles in order to connect the different areas. Using the chart, the sailor or navigator would set a course from one point to the next, and then use what are known as rhumb lines, which are lines of longitude that all cross the meridian at exactly the same angle, to translate the desired course onto a compass heading.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The charts included descriptive depictions of coastlines, as well as islands, which enabled seafarers who were accustomed to using such navigational tools as the compass to find their way to said coasts and islands at sea. Included on the chart were a series of thick lines that would be used along with the compass to gather ones bearings. Oftentimes the charts did not include any information on inland structures. There were exceptions, but they were few and usually limited to library copies.&lt;ref name="Newitt7"&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iv6L1WeiYd4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668]''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Not all maps designating information that would be most beneficial to Iberian empires were being produced in Portugal or Spain, and the same applied to the information utilized by the Portolan charts. Other maps were being produced in Italy and in Germany, both of which were incorporating not just geographical ideas, but religious and academic ideas as well. At the same time, they were using the information that Portuguese seamen had ambitiously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;   The charts of sailing directions expanded as new sailing routes became more prominent, such as what happened when the [[Canary Islands]] were initially discovered, followed by the discovery of other Atlantic islands. As was the case with general map-making, some of the charts began to incorporate decorative depictions in them as well. Navigational instruments like these did not just have a significant impact on the idea of space through the Iberian empires, but they also played a role in mobility as well. With the use of practical tools like the Portolan charts, people were able to more successful navigate and respectively move class-wise based upon said success.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish oceanic and land exploration and navigation==
Unlike the maps being created in Portugal, those produced in Spain were heavily guarded with an air of secrecy. The [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]] heavily guarded the maps and their advanced level of geographical knowledge because they did not want any of their rivals to be able to obtain them in any way to use against them or to use in order to expand their own empires into lands that Spain was eying. The protection of the maps from falling into undesirable hands was done by the prohibition of any of the maps to appear in print.  This prevented anybody who was not an active involved person in the business of Spain's empire to view the maps.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; With the printing of Spanish maps not just discouraged, but entirely restricted, there are very few that have survived. Cartography was not at all absent from the [[Spanish empire]]. Quite the contrary, they were used as an imperial effort to self-represent themselves as an Atlantic or global empire. A majority of this focus was placed upon the Indies and creating a spatial representation of structures that they had yet to examine, but needed to integrate with geographical data that they had already obtained in order to develop maps.

As mentioned previously, the revolution of Ptolemy’s rational thinking was what created such a powerful period in time when it came to [[cartography]], because it was uniting transparency with yet-to-be-realized political function. Spain utilized this through its [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American empire]]. At time, through cartography, Spanish culture has been able to elaborate on more than a two-dimensional idea of space, especially in the instances where climates are shown as a 'portion of the sphere.' That being said, outside of cartography, there is a lack of the idea of space in other aspects of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 40–49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Gutiérrez, the Americas, 1562.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Americae Sive Qvartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio'', 1562]]
 
With landmass structures, opposed to the original ocean-focus, becoming more popular on maps, two things began to change when it came to Spanish cartography. First of all, space was being considered in a different light, and secondly, the way maps were drawn began to change as well. Many of these changes were happening in result of the exploration of the [[New World]]. Where previously maps had been under close guard, availability began to increase. Not only that, but the significance of cartographic depiction followed a similar trend and geographical connotations were no longer limiting the way maps were developed.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In order to figure the best way to establish control of sovereign land, government officials of Spain began to record, in mass detail, about the territorial land of said establishments. They did not do this without significant prompting, but it still occurred. The information obtained to fill the requirements to take record was often taken from merchants who could provide accurate information based upon experience. Utilizing the significant information allowed for the Spanish empire to develop appropriate policies to incorporate into the expanding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Vaughn Scammell. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVGxcu9hUqMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The First imperial Age: European Overseas Expansion c. 1400-1715]''. (London, Unwin Hyman: 1989) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; While the extreme precautions taken to keep Spanish maps hidden might allude to the fact that maps were not a part of the imperial effort that was not the case. Maps were very much a part of the self-representations of Spain, which was able to show itself as an Atlantic empire through the cartographic lens. Through their efforts and ambitions, which were visually recorded on the relatively few Spanish maps that survived, Spain was able to facilitate a persistence of cultural trends.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Delving deeper into that, a representation of it can be made through the relationship between Spain and America, which is where a geometric rationalization really began to occur through cartography in terms of space. It was in the late sixteenth century when Spain was able to represent this idea through rationalizing the American Empire, which was beginning to spread a bit too thinly.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed into the 16th century, the development of Spanish maps began to increase, primarily those that were depicting the [[New World]]. The actual numerical amount of the maps is unknown, but it isn't thought to have been particularly low. The thing was, however, that they only existed in a manuscript form, and still only certain people were able to get their hands on said manuscript. That is still an improvement from how strictly the Spanish were guarding their maps in earlier centuries, but there was still an air of that protectiveness. For the most part, only people who were involved in the exploration or conquest of the New World were able to obtain the maps. There were a few exceptions to that particular rule that included people who were well-versed in Latin, educational publications for the learned, or being produced for those who were not within the boundaries of the Iberian land. Average readers who wanted to look at such a map would either have to gain access to a [[black market]] version or find a [[Woodblock printing|woodcut production]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese oceanic and land exploration and navigation==
Cartography played a large role in the establishment of the expansive Portuguese trade route, and similarly, the trade route played its role in Portuguese cartography. Maps included certain knowledge obtained solely through the connections Portugal had made through their trade routes in Africa and the East, although many of the maps unfortunately did not survive.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World.'' (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first fleets that were sent into the East by Portugal of which there were hopes to develop an economic and trade relationship between the two empires, the leaders of the expedition specifically hired pilots who would be able to gather accurate information in a geographical and navigational sense about the Indian Ocean. There was a map smuggled into Italy in 1502 of Portuguese origin that was documented evidence that the before mentioned pilots were able to gather accurate information, and with that, they created a picture of eastern Africa and western India that was both detailed and valid. As previously mentioned, not only did cartography have a cooperative relationship with the establishment of commerce, but the same applied in a reverse relationship as well. The early expeditions created the well-known [[Cantino map]], but they also were cause of the gathering of information dealing with trade within the Indian Ocean region, which was important in the establishment of Portugal's expansive trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
[[File:Brazil 16thc map.jpg|thumb|left|"Terra Brasilis", Miller Atlas, 1519, [[French National Library]].]]
It is important to note that not all of the information on charts and maps were limited to the seas and oceans, or even the coastlines for that matter.  That was primarily the case, but there were exceptions. There were copies of maps that did include information about land areas past the coast, though they were usually reserved for library use. An example of a map that did include land information, as well as trade information that surpassed what was typically on a map, was the [[Catalan Atlas]], which was dated 1375.&lt;ref name="Newitt7"/&gt; When the Portuguese explored coasts, for example the coast of West Africa, cartographers and navigators would carefully record progress. They were sure to include the names of the places they encountered, as well as doing their best to draw the coast. Unlike Spain, however, despite the fact that there was supposedly a policy of secrecy attached to these records, it was quite often that as soon as data from the voyages was obtained, it was almost instantly recorded for public use and knowledge. Specifically, cartographers began to include actual definition in the territorial land. Cities, rivers, and mountain ranges all began to show up on some maps, whereas others still just included the bare minimum of the outline of the coast. Building from that, maps began to take on an ornamental value. No longer were the purposes just restrained to the seeking of political and economic knowledge, but they became decorative.&lt;ref name="Edson55"/&gt; Building upon the evolution of cartography, the Portuguese went from simply incorporating the waters they traveled to incorporating land masses such as cities, mountains, and rivers. The Portuguese expanded map-making even further by the introduction of the representation of wind systems in the making of their maps.

Once they began to correctly understand the wind systems in both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they were able to use that knowledge in order to expand their global trade routes even further, which in turn established an even further spread out empire.  While the Portuguese were very innovative in their map-making, they still relied heavily on the cartographical knowledge of others, such as the Arabs, Japanese, and Chinese, when it came down to the actual observing and mapping of the global world. They did obtain their own information, but the maps were visibly a mixture of those observations, as well as other information that they had taken from other experts on cartography. The knowledge and the methods of obtaining information used by Portuguese cartographers drew upon the skill and knowledge of Muslim navigators. That being said, they still would conduct their own evaluations by writing down details they obtained when at port in other areas. The same applied to how they obtained some of their information of the land masses that were beginning to show up more and more in maps, opposed to the former method of just applying information regarding to the seas and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed into the late sixteenth century, Portugal’s ocean-based trade routes began to become more widely known. While their maps were not nearly as heavily guarded as those under the Hapsburg rule in Spain, they were still kept within Portugal. That began to change when those maps had started to appear abroad. Not only that, but Portuguese navigators began to take positions in other countries, which furthered the spread of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese also attempted to utilize cartography in order to integrate the [[indigenous people]] under colonial rule. Displacement of these indigenous populations did occur in under a cartographic lens, but despite that, a representation of imperial space was established.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Safier.

Akerman (ed.). ''The Imperial Map: Cartography and the Mastery of Empire''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2009) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ITM example 2007-06-05.jpg|right|300px|thumb|ITM coordinates on an OSi map from 2006. In this example the easting and the northing are separated by a comma.]]
[[Image:ITM map of Ireland.svg|right|300px|thumb|An illustration of ITM coordinates over a map of Ireland. Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]
'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.

==History==
The older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be "translated" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.

While the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.

The new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.

ITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.

While OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.

==Examples==

An ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].

The ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:

:715830, 734697

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])

The equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:

:315904, 234671

The Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.

The ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:

:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m

This ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an “E” and likewise an “N” for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.

With ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.
Every co-ordinate must be given with at least a six digit easting and northing from the false origin.

'''Landscape detailing''' describes the process of integrating soft landscape materials and hard landscape materials to create a [[landscape design]]. It requires knowledge of:
*[[Landscape architecture]]
*[[Landscape engineering]]
*[[Soft landscape materials]]
*[[Hard landscape materials]]
*[[Landscape products]]
Designing Landscape detailing can be boiled down to three different steps:Function, Structure, and Appearance. Function allows you to satisfy the requirements of the landscape to serve a purpose. Structure is the physical implementation of function through the best available resources; usually those of a local character. Appearance is about obtaining visual satisfaction, commonly known as aesthetic values.

Landscape detailing can influence the attitude and mood of a landscape. A study was conducted on how young people feel when in a natural oriented landscape versus an engineered habitat. The results showed that more structured landscapes are preferred in young people. Detailing in landscape allows the designer to make choices that help influence the landscape; allowing the potential to be shown.(1)

Landscape can have an influence on how communities and societies evolve and vice verse. Communities can shape how the landscape is used based on the needs of the community. We can see an example of this in Canada's landscape and the role the railroads had in shaping the community. With the introduction of the railroad, Canada's wild lands were more susceptible to exploitation. On the contrary to that, the railroad system also allowed the community to experience Canada's array of National Parks.(2)

Landscape detailing is not just limited to actual land, but can also be seen as a way to improve waterfront area; making the waterfront a more appealing setting for the public to enjoy. Typically when addressing the relationship of landscape detailing and water, we think of drainage and how the landscape can be manipulated to serve the user; as to prevent flooding and maintain water flows.(3)

With today's every expanding technologies, there has been an increase in ways to convey landscape detailing. The visualization tools can be split into two categories; traditional and computerized. Traditional ways to convey details in the landscape would be simply a pen/pencil, paper maps, and models; while the computerized way would to use GIS, 3D virtual modelling,or simulations using layers of photography to convey urban areas that have potential to be molded. (4)

Aesthetics are an important part of Landscape Detailing,the visual quality of a landscape is what is noticed by others and therefore the goal is to achieving pleasing aesthetic without creating a synthetic feel. Art and design are also qualities that enhance the landscape. Artistic influence has a direct role in planning a landscape.(5)

This is a list of [[mountain range]]s on [[Earth]] and a few other [[astronomical object|astronomical bodies]]. First, the highest and longest mountain ranges on Earth are listed, followed by more comprehensive alphabetical lists organized by continent. Ranges in the oceans and on other celestial bodies are listed afterwards.

== Mountain ranges on Earth==

===By height=== 
#[[Mahalangur Himal]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|Nepal}}, {{flag|India}}, {{flag|China}},  {{flag|Pakistan}}, {{flag|Bhutan}}; highest point: [[Everest]], 8848 meters above sea level.
#[[Karakoram]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|Pakistan}}, {{flag|China}}, {{flag|India}}; highest point: [[K2]], 8611 meters above sea level.
#[[Hindu Kush]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|Afghanistan}}, {{flag|Pakistan}}, {{flag|India}}; highest point: [[Tirich Mir]], 7708 meters above sea level.
#[[Pamirs]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|Tajikistan}}, {{flag|Kyrgyzstan}}, {{flag|China}}, {{flag|Afghanistan}}; highest point: [[Kongur Tagh]], 7649 meters above sea level, a peak included in the "Eastern Pamirs"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/93TC00767/abstract

|accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; more often than in the [[Kunlun Mountains]], as Kongur Tagh and the Kunlun range are ''separated'' by the large [[Yarkand River]] valley; no valley of such significance separates the Pamirs and Kongur Tagh, just political boundaries.
#[[Hengduan Mountains]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|China}}, {{flag|Myanmar}}; highest point: [[Mount Gongga]], 7556 meters above sea level. 
#[[Tian Shan]] – Asia: {{flag|China}}, {{flag|Kyrgyzstan}}, {{flag|Kazakhstan}}, {{flag|Uzbekistan}}; highest point: [[Jengish Chokusu]], 7439 meters above sea level.
#[[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia: {{flag|China}}; highest point: [[Liushi Shan]], 7167 meters above sea level.
#[[Nyenchen Tanglha]] (part of Greater Himalayas) – Asia; {{flag|China}}; highest point: [[Mount Nyenchen Tanglha]], 7162 meters above sea level.
#[[Andes]] – South America: {{flag|Argentina}}, {{flag|Chile}}, {{flag|Peru}}, {{flag|Bolivia}}, {{flag|Ecuador}}, {{flag|Colombia}}, {{flag|Venezuela}}; highest point: [[Aconcagua]], 6962 meters above sea level.
#[[Alaska Range]] – North America: {{flag|United States}}; highest point: [[Denali]], 6194 meters above sea level.

All of the Asian ranges above have been formed in part over the past 35 to 55 million years by the collision between the [[Indian Plate]] and [[Eurasian Plate]]. The Indian Plate is still particularly mobile and these mountain ranges continue to rise in elevation every year; of these the Himalayas are rising most quickly; the [[Kashmir]] and [[Pamirs]] region to the north of the Indian subcontinent is the point of confluence of these mountains which encircle the [[Tibetan Plateau]] on three sides.

While [[compass surveying]], the magnetic needle is sometimes disturbed from its normal position under the influence of external attractive forces. Such a disturbing influence is called as '''local attraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;surveying volume 1 by Dr B.c Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Chapter Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt; The external forces are produced by sources of local attraction which may be current carrying wire (magnetic materials) or [[metal]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by prof. Sk Duggal available on internet from Google books&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to denote amount of deviation of the needle from its normal position. It mostly causes errors in observations while [[surveying]] and thus suitable methods are employed to neglect these errors.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher ,Principal of Mehar chand Polytechnic College, [[Jalandhar]] City, [[Punjab]]/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The sources of local attraction may be natural or artificial. Natural sources include [[Iron ores]] or magnetic rocks while as artificial sources consist of steel structures, iron pipes, current carrying [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]]. The [[iron]] made [[surveying]] instruments such as metric chains, ranging rods and arrows should also be kept at a safe distance apart from [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Aftab Ahmad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Local attraction at a place can be detected by observing bearings from both ends of the line in the area. If fore bearing and back bearing of a line differ exactly by 180°, there is no local attraction at either station. But if this difference is not equal to 180°, then local attraction exists there either at one or both ends of the line.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Cl Kocher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==
There are two common methods of correcting observed bearings of the lines taken in the area affected by Local Attraction. The first method involves '''correcting the bearing with the help of corrected included angles''' and the second method involves correcting the '''bearing of traverse from one correct bearing''' ( in which difference between fore bearing and back bearing is exactly equal to 180°) by the process of distribution of error to other bearings.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. Bc Punmia/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mountain research''' or ''[[Mountain research#Denomination|montology]]'', traditionally also known as ''orology''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orology Merriam Webster&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' ὄρος for 'mountain' and ''logos'' λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the [[Earth's surface]]'s part covered by [[mountain]] [[landscape]]s.

==Mountain areas==
Different approaches have been developed to define ''mountainous'' areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 [[meter|m]] inside an area to define that zone as mountainous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1553/eco.mont-5-1s3 | volume=5 | title=Editorial | journal=eco.mont (Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research) | pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; others consider differences from 1000 m or more,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.293.aspx.pdf Mountain Systems. UNEP&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the areas' [[latitude]]. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding [[high plateau]]s (e.g. the Andean [[Altiplano]] or the [[Tibetan Plateau]]), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], which classifies municipalities as mountainous

* if at least 80% of their territory is situated above ≥ 600 m [[above sea level]], and/or 
* if they have an altitudinal difference of 600 m (or more) within their administrative boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/147760 Precisazione sulla classificazione dei comuni montani&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] has produced a map&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&amp;layers=0a5d90defc33466cbc3eb85a6564b6d6 UNEP-WCNC (2011): Mountains of the World – 2000. Map&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://old.unep-wcmc.org/mountains-and-forests-in-mountains-2000_723.html UNEP-WCNC (2011): Mountains of the World – 2000. Data&lt;/ref&gt; of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with

* elevations from 300 to 1000 m and local elevation range [[Greater-than sign|&gt;]] 300 m;
* elevations from 1000 to 1500 m and slope [[≥]] 5[[°]] or local elevation range &gt; 300 m;
* elevations from 1500 to 2500 m and slope ≥ 2°;
* elevations of 2500 m or more.

==Focus==

===Broader definition===
In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research ''in'' mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan [[Plant (botanical)|plants]], Andean [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], Alpine [[City|cities]], or Carpathian [[Ethnic group|people]]. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] (polar research) or [[coast]]s (coastal research).

===Narrower definition===
In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses ''on'' mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the [[Integrated geography|human-environment interaction]] in ([[Positive science|positive]]) and the [[sustainable development]] of ([[normative]]) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]]. Drawing on [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s work in the [[Andes|Andean realm]], [[Geography|mountain geography]] and [[Landscape ecology|ecology]] are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from [[anthropology]], [[geology]], [[economics]], [[history]] or [[spatial planning]]. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. [[Olav Slaymaker|Slaymaker]] summarizes:

{{Quotation|The science of montology [...] starts with recognition of the importance of verticality, a distinctive feature of mountain regions, which imposes vertical control of the production system; marginality, which results from low agricultural potential; centrality of mechanisms of power and violence; population growth and expansion; and religion and myth, expressed in mountains as sacred places. Montology emphasises restoration ecology to include re-vegetation, rehabilitation, reclamation and recovery of the lost landscape form and function [...]. Landscape ecological effects are arranged along altitudinal belts and form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of critical habitats for conservation and development. This approach has an underlying assumption of climax communities each fitting into a narrow altitudinal band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slaymaker | first1 = O | year = 2007 | title = The potential contribution of geomorphology to tropical mountain development: The case of the MANRECUR project | url = | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 87 | issue = 1–2| pages = 90–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.06.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denomination==
Mountain research or ''orology''—not to be confused with [[orography]]—, is sometimes denominated ''montology''. This term stems from Carl Troll's ''mountain geoecology''—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German ''[[Landscape ecology|Landschaftsökologie]]''—and appeared at a meeting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neustadtl | first1 = SJ | year = 1977 | title = Montology: the Ecology of Mountains | url = | journal = Technology Review | volume = 79 | issue = 8| pages = 64–66 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oed.com/public/update0212/december-2002-update&lt;/ref&gt; It defines montology as:

{{Quotation|The study of mountains; specifically the interdisciplinary study of the physical, chemical, geological, and biological aspects of mountain regions; (also) the study of the lifestyles and economic concerns of people living in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/montology&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the one hand, the term ''montology'' received criticism due to the mix of [[Latin language|Latin]] (''mōns'', [[Plural|pl.]] ''montēs'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''logos''). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as [[glaciology]] or [[sociology]].

The '''Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics''' ('''NUTS'''; {{lang-fr|Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques}}) is a [[geocode]] [[standardization|standard]] for referencing the [[country subdivision|subdivisions]] of [[country|countries]] for statistical purposes.&lt;ref name="ramon01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts|title=NUTS – Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecwiki01"&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/NUTS European Commission wiki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219053638/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/NUTS |date=19 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurlex01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R0176:EN:NOT |title=Regulation (EC) No 176/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurlex02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005R1888:EN:NOT |title=Regulation (EC) No 1888/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurlex03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007R0105:EN:NOT |title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 105/2007 of 1 February 2007 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurlex04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1059:EN:NOT |title=Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is developed and regulated by the [[European Union]], and thus only covers the [[Member State of the European Union|member states of the EU]] in detail. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is instrumental in the European Union's [[Structural Fund]] delivery mechanisms and for locating the area where goods and services subject to European [[Government procurement in the European Union|public procurement]] legislation are to be delivered.

For each EU member country, a hierarchy of three NUTS levels is established by [[Eurostat]] in agreement with each member state; the subdivisions in some levels do not necessarily correspond to [[administrative division]]s within the country. A NUTS code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, which is identical to the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code (except ''UK'' instead of ''GB'' for the United Kingdom and ''EL'' instead of ''GR'' for Greece). The subdivision of the country is then referred to with one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. Where the subdivision has more than nine entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]], but they are not technically part of NUTS governed by the regulations.

The current NUTS classification, valid from 1 January 2015, lists 98 regions at NUTS 1, 276 regions at NUTS 2 and 1342 regions at NUTS 3 level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview Official Eurostat website: NUTS Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commission Regulation 2016/2066, dated 21 November 2016, provides for a further amendment following territorial reorganisations in several member states, which will become effective for submission of statistical data to the European Commission from 1 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending the annexes to Regulation (EC) 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three levels of NUTS defined, with two levels of [[local administrative unit]]s (LAUs) below. These were called NUTS levels 4 and 5 until July 2003, but were officially abolished by regulation, although they are sometimes still described as such. Note that not all countries have every level of division, depending on their size. One of the most extreme cases is Luxembourg, which has only LAUs; the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself.

==Establishment==
NUTS regions are generally based on existing national administrative subdivisions. In countries where only one or two regional subdivisions exist, or where the size of existing subdivisions is too small or too large, a second and/or third level is created. This may be on the first level (ex. France, Italy, Greece, and Spain), on the second (ex. Germany) and/or third level (ex. Belgium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nuts/basicnuts_regions_en.html |title=Europa – Eurostat – Regions – Basic principles of the NUTS |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In smaller countries, where the entire country would be placed on the NUTS 2 or even NUTS 3 level (ex. Luxembourg, Cyprus), the regions at levels 1, 2 and 3 are identical to each other (and also to the entire country), but are coded with the appropriate length codes levels 1, 2 and 3.

The NUTS system favors existing administrative units, with one or more assigned to each NUTS level.

From the NUTS Regulation, the average population size of the regions in the respective level shall lie within the following thresholds:

{| class="wikitable"
|+
! Level !! Minimum !! Maximum
|-
| NUTS 1
| 3 million
| 7 million
|-
| NUTS 2
| 800,000
| 3 million
|-
| NUTS 3
| 150,000
| 800,000
|}

For non-administrative units, deviations exist for particular geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances, especially for islands and outermost regions.

==Examples==
* DE: Germany
** DE7: [[Hessen]] – The ''[[States of Germany|Bundesland]]'' as the top level subdivision of Germany
*** DE71: [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt region]] – ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' as second level
**** DE71E: [[Wetteraukreis]] – ''[[Districts of Germany|Kreis]]'' as the third level

The '''OrthoGraph I''' is a building survey and floor plan creation application for iOS and Android, developed in Hungary. It handles both structured alphanumeric data, and measures and handles all drawings real time in 3D. It has built-in Cloud functionality so files can be shared on multiple tablets or phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OrthoGraph|first1=OrthoGraph|title=OrthoGraph's website|url=http://www.orthograph.net|website=orthograph.net|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard output of the system can be [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]] (AutoCAD), [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (Adobe) [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] (Industrial Foundation Classes), JPG and PNG and it can be exported to [[ArchiCAD]] with the help of a separate module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geo-matching.com|title=GEo-Matching-database|url=http://www.geo-matching.com/products/id2820-orthograph-architect.html|website=www.geo-matching.com/products/id2820-orthograph-architect.html|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the measurement process, Leica, Bosch and Stabila laser distance meters are supported to use, the measured data is transferred to the software via Bluetooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Jack|title=Company Spotlight|url=http://www.bimcrunch.com/company-spotlight-orthograph/|website=www.bimcrunch.com/company-spotlight-orthograph/|publisher=BIMcrunch|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OrthoGraph I has several features that are unique on the market of building surveying applications. The base of a floor plan needs to be drawn first and after measurements the created floor plans will adjust based on the calculations. Diagonal measurements also allow for mathematical accuracy.

The application handles the sketched and measured building-model according to the [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Building Information Modeling) concept. It means that it handles a hierarchical location-structure, every placed object has several properties, doors and windows have opening directions, and additionally there is the opportunity to add unique parameter fields with optional information.
The system is developed by the Hungarian Company named OrthoGraph.

==Company history==

The story of OrthoGraph goes back to 2004 when the first version of the software was launched for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] devices. In 2011, the iPad version of the app was released and this also meant that a new business model has been emerged.
This new version was a major breakthrough both in technological and in business aspects. The company’s gathered experience had been a good background for developing the iPad application, so from the very first moment, the OrthoGraph became one of the top professional building surveying /CAD application on the market.

In 2013, a cooperation agreement has been established between OrthoGraph and Leica, the result of this collaboration was that now several Leica laser distance meter is supported by OrthoGraph, the measurements can be transferred to the app via Bluetooth connection.

In the second half of the year, the company decided to exploit the benefits of the mobile technology and the Internet and created their own [[Cloud computing|cloud]] services. This new technology has made it possible that the first building surveying software that provides the opportunity of real teamwork was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laszlo|first1=Toth|title=OrthoGraph Cloud Introduced|url=http://orthograph.blogspot.hu/2013/11/orthograph-cloud-introduced-try-it-for.html|website=orthograph.blogspot.hu|publisher=OrthoGraph Blog|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the Bluetooth support of the Bosch GLM 100 C laser distance meter for OrthoGraph became available.
For 2014, the number of  OrthoGraph users reached 4,500. In August 2014, the OrthoGraph Architect App has been named the gold winner in App of the Year category and silver winner in the Most Innovative Product of the Year—SMB category in Best in Biz Awards 2014 International business awards program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frausto-Robledo|first1=Anthony|title=OrthoGraph wins Best in Biz|url=http://architosh.com/2014/07/orthograph-wins-best-in-biz-award-for-app-of-the-year/|website=architosh.com|publisher=Architosch|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the main goal for OrthoGraph was to be present on Android. After one and a half year on September 2016 the multiplatform version of the app was published, which was called OrthoGraph I. The completely changed UI was simpler, the features were more advanced to allow more accurate measurements and a faster work process. After 2 months of the release, OrthoGraph I won silver qualification in the "Best New Version of the Year" category of Best in Biz Awards 2016.

[[File:Fictional Map With Romer.jpg|right|250px]]

A '''Reference Card''' or '''"Romer"'''&lt;ref&gt;War Office, ''Manual of map reading, photo reading and field sketching 1929'', [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; is a device for increasing the accuracy when reading a [[grid reference]] from a [[map]]. Made from transparent plastic, paper or other materials, they are also found on most baseplate compasses. Essentially, it is a specially marked-out [[ruler]] which matches the scale of the map in use. The scales are laid out in reverse, such that by lining up the numbers given in the grid reference with the gridlines for the square in question, the corner of the Romer lies on the location whose [[grid reference]] you wish to read. Some transparent versions have a small hole at the origin when this is not at the corner of the Reference Card. This allows access to the map such that the location could be marked with a pencil if using the Reference Card in reverse having been given a [[grid reference]] to start with. They are used in many types of land navigation and map reading, to give a more accurate [[grid reference]] than one just estimated by eye from the grid lines on the map.

While Romers of various designs are available commercially, they can easily be made yourself; by hand, by using a computer or by finding a website&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224023511/http://www.merlins-pyramid.com/bush/romer.html  archived copy of Merlin's Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt; with instructions.

Invented in 1915 by Temporary Lieutenant (later Captain) Carrol Romer, MC, RE (1883-1951), then “Maps”, First Army: i.e. OC Maps and Printing Section, such Reference Cards were widely used by the British Army in WW1 and after, being described in a Maps GHQ booklet ''Maps and Artillery Boards'' in December 1916: the name '''"Romer"''' seems only to have been used officially from 1929.&lt;ref&gt;R T Porter, ''Romer and his Romer'', Sheetlines (Journal of [https://charlesclosesociety.org/ The Charles Close Society]) 63, page 39, and ''Romer and his Romer: an Addendum'', Sheetlines 64, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
A version was later developed for car navigational rallies by car rally partners Eric Gardner and John Cridford during the early 1950s, the 'Garford Romer' was available for both Imperial and Metric OS maps and is still sold today. Although a registered design when it was first made and sold it was and still is much copied.

The illustration below shows how the Romer is used. Here, we are plotting the reference 696018. The marks corresponding to (6, 8) on the Romer are lined up along the gridlines (69, 01). The hole near the corner yields the exact point, the church at Little Plumpton.

'''Satellite imagery''' (also '''Earth observation imagery''' or '''spaceborne photography''') are [[image]]s of [[Earth]] or other planets collected by [[Earth observation satellite|imaging satellite]]s operated by governments and businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as [[Apple Maps]] and [[Google Maps]].

== History ==
[[Image:First satellite photo - Explorer VI.jpg|thumb| The satellite images were made from pixels. The first crude image taken by the satellite [[Explorer 6]] shows a sunlit area of the Central Pacific Ocean and its cloud cover. The photo was taken when the satellite was about {{convert|17000|mi|km|abbr=on}} above the surface of the earth on August 14, 1959. At the time, the satellite was crossing Mexico.]]

The first images from space were taken on [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital flights]]. The U.S-launched [[V-2]] flight on October 24, 1946 took one image every 1.5 seconds. With an apogee of 65 miles (105&amp;nbsp;km), these photos were from five times higher than the previous record, the 13.7 miles (22&amp;nbsp;km) by the Explorer II balloon mission in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/FEATURE-FirstPhoto.html The First Photo From Space], Tony Reichhardt, ''Air &amp; Space Magazine'', November 01, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first satellite (orbital) photographs of Earth were made on August 14, 1959 by the U.S. [[Explorer 6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Year_2007/SEMP4FEVL2F_0.html | title=50 years of Earth Observation | work=2007: A Space Jubilee | publisher=[[European Space Agency]] | date=October 3, 2007 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html |title=First Picture from Explorer VI Satellite |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130171224/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html |archivedate=2009-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first satellite photographs of the [[Moon]] might have been made on October 6, 1959 by the Soviet satellite [[Luna 3]], on a mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. [[The Blue Marble]] photograph was taken from space in 1972, and has become very popular in the media and among the public. Also in 1972 the United States started the [[Landsat program]], the largest program for acquisition of imagery of Earth from space. [[Landsat Data Continuity Mission]], the most recent Landsat satellite, was launched on 11 February 2013. In 1977, the first real time satellite imagery was acquired by the United States's [[KH-11]] satellite system.

[[Image:TIROS-1-Earth.png|thumb|left|The first television image of Earth from space transmitted by the [[TIROS-1]] weather satellite in 1960.]]
All satellite images produced by [[NASA]] are published by [[NASA Earth Observatory]] and are freely available to the public. Several other countries have satellite imaging programs, and a collaborative European effort launched the [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]] and [[Envisat]] satellites carrying various sensors. There are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery. In the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable, easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations.

== Uses ==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|width=200|align=right|image1=Nasa blue marble.jpg|image2=Crops Kansas AST 20010624.jpg|caption1=Satellite photography can be used to produce composite images of an entire hemisphere|caption2=...or to map a small area of the Earth, such as this photo of the countryside of [[Haskell County, Kansas|Haskell County]], [[Kansas]], United States.}}

Satellite images have many applications in [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], [[Biodiversity#Conservation|biodiversity conservation]], [[forestry]], [[landscape]], [[geology]], [[cartography]], [[regional planning]], [[education]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and [[war]]fare. Images can be in visible colors and in other [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]]. There are also elevation maps, usually made by radar images. Interpretation and analysis of satellite imagery is conducted using specialized [[remote sensing software]].

== Resolution and data ==
There are four types of resolution when discussing satellite imagery in remote sensing:  spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric.  Campbell (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J.  B.  2002.  Introduction to Remote Sensing.  New York  London: The Guilford Press{{Pages needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines these as follows:
* spatial resolution is defined as the pixel size of an image representing the size of the surface area (i.e. m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) being measured on the ground, determined by the sensors' instantaneous field of view (IFOV);
* spectral resolution is defined by the wavelength interval size (discrete segment of the Electromagnetic Spectrum) and number of intervals that the sensor is measuring;
* temporal resolution is defined by the amount of time (e.g. days) that passes between imagery collection periods for a given surface location
*Radiometric resolution is defined as the ability of an imaging system to record many levels of brightness (contrast for example) and to the effective bit-depth of the sensor (number of grayscale levels) and is typically expressed as 8-bit (0-255), 11-bit (0-2047), 12-bit (0-4095) or 16-bit (0-65,535).
* Geometric resolution refers to the satellite sensor's ability to effectively image a portion of the Earth's surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of [[Ground sample distance]], or GSD. GSD is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can "see" an object on the ground within a single pixel. For example, the GSD of Landsat is ~30m, which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is ~30m x 30m. The latest commercial satellite (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m. This compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based [[Reconnaissance satellite]] such as [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]].{{Citation needed|reason=Campbell, J.  B.  2002, above, is said to define only spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions.|date=September 2016}}

The [[image resolution|resolution]] of satellite images varies depending on the instrument used and the altitude of the satellite's orbit. For example, the [[Landsat]] archive offers repeated imagery at 30 meter resolution for the planet, but most of it has not been processed from the raw data. [[Landsat 7]] has an average return period of 16 days. For many smaller areas, images with resolution as high as 41&amp;nbsp;cm can be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=grayaudio on Mar 15, 2010 |url=http://hothardware.com/News/Worlds-HighestResolution-Satellite-Imagery/ |title=World's Highest-Resolution Satellite Imagery |publisher=HotHardware |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite imagery is sometimes supplemented with [[aerial photography]], which has higher resolution, but is more expensive per square meter. Satellite imagery can be combined with vector or raster data in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] provided that the imagery has been spatially rectified so that it will properly align with other data sets.

==Imaging satellites==
{{main|Earth observing satellites}}

===GeoEye===

GeoEye's [[GeoEye-1]] satellite was launched on September 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN0633403420080906?sp=true |last=Shall |first=Andrea |title=GeoEye launches high-resolution satellite |agency= Reuters |accessdate=2008-11-07 | date=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GeoEye-1 satellite has the high resolution imaging system and is able to collect images with a ground resolution of 0.41&amp;nbsp;meters (16&amp;nbsp;inches) in the panchromatic or black and white mode. It collects multispectral or color imagery at 1.65-meter resolution or about 64&amp;nbsp;inches.

===DigitalGlobe===

DigitalGlobe's [[WorldView-2]] satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.46 m spatial resolution (panchromatic only).&lt;ref name="urlBall Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=81 |title=Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. |accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 0.46 meters resolution of WorldView-2's [[panchromatic]] images allows the satellite to distinguish between objects on the ground that are at least 46&amp;nbsp;cm apart. Similarly DigitalGlobe's [[QuickBird]] satellite provides 0.6 meter resolution (at NADIR) panchromatic images.

DigitalGlobe's [[WorldView-3]] satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.31 m spatial resolution. WVIII also carries a short wave infrared sensor and an atmospheric sensor&lt;ref name="urlDigitalGlobe WorldView3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/|title=High Resolution Aerial Satellite Images &amp; Photos|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spot Image===
[[File:Bratislava SPOT 1027.jpg|thumb|right|SPOT image of [[Bratislava]]]]
The 3 [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellites]] in orbit (Spot 2, 4 and 5) provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 2.5 m to 1&amp;nbsp;km. Spot Image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites, in particular from Formosat-2 (Taiwan) and Kompsat-2 (South Korea) and from radar satellites (TerraSar-X, ERS, Envisat, Radarsat). [[Spot Image]] is also the exclusive distributor of data from the high resolution [[Pleiades satellites]] with a resolution of 0.50 meter or about 20&amp;nbsp;inches. The launches occurred in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The company also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing, as well as added value options.

===ASTER===

The [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer]] (ASTER) is an imaging instrument onboard Terra, the flagship satellite of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) launched in December 1999. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems). ASTER data is used to create detailed maps of land surface temperature, reflectance, and elevation. The coordinated system of EOS satellites, including Terra, is a major component of NASA's Science Mission Directorate and the Earth Science Division. The goal of NASA Earth Science is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, its response to change, and to better predict variability and trends in climate, weather, and natural hazards.&lt;ref name="Jet Propulsion Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/mission.asp |title=ASTER Project |access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Land surface climatology—investigation of land surface parameters, surface temperature, etc., to understand land-surface interaction and energy and moisture fluxes
* Vegetation and ecosystem dynamics—investigations of vegetation and soil distribution and their changes to estimate biological productivity, understand land-atmosphere interactions, and detect ecosystem change
* Volcano monitoring—monitoring of eruptions and precursor events, such as gas emissions, eruption plumes, development of lava lakes, eruptive history and eruptive potential
* Hazard monitoring—observation of the extent and effects of wildfires, flooding, coastal erosion, earthquake damage, and tsunami damage
* Hydrology—understanding global energy and hydrologic processes and their relationship to global change; included is evapotranspiration from plants
* Geology and soils—the detailed composition and geomorphologic mapping of surface soils and bedrocks to study land surface processes and earth's history
* Land surface and land cover change—monitoring desertification, deforestation, and urbanization; providing data for conservation managers to monitor protected areas, national parks, and wilderness areas

===BlackBridge===

[[BlackBridge]], previously known as [[RapidEye]], operates a constellation of five satellites, launched in August 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapideye.net/upload/Press_Releases/2008/PR_Announcement_SuccessfulLaunch_EN_29.08.2008.pdf |title=RapidEye Press Release |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RapidEye constellation contains identical [[multispectral]]  sensors which are equally calibrated. Therefore, an image from one satellite will be equivalent to an image from any of the other four, allowing for a large amount of imagery to be collected (4 million km² per day), and daily revisit to an area. Each travel on the same orbital plane at 630&amp;nbsp;km, and deliver images in 5 meter pixel size. [[RapidEye]] satellite imagery is especially suited for agricultural, environmental, cartographic and disaster management applications. The company not only offers their imagery, but consults their customers to create services and solutions based on analysis of this imagery .

===ImageSat International===
[[EROS (satellite)|Earth Resource Observation Satellites]], better known as “EROS” satellites, are lightweight, low earth orbiting, high-resolution satellites designed for fast maneuvering between imaging targets. In the commercial high-resolution satellite market, EROS is the smallest very high resolution satellite; it is very agile and thus enables very high performances. The satellites are deployed in a circular sun-synchronous near polar orbit at an altitude of 510&amp;nbsp;km (+/- 40&amp;nbsp;km).
EROS satellites imagery applications are primarily for intelligence, homeland security and national development purposes but also employed in a wide range of civilian applications, including: mapping, border control, infrastructure planning, agricultural monitoring, [[environmental monitoring]], disaster response, training and simulations, etc.

EROS A – a high resolution satellite with 1.9-1.2m resolution panchromatic was launched on December 5, 2000.

EROS B - the second generation of Very High Resolution satellites with 70&amp;nbsp;cm resolution panchromatic, was launched on April 25, 2006.

===Meteosat===
[[File:EUMETSAT Meteosat model.jpg|thumb|Model of a first generation Meteosat geostationary satellite.]]

The [[Meteosat]]-2 geostationary weather satellite began operationally to supply imagery data on 16 August 1981. [[Eumetsat]] has operated the Meteosats since 1987.
*The ''[[Meteosat visible and infrared imager]] (MVIRI)'', three-channel imager: visible, infrared and water vapour; It operates on the first generation [[Meteosat]], Meteosat-7 being still active. 
*The 12-channel ''Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI)'' includes similar channels to those used by MVIRI, providing continuity in climate data over three decades; [[Meteosat Second Generation]] (MSG).
*The ''Flexible Combined Imager (FCI)'' on [[Meteosat#Third Generation ("MTG")|Meteosat Third Generation]] (MTG) will also include similar channels, meaning that all three generations will have provided over 60 years of climate data.

==Disadvantages==
Because the total area of the land on Earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high, satellite databases are huge and [[image processing]] (creating useful images from the raw data) is time-consuming.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Depending on the [[sensor]] used, weather conditions can affect image quality: for example, it is difficult to obtain images for areas of frequent cloud cover such as mountain-tops.  For such reasons, publicly available satellite image datasets are typically processed for visual or scientific commercial use by third parties.

Commercial satellite companies do not place their imagery into the public domain and do not sell their imagery; instead, one must be licensed to use their imagery. Thus, the ability to legally make derivative products from commercial satellite imagery is minimized.

[[Privacy]] concerns have been brought up by some who wish not to have their property shown from above. Google Maps responds to such concerns in their [[FAQ]] with the following statement: "''We understand your privacy concerns... The images that Google Maps displays are no different from what can be seen by anyone who flies over or drives by a specific geographic location.''"&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Betts told the Associated Press (2007) http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070312-google-censor_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The School of Geography''' is part of the Faculty of Environment at [[The University of Leeds]] based in the [[UK]].

== History ==
[[The University of Leeds]] was one of the earliest British universities to establish a school of [[geography]] in 1919. Various types of geography, including commercial geography, had been taught at the Yorkshire College (which preceded the University of Leeds) and in the university [[economics]] department before 1919. This reflects an earlier and broader European interest in the use of geographical knowledge as an aid to national and international trade. The early, inter-war years were characterized by small numbers of staff and honours students, very few research students, and limited resources and range of topics covered. The school has generally expanded over the years and in 2011 has about 70 members of academic staff and a large number of research students studying a broad spectrum of geographical topics.

A celebrated historical geographer, [[Robin Butlin]] has developed a history of the school and presented this twice at anniversary celebrations. Hopefully some of this material will become linked here in due course. (Unfortunately neither of these presentations were video recorded.)

In the recent past the school was the hub of a major [[glaciology]] research group headed by [[Tavi Murray]] now based at the University of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://ralph.swan.ac.uk/glaciology/people/tmurray/
| title       = Professor Tavi Murray's Web Page 
| accessdate  = 2011-05-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various notable people have worked or studied in the school including: [[Danny Dorling]] and [[Stan Openshaw]]; [[Martine Croxall]] and [[Piers Sellers]]. Other notable people are still based there albeit in an emeritus capacity including [[Robin Butlin]], [[Mike Kirkby]] and [[Phil Rees (academic)|Phil Rees]].

== Teaching ==
One of the larger geography departments in the UK, with over 600 single honours undergraduate students, 55 masters students and 60 research postgraduate students in 2011. It offers a range of BA and BSc [[undergraduate]] programmes some offered in conjunction with other university departments, including, the Institute for Transport Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Scott Polar Research Institute''' ('''SPRI''') is a centre for research into the [[polar region]]s and [[glaciology]] worldwide. It is a sub-department of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], located on [[Lensfield Road]] in the south of [[Cambridge]] ({{coord|52|11|54.40|N|0|07|34.45|E}}).

==Purpose==
[[File:Bust Scott Geograph-1422431-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] by [[Kathleen Scott]]]]
[[File:Youth-lawrence-cambridge-2017.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The statue of 'Youth' (1920) by Kathleen Scott for which [[A. W. Lawrence]] was the model]]
SPRI was founded by [[Frank Debenham]] in 1920 as the national memorial to Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his companions, who died on their return journey from the [[South Pole]] in 1912. It investigates issues relevant to the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] in the [[environmental science]]s, [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The institute has some 60 personnel, consisting of academic, library and support staff plus postgraduate students, associates and fellows attached to research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/ Welcome to SPRI] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also hosts the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]], and is part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.

==Resources==
The Grade II listed main building  (1933–34) is by [[Sir Herbert Baker]]. The  small halls have shallow domed ceilings painted with the aspect of the globe from north and south poles, by [[MacDonald Gill]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England entry| num=1268369 |desc=Scott Polar Research Institute |grade=II |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Scott Polar Research Institute houses the world's most comprehensive polar library and archives.&lt;ref name= "SPRI website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/overview.html|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Library|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Archive contains an unparalleled collection of manuscript material relating to the polar regions, research and exploration. For scientists and scholars, the library offers a collection developed since the 1920s covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and to ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.

The Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/25/world/thomas-manning-86-explorer-known-as-lone-wolf-of-arctic.html|title=Thomas Manning, 86, Explorer Known as Lone Wolf of Arctic|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|date=25 November 1998|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work includes an [[oral history]] programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Polar Archives|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most recent addition to the library is the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/building/ The Shackleton Memorial Library] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material.

The library is part of the Inspire Libraries scheme&lt;ref&gt;http://inspire-libraries.org.uk/participating-libraries/?task=view&amp;id=1558&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research.

==The Polar Museum==

==Research==
SPRI has several research groups.

===Glaciology and Climate Change Group===
This group's work involves quantifying the state of the [[cryosphere]] using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding [[global warming|climate change]].

===Glacimarine Environments Group===
This group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by [[icebreaker]]s in the polar seas.

===Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group===
This group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.

===Polar Social Science and Humanities Group===
This is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the [[Russia]]n North.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Tacheometry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|k|i|ˈ|ɒ|m|ᵻ|t|r|i}}; from Greek for "quick measure"), is a system of rapid [[surveying]], by which the horizontal and vertical positions of points on the earth's surface relative to one another are determined without using a chain or tape, or a separate levelling instrument.
Instead of the pole formerly employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a [[level staff]] is used. This is marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the form of [[tacheometer]] in use. 

The horizontal distance is inferred from the vertical angle included between two well-defined points on the staff and the known vertical distance between them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed [[Stadia mark|stadia]] wires in the diaphragm ([[reticle]]) of the [[telescope]]. The difference of height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. 
The [[azimuth]] angle is determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point both vertically and horizontally with reference to the point where the tacheometer is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff.

The ordinary methods of surveying with a [[theodolite]], [[surveyor's chain|chain,]] and [[levelling]] instrument are fairly satisfactory when the ground is relatively clear of obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when the ground is covered with [[Shrub|bush]], or broken up by [[ravine]]s. Chain measurements then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss of accuracy. These difficulties led to the introduction of tacheometry.

In western countries, tacheometry is primarily of historical interest in surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using [[total station]]s and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also determined using [[GNSS]].  Traditional methods and instruments are still in use in many areas of the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors.

==Tacheometer==
A ''tachymeter'' or ''tacheometer'' is a type of [[theodolite]] used for rapid [[measurement]]s and determines, electronically or electro-optically, the distance to target. The principles of action are similar to those of [[rangefinder]]s.

==Stadia measurements==
Other forms of tacheometry in surveying include the use of '''[[stadia rod]]s''' with theodolites or [[plane table|plane-table]] [[alidade]]s.&lt;ref name="dfk"&gt;Raymond Davis, Francis Foote, Joe Kelly, ''Surveying, Theory and Practice'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966 LC 64-66263&lt;/ref&gt; These use [[stadia mark]]s on the instrument's [[reticle]] to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the ''stadia interval factor''. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.

The formula most widely used for finding the distances is:

&lt;math&gt;
d = ks + c
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the stadia interval (top intercept minus bottom intercept); &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are multiplicative and additive constants. Generally, the instrument is made so that &lt;math&gt;k = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; exactly, to simplify calculations.

==Subtense bars==
[[Image:Subtense Bar.jpg|thumb|Wild brand subtense bar]]
Another device used in tacheometry is the ''subtense bar''.&lt;ref name="dfk"/&gt; This is a rigid rod, usually of a material insensitive to change in temperature such as [[invar]], of fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small [[telescope]] on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular to the line of sight to the angle measuring station.

A theodolite is used to measure the angle between indicators on the two ends of the subtense bar. The distance from the telescope to the subtense bar is the height of an [[isosceles triangle]] formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex and the subtense bar length at its base, determined by [[trigonometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Topocide''' is the deliberate culling of a [[Location (geography)|place]] through industrial expansion and change, so that its earlier [[landscape]] and character are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Kelly|title=AP Human Geography 2009|year=2009|publisher=Kaplan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative term is [[domicide]], the destruction of home; the two may be viewed as synonyms or they may be opposed, with topocide referring to destruction from the point of view of the destroyers (generally outsiders) and domicide from the point of view of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porteous|first=Douglas|title=Domicide: The Global Destruction Of Home|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOwb3IXYfoEC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false|author2=Sandra E. Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Topocide can be the result of deliberate industrial expansion. When industries form, then the people's center of life revolve around that industry. New jobs are formed and the environmental and cultural landscape is forever changed.

Arguable examples include the destruction of [[Dresden]] at the end of World War II and the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s destruction in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Andrew E|title=Disaster and Development|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDfqfikFDmsC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=topocide&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=topocide&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''True north''' (also called '''geodetic north''') is the direction along [[Earth]]'s surface towards the geographic [[North Pole]].

[[geodesy|Geodetic]] north differs from ''magnetic'' north (the direction a [[points of the compass|compass points]] toward the [[Magnetic North Pole]]), and from [[grid north]] (the direction northwards along the grid lines of a [[map projection]]). Geodetic true north also differs very slightly from ''astronomical'' true north (typically by a few [[arcsecond]]s) because the local [[gravity]] may not point at the exact [[axis of rotation|rotational axis]] of Earth.

The direction of astronomical true north is marked in the skies by the north [[celestial pole]]. This is within about 1° of the position of [[Polaris]], so that [[pole star|the star]] would appear to [[star trail|trace]] a tiny circle in the sky each [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]. Due to the [[axial precession]] of Earth, true north rotates in an arc with respect to [[fixed stars|the stars]] that takes approximately 25,000 years to complete. Around 2100–02, Polaris will make its closest approach to the celestial north pole (extrapolated from recent Earth precession).&lt;ref&gt;Meeus (1997), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McClure |first=Bruce |year=2013 |url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star |title=Polaris is the North Star |work=Astronomy Essentials |publisher=[[EarthSky]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smiley |first1=C. H. |last2=Majid Khan |first2=A. |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1959JRASC..53..249S/0000251.000.html |title=Polaris and Precession |work=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=53 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible star nearest the north celestial pole 5,000 years ago was [[Thuban]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath (2004), p. 5. "Around 4800 years ago Thuban ({{GreekFont|α}} Draconis) lay a mere 0°.1 from the pole. Deneb ({{GreekFont|α}} Cygni) will be the brightest star near the pole in about 8000 years' time, at a distance of 7°.5."&lt;/ref&gt;

On maps published by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and the [[United States Armed Forces]], true north is marked with a line terminating in a five-pointed star. The east and west edges of the USGS topographic quadrangle maps of the United States are [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]s of [[longitude]], thus indicating true north (so they are not exactly parallel). Maps issued by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Ordnance Survey]] contain a diagram showing the difference between true north, grid north, and magnetic north at a point on the sheet; the edges of the map are likely to follow grid directions rather than true, and the map will thus be truly rectangular/square.
